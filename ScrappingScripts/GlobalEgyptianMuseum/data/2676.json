From parallels it seems certain that this figure was one of hundreds buried with two women of this name in the Theban family tomb of the high priest of Amun, Menkheperre, in the 21st Dynasty. One was the daughter, and the other perhaps the grand-daughter of that influential official, effective ruler of southern Egypt in the late eleventh century BC."}
