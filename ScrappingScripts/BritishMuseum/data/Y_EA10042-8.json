C. Harris a consul general in Alexandria who bought the manuscript in 1855 was first edited by F. Chabas (Chabas 1860). Chabas worked not on the original for his publication but on a copy made by tracing. In those days, the papyrus was entirely preserved. In between the acquisition in 1855 by Harris and the selling year 1872, a massive gun powder explosion took place in Alexandria which damaged Harris\u2019 house and his private collection, too. In 1872, the papyrus was sold with other objects to the British Museum. Of the original nine pages of the recto and three of the verso, only the first six pages of the recto and parts of the second page of the verso (page 11) are preserved. The other pages only exist in fragments, see Lange 1927, 5\u20136."], "Bibliographic references": [" Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (381225) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/381225) ", " Chabas 1860 / Le papyrus magique Harris.
