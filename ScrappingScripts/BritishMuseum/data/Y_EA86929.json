{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86929"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is showing impressions of two small coils of basketry on one side and another wider coil of basketry on the second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows three quarters of an impression of a scarab-like seal. The seal impression shows a circumferential line. The right part of the seal is partly missing, visible is a smA-sign (F36) in the middle, with a spiral in the middle part and several floral branches leading away from it. On each side of the smA an animal, probably a scorpion? The area where the seal impression is not preserved shows an impression of a string.
