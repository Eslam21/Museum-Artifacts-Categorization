It has a very short neck and two pierced handles. The first two, right-hand, bands of inscription contain the cartouche with the throne name of the female ruler, \"Maat-Ka-Ra, given long life, beloved of Amun-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands\". The other two left-hand vertical columns contain the birth name \"Son of Re, of his body, Hatshepsut, Khenmet Amun, may she live forever, justified by Osiris, the Great God\". The lower horizontal line identifies the contents as \"Vase for Amun, containing 24.5\". It is obvious that this vase was used for the preservation of oils or unguents for Queen Hatshepsut."}
