Whilst Lemos identifies the sherd as coming from an oinochoe, the sherd most likely comes from a dinos. Chian dinoi were not slipped on the interior and Williams notes the dinos sherds are often mistaken for oinochoai because of this (Williams 2006a, 128). Furthermore, Williams argues that British Museum 1888,0601.499.g, 1888,0601.499.b, 1888,0601.443 and 1924,1201.21 all belong to the same dinos (Williams 2006a, 132 note 29). 1924,1201.21 is an incorrect registration number for 1888,0601.460.c, while 1888,0601.443, which is an Attic black figure band cup, will be an error for 1924,1201.443, which is decorated in similar fashion to the sherds from the dinos and has a similar slip, fabric and thickness."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
