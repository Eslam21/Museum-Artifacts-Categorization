This false door stela comes from Herakleopolis Magna. It was not found in situ, but we know that its owner was a woman called Neferet. On the central panel, she is depicted sitting in front of the offering table; and on the two jambs, she is shown standing up, in profile, looking inwards. The inscription consists of the common funerary meal formulae, calling up Osiris and Anubis with their traditional epithets."}
