Harpokrates seated on the ground, his knees widespread, his feet close together. He is naked and has a large phallus, its tip resting on the top of a plain, curve-fronted plinth. Except for a side-lock his head is shaven, and he has a ribbon tied round it with lotus buds at the top; his fingers are lifted to his mouth. He holds a pot to his left side, with his left hand. Plain back, with circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with traces of an overall white dressing. Pink paint survives on the flesh, with some red paint on the phallus and around the pot.
