{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1903:712-714", "Dating": "EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "FOOD OFFERING (MODEL) ?", "Material": "CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Width": "2 cm", "Name": "Twists of mud deposited as offerings", "Description": "Part of a large find of twisted rods of mud, deposited as if a votive offering or part of a rite of protection, at the temple of Osiris at Abydos. The find was dated by the excavator to the Old Kingdom, but parallels from more recent excavations suggest a date in the Early Dynastic Period. At that time the cult of Osiris is not attested at Abydos; instead the local deity was a royal funerary god Khentimentiu 'Foremost of the Westerners', associated with the burials of the first kings of Egypt in the desert at the site."}
