{"artifact_name": "jar-label", "Object Type": ["jar-label"], "Museum number": ["EA32650"], "Description": [" Part of an ebony oil label: restored from two fragments, with a hole for attachment at the top right-hand corner. The front surface bears an incised inscription, arranged vertically on the left side and in four horizontal registers on the right. These four registers are bordered by a large 'rnpt' hieroglyph, indicating that the text records the events of a particular year. The top register bears a scene of the Sed-festival, showing the king wearing the double crown, running as part of the ritual and seated on a throne in a booth. The meaning of the lower registers is not entirely clear, but they include references to the destruction of a stronghold and the taking of captives.
