{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 36909", "Dating": "TUTHMOSIS III/MENKHEPERRE", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SCHIST", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "68 cm", "Name": "Double Statue of Tuthmosis the Third and Amun-Re", "Description": "A fine sculptured double statue of Tuthmosis the third and the god Amun-Re. They embrace each other in a nice gesture of unity. The king is wearing the high Atef crown with the double plumes and two ram's horns. Under it, he wears the linen Nemes royal headdress. He wears the ceremonial wavy false beard of royalty. The king has handsome, soft features and an aquiline nose. The slim torso shows him to be a youthful and athletic person. He is dressed in a short, pleated royal kilt and holds the Ankh sign of long life. On the right side of the statue is an inscription giving the king's name and epithet: \"The god lord, Men-Kheper-Ra, may he be given long life.\"The god's figure is largely broken and missing, and there was an attempt to restore it in ancient times. This is apparent from the grooves cut in the upper part to insert the broken pieces in their proper places."}
