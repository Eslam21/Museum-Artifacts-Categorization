", " Lemos places this sherd in Group C of the Black Figure Komast Chalices. Unlike the other groups, this is not a coherent group. Most chalices in this group have a rim pattern, filling ornament is absent and incision is very carefully and delicately executed. Williams argues that the images portrayed on the komast chalices were perhaps representations of komos activities that took place in Chios. The buttock pads exaggerated the dancers\u2019 bottoms. The sakkos worn by many of these komasts as well as the earrings suggest the dancers, who were male, were practicing a form of transvestism. If so, these Chians dancers were precursors of the magodoi or performers who wore women\u2019s clothing, made lewd gestures and performed as female and drunk characters. The gestures of the dancers on the chalices are limited and consist of holding pomegranates, tambourines (or wreaths) and snapping fingers. Such dances may also have been connected to religious festivals and performed after religious feasts.
