The top is striped with black lines and the two pillars resemble the hieroglyphic sign of the horizon. The upper part of the stela contains the winged sun disk, painted in black. Below the sun disk is a scene of the mummified Apis bull crouching on a pedestal. The body and legs of the bull are wrapped in a grid-patterned cloth. Before the Apis bull is a table filled with provisions and a flower. There are flower buds on both sides of the table. The lower part of the stela shows a kneeling man wearing a short kilt and wig. He supports, with his left hand, an offering basket on his head. The text inscribed in black ink reinforces the notion of Osiris in the form of Apis and gives the name of the dedicator of the stela."}
