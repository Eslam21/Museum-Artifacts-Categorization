{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1913:235", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "IBIS MUMMY", "Material": "LINEN", "Name": "Mummified ibis", "Description": "Mummified ibis from the large cemetery of ibis at Abydos. The bird was used in Egyptian formal art to depict the god of knowledge, Thoth. From the Late Period to the Roman Period literally millions of birds and animals were mummified and buried in great catacombs. The reasons for the practice are not certain. The tombs seem to have been cut at the expense of the state, which seems also to have funded the staff for the cults. Numerous inscriptions confirm that private individuals might offer a mummified bird or animal."}
