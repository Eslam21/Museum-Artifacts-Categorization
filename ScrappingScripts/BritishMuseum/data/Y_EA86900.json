{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86900"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration with a partly glossy surface. The rear shows a convex surface like from a leather bag and perpendicular to this one impression of a thin turned cord with a width of 0.22 cm in the break. The front has a small flat area, the lateral sides bend downwards. On the flat part the upper half of an oval scarab-like seal-impression is preserved, showing the god Ptah in mummy-form in the middle, facing towards the left, holding a wAs-sceptre in front of him. Small hieroglyphs above this figure, nb ... (qnb.t?) . In front of him another sign, maybe two Dd-pillars with each a seated falcon on top (?). Behind the god another standing figure, maybe Sekhmet, with a sceptre in front of her, above a sun-disc. The rest is broken off. Same motif on EA86898.
