{"artifact_name": "spacer-bead(?); ornament", "Object Type": [" spacer-bead (?) ", " ornament "], "Museum number": ["EA58320"], "Description": [" Spacer-bead (?) in Egyptian blue in the shape of a Hathoric head: of classic type, a basic detail of sistra and related objects. The face of the goddess is repeated on both sides and the gold (nbw) sign is represented below her head. The modelling is exceptionally flat with the details of the faces incised rather crudely after moulding. The intended use of the object is not apparent, but it might have been used as a spacer-bead. It is pierced vertically with a relatively wide bore. Horizontally it is pierced three times through the sides and again horizontally at the lower front surface, just below the collar of beads. The fabric is of the chalky, fine-grained, soft type and is light-blue in colour. Smooth almost soapy to touch.
