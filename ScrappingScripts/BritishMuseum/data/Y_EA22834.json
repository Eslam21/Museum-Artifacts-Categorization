{"artifact_name": "adze", "Object Type": ["adze"], "Museum number": ["EA22834"], "Description": [" Adze: a heavy wooden adze with a bronze blade and leather lashing. The blade is splayed a bit at the bottom and has a slightly curved cutting edge. Its sides taper inward near the top, where they again splay out into a flattened knob. The blade was lashed to the handle while the leather strapping was wet and elastic, so that when it dried the blade would fit tightly against the haft. Since the blade tapers gradually outward at the bottom, however, repeated blows pushing the blade upward would have had the effect of first tightening the lashing somewhat, then eventually stretching and loosening it.

Adzes and hoes are structurally much the same, with the blade at a right angle to the handle. Since the action involved with both is one of striking out and pulling back, it is possible that the form and employment of a primitive forked-branch hoe suggested the specialization of the form (with the addition of a blade) for woodworking purposes. Adzes were used by woodworkers for cutting and trimming rough wooden planks and shaping and smoothing wooden surfaces. They thus acted both as carving knives and as planes, neither of which was known to the Egyptians. In the tomb of Rekhmire carpenters can be seen using adzes for smoothing planks, shaping furniture legs, and carving the elements of an openwork shrine. After the initial carving of an object, a fine finish would be given to the wood with some sort of abrasive stone rubber or scraper. Bibliography: S. Clarke & R.
