The piece would be Attic if there were examples of double, rather than triple dividing rings on Attic cups of the period c.570-550. ", " The sherd belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965,0930.852 and 1965,0930.853. Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the decorative motif finds parallels with his South Ionian little master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9C. Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana, Band, and Gordion cups. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus.
