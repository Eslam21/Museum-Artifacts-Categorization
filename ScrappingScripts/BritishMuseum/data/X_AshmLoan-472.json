The findspot - bottom of well 50, in a seemingly residential area in the southwestern part of the site - is indicated by Hogarth (1898-9, p. 41), who describes the well as follows: \"The well, marked 50, was cleared by us to the bottom at 26 feet from the surface. It is 50 inches in diameter and lined with tiles disposed in rings. It proved richer in pottery than the other two wells cleared by us, producing fragments of figured Naukratite vases from 12 to 14 feet down (v. infra p. 59 and P1. VII. I), and four inscribed sherds from the very bottom (No. 41 and three small fragments) as well as large coarse pots, goat and ibex horns, stone weights, and a piece of a small and interesting early stone figure.\" ", " Hogarth explains how this sherd was found inside Well 50 south-west of the Hellenion.
