{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA2338"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone male figure, the head and part of the upper body remaining. The figure wears a long curled lappet-wig that partially covers the ears. The right side of the head does not continue the same patterned hairstyle. His eyes are hooded with a thin incised line at the crease above the eyelid and a subtle ridge above conveying his eyebrows. The flesh underneath the eyes appears slightly sunken. The remains of the nose suggest a broad outline, while his mouth is small with thick lips. The outer corners of his mouth are slightly upturned, creating a subtle smile. There is a visible depression under the mouth suggesting a dimple at the chin. At the shoulders are visible ridges of his clothing, though there are no traces of a neckline. On the reverse are the remains of the top of a back-pillar or more likely part of a seat. There appears to be no visible text inscribed. In addition to the statue body being broken from the chest area, the nose is missing and there is damage to the face across both sides and at the left eye and forehead. There are a number of smaller scratches and chips across the stone surface.

The smooth section of the wig on the right side and the broadness of the sloping back-pillar or seat that extends further out to the right are possibly the result of this belonging to a group statue, in which case the artist may have left the right side of the wig unfinished if it was difficult to reach.
