{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 29530", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "CYMBAL", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Diameter": "15 cm", "Name": "Pair of Cymbals with Concentric Circles", "Description": "The rims of the cymbals are relatively large in comparison with the central calotte. The external surface is decorated with many concentric circles, while the internal surface is undecorated. The sound of these cymbals is beautiful and very rich in harmony; cymbals have a sound that is similar to bells or gongs. The role of the sound of the cymbals used in Egyptian temples was to please the gods and to repel evil spirits. The Egyptian Coptic church has, to this day, kept the tradition going by using cymbals in some of its rituals."}
