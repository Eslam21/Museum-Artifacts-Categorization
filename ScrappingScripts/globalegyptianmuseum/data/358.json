He is dressed in the double crown of Egypt symbolising his reign over the country after the death of his brother Osiris. The cult of Seth, god of Ombos in Upper Egypt, knew its apogee in the Ramesside Period, specifically favouring his warlike character. It is very probable that the piece dates from this period."}
