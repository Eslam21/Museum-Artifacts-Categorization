This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The amulet, with its very degenerate shape, could correspond to a Djed pillar (on Djed pillar amulets see: Andrews 1994, 82-83; Herrmann et al. 2010, 147-148, type 94), or relates to the Egyptian deities Shu or Heh always represented with their hands raised on both sides of their head (on amulets of Shu and Heh : Andrews 1994, 19 and 88-89; Herrmann et al. 2010, 51-52, type 20). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
