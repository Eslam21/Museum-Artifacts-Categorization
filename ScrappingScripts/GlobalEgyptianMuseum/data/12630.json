The heavy, dotted lappet wig is crowned with four fillets: a checkered band with large rectangles, two checkered bands with small rectangles and one with stylized flower petals. The face is protected on the left by a winged uraeus. Probably there was another uraeus on the right. The collar is relatively small. The lappets of the wig end in four horizontal bands: one with stripes, a multicoloured checkered band, a broad one with udjat-eyes, and one with multicoloured dots. The wig is framed by a dotted band and a 'plaited' pattern at the back. The closed, but empty hands are modelled on the surface; they are half covered by broad bracelets in the same pattern as the collar."}
