{"artifact_name": "cart; model", "Object Type": [" cart ", " model "], "Museum number": ["1989,0811.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta model of a two-wheeled cart with a driver. A cart in a religious procession, carrying temple treasure, probably silver plate: two large round dishes, a rectangular lanx with handles, and a skyphos. The cart, modelled in the round, with two wheels of eight spokes, is of a high and semicircular form, probably made of wickerwork on a wooden frame, with a box-base, resting on the axle and projecting front and back. The driver, apparently with a shaved head and wearing a short tunic, sits on the front projection; the rear projection is decorated with diagonal grooves and impressed points. Similar decoration is found on the front of the cart itself, flanking the driver. A very small firing-vent is pierced through the bottom of one wheel. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt.
