The rear shows a flat area with the impression of some plant fibres (papyrus?) and two impressions of an unturned cord with a width of 0.13 cm. The front has a flat area that bends downwards to all sides. On the flat area a complete oval scarab-like seal-impression with finger imprints around it. Visible is a standing animal like a horse (?) with bent head and underneath turned by 180 degrees a crocodile with long tail whose curve follows the outline of the seal. The same motif is found on EA86895, EA86942 and EA86947.
