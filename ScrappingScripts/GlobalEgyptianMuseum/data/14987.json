{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 44884", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "10 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a Child Named Iy", "Description": "The child is depicted standing with his left leg set slightly forward on a rectangular base. He is nude and his head is shaved. This is unlike the traditional Ancient Egyptian portrayal of children with side locks. His closed left hand hangs by his side and the right hand is raised with the forefinger on his lower lip in a gesture that probably indicates shyness in Egyptian art. He wears relatively large earrings. On top of the base, offering formulas are inscribed in hieroglyphic lines."}
