{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 38947", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "58 cm", "Name": "Head of the goddess Hathor", "Description": "This finely carved head of a goddess wearing a short curly wig is exquisitely rendered with horizontal incisions. The wig surrounds her small-featured face. She has almond-shaped eyes, thin arching eyebrows, round cheeks, a thin nose, and small puckered lips. The goddess is wearing a large crown in the shape of a temple facade, which is decorated with a cornice and flanked with two large coiled signs. The entrance of the temple is filled by a uraeus with a sun disk. The shape of this crown helps to identify this divinity as the goddess Hathor. This type of head, decorated with a large object on top, was uncommon in artistic practice during earlier periods in ancient Egypt. The style seems to have emerged during the Late Period."}
