{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1342"], "Description": [" White limestone false-door of Qar: at the top there is a plain cavetto-cornice and the inscribed area is surrounded by a plain forus-moulding. The lintel and outer jamb-panels contain offering-formulas and a short, similar text is cut on the smaller, subsidiary lintel. The inner jamb-panels carry the titles and dignities of Qar. There are four standing figures of the deceased at the bottoms of the vertical lines of text. In the panel above the doorway Qar is represented seated at an offering-table piled high with conventional sliced loaves; beneath the table a ewer and basin are shown and above the table is a short offering-text. The scene and texts on the door are incised. The work is, in general, of moderate quality only. The lower surface of the slab is much weathered and the whole surface has suffered from flaking due to the action of salt. No colour remains.
