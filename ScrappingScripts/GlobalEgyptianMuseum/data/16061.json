{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 14141", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Width": "25 cm", "Name": "Painting of Zeus and Leda", "Description": "A painted low-relief depicts Zeus and Leda. Zeus was well known for his continuous passion for beautiful women. He fell in love with Leda at first sight, and insisted on becoming close to her. He took the shape of a swan and abducted her, attacking her with the help of Eros, the god of love. The influence of the Ancient Greek mythology in the Christian era is shown in the engraving, despite the opposition of Christianity's ideas and teachings to these legends. These mythologies remained popular, even if they lost their religious meaning for the Christians, or might have carried different metaphors to fit the teachings of the new religion."}
