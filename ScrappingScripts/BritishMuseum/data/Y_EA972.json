{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA972"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Ty: this round-topped stela bears a scene in sunk relief with incised texts. The High Priest of Ptah, Ty, is seated on the left behind an altar of offerings. On the right stands his son, the lector-priest of Bast, Say, with one arm raised and holding an incense-burner in the other. Beneath this scene there were four horizontal lines of text, of which only two are now partially preserved, containing a prayer to Ptah and Osiris on behalf of the High Priest of Ptah, Ty, son of the God's Father of Ptah, \u1e24r. The upper part is badly worn and much of the surface of the lower part of the stela is lost. There are no traces of colour.

C. Harris. The High Priest of Ptah, Ty, also called Ptahemhat, is known from several other monuments, all probably from his unlocated tomb at Saqqara (J. Malek, 'G\u00f6ttinger Miszellen' 22 (1976), 43; C.Maystre, 'Revue d'\u00c9gyptologie' 27(1975), 175-9). A companion stela of almost identical dimensions, once in the Amherst collection, had a similar text with a dedication to Ra-Horakhty and Atum (Malek, op. cit., 43-6). The tomb of Ty is usually dated to the reign of Tutankhamun or Ay (A. Schulman, 'Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt' 4 (1965), 55-68; Maystre in '\u00c4gypten und Kusch' (Berlin, 1977), 303). This dating can be reconciled with the Berlin genealogy of the High Priests of Ptah where Ty is said to have flourished in the reign of Horemheb if the suppression of the Amarna pharaohs is taken into account (L. Borchardt, 'Die Mittel zur zeitlichen Festlegung von Punkten der \u00e4gyptischen Geschichte und ihre Anwendung' (Cairo, 1935), 99 and 104). However, the accuracy of this later account for the Eighteenth Dynasty is questionable since Ty is there described as a son of the God's Father of Amun, Sokaremsaf, whereas the contemporary stelae name his father as the God's Father of Ptah, Hori, unless these references are to one and the same man with two names (as Ty/Ptahemhat had) and two titles.
