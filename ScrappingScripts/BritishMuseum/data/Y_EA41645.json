{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA41645"], "Description": [" Fragment of the back of a limestone figure, possibly a squatting or block figure. The fragment includes seven horizontal lines of incised text, each of which are missing the beginning and ending of each line. The surviving inscription evokes the goddess Hathor and the area of Thebes. There are small traces of a darker colour in some of the hieroglyph signs, At the top of the fragment is the remaining partial outline of what may have been the ends of a wig. The front of the figure has been completely broken away, and the base is also missing. The object is now attached to a modern mount.

The fragmentary text includes a name of 'her son Watiwati', suggesting that it is a female figure who is the focus of the inscription, though the language changes from first person to third person in the final line of the text. Though there is little surviving trace of the physical body of the statue, a squatting or block pose is most likely given the form of the back. Further Bibliography: E.A.W. Budge, 1914.
