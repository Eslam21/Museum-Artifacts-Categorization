Stainton, \u2018British Landscape Watercolours, 1600-1860\u2019, 1985, no. 181: Confined in 1844 to Bethlem Hospital, and from 1864 to Broadmoor, for the murder of his father, Dadd was allowed to continue painting. Even before his illness, he had been an imaginative artist of unusual perception. The present water-colour, perhaps the most intensely visionary that he painted, combines a delicacy of colour and a precision of drawing on a tiny scale. The towering pinnacle of rock surmounted by a castle seems to invoke Dadd's own seclusion in Bethlem, while the design is composed of many recognisable elements. The rock and the town clustered below are perhaps recollections of Dadd's travels to Greece, Egypt and the Middle East in 1842-3, and it has been suggested that the tower which he calls the Blinker Lighthouse could have been inspired by Eddystone. Dadd's own comment on the verso \"Not sketched from Nature\" seems almost unnecessary, yet it is of interest partly for what it reveals of his state of mind and partly because it reflects the fact that by the 1860s sketching in colours from nature had become the norm. Stephen Calloway observes that 'Dadd's precision of technique, drawing minutely with the point of a brush and applying subtly modulated washes, sreves to highlight the sense of unreality, whilst the overall pale tonality and muted colour scheme enhance the dream-like effect created by the scene'. Though the subject may be derived from scenes observed during Dadd's travels, Colloway suggests it may also be connected with the imaginative landscapes of John Martin. See R.
