{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86928"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression showing impressions of two coils of basketry on one side and another coil of basketry on the second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows one impression of an almost complete scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal impression is cut very sharply and shows a circumferential line that thickens at the top. The lower part of the seal is partly missing, visible is a bound captive on the left side, kneeling, facing towards the left, with his hands bound together at his back. Behind him on the right a seated lion with its front paws on the shoulder of the captive. Behind the back of the lion a small upright cobra, facing to the right. Underneath a bound captive, lying on his belly, with his hands and feet bound backwards. The same motif can be found on EA86927, EA86930, EA86931, EA86932, EA86933 and EA86934.
