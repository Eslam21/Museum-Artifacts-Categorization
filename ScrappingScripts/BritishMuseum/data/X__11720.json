Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DA.119) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Department": ["External"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 27?
