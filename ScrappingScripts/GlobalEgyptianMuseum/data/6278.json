This caliciform bowl has the shape of a ''tulip'', with a small, flattened base, a dark red body, a wide irregular rim and a well-defined white band in the middle. The body profile is S-shaped. The clay is very thin (less than 4mm thick) and made of fine, very shiny silt mud. Two signs were carved on the bottom of the body after firing. These symbols seem to be inspired by hieroglyphic signs, one of them the sign nefer (''beautiful, good, perfect'')."}
