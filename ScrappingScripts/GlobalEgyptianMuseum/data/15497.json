Boats were thought to be essential to the deceased for their journeys in the afterlife. This is one of several model boats made of gold and silver. This miniature boat was found on top of a chariot in the tomb of Queen Ahhotep. It is less detailed than other models, since it has only the oarsmen and the helmsman on board."}
