Among other works attributed to Drost perhaps none is more comparable than the 'Angel leading Lot and his Family out of Sodom' in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris (Benesch C89). Its affinity with a central work for the reconstruction of Drost's drawn oeuvre, the 'Ruth and Naomi' in Bremen (Sumowski 546), has also been noted,[1] the Bremen sheet being the preparatory study for Drost's painting in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. These works have been plausibly dated to the early 1650s, the period to which the British Museum drawing must also belong. The composition is reminiscent of several other works by Rembrandt's followers, in particular the painting of 'Quintus Fabius Maximus' (Bredius 477; present whereabouts unknown, formerly King of Yugoslavia, Belgrade)[2] and the related sketch in Berlin (Benesch 956 recto). There are also analogies with a woodcut of the 'Conversion of Saul' by Christoffel van Sichem, published in various editions in the seventeenth century.[3] The subject of 'Judith's Triumph', like other episodes from the story (Judith 13), was common in Netherlandish art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Like other Old Testament heroes and heroines, she was associated with the liberation of her people from oppression, and parallels were drawn with the struggle of the Dutch Republic against Spain during the Eighty Years' War. A copy of the drawing, from Jonathan Richardson junior's, collection (L.2170) was sold at Christie's, 19 April, 1988, lot 266.[4] NOTES: [1] The attribution to Drost, first made by Pont, 1960, p.212, no.g, was followed with detailed comparisons by Sumowski, 1979 etc., vol.VIII, under no.548x. However, on p.1188, no.2, he rejects the attribution to Drost of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale's drawing of the 'Angel leading Lot and his Family out of Sodom'. [2] The comparison first made by Valentiner, 1925 (see Lit. below). [3] Hollstein 49, from Jan van Moerentorf's 1657 edition of the 'Bible', using plates that had already appeared in 1629, 1646 and 1648. The comparison was first made by van Rijckevorsel, 1932 (see Lit. below). [4] A photograph is in the Museum's files; it contains none of the grey wash in the Museum's own drawing, which was presumably added later.
