{"artifact_name": "bangle", "Object Type": ["bangle"], "Museum number": ["EA40931"], "Description": [" A pair of bangles: one made of silver gilt and one of silver. Each is made from a tube of silver, one with some gilding remaining, folded over and joined on the inner circumference. Each end of the tube has two rings slipped over it. On one bracelet the push-fit end can be seen clearly; one end of the tube is closed and pushed into the open end. Presumably both bracelets were originally gilded.
