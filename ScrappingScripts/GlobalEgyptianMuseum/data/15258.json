The bull stands on a sled, which suggests it was in a shrine in ancient times. Apis is shown with a sun disk decorated with a uraeus, or royal cobra, between its horns. The sun disk and uraeus are the usual symbols of the bull's divine aspect. The facial features, eyes, snout, and ears have been realistically modeled, as have the animal's hooves. With simple outlines, the artist conveyed the strength and power of this divine animal."}
