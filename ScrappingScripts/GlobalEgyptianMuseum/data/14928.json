{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 30858", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DAHSHOUR", "Category": "BELT", "Material": "GOLD; CARNELIAN; LAPIS LAZULI; FELSPAR", "Technique": "INLAID", "Name": "Girdle of Princess Sat-Hathor", "Description": "This girdle of the Princess Sat-Hathor is made of eight gold, half-open cowry shells. The ones at each end have flat reverses, and were joined by means of grooves to serve as a clasp, fastening the girdle when they slid one into the other. The shells are separated from each other by rhomboidal polychrome beads of carnelian, feldspar, and lapis lazuli.Gold cowry shells were imitations of the real cowry shells that had been used in belts, bracelets, anklets, and necklaces since the pre-dynastic period. People thought that cowry shells possessed powerful magical properties and increase female fertility.Princess Sat-Hathor was a daughter of King Senusert the second, and was most probably a sister of Senusert the third, as she was buried within his pyramid complex at Dahshur. Very fine pieces of jewelry that belonged to her were found in her tomb; they are now preserved in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."}
