", " Naukratis provided various scarabs and scaraboids, in glazed composition, Egyptian blue and steatite with a similar inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 83-85; Gorton 1996, 102-103, type XXVIII B, subtype B24-36, see especially B36 for this piece). With this scaraboid made of coloured paste, it would probably fit best in her group XXXIII A. Depending on the identification of the bird, a goose or a duck, its translation can be either a cryptographic reading of the name of Amun-Ra, the goose being a sacred animal to him, or the motto 'Shu, son of Ra' (for both readings: Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). Drioton translated this trigram by Amun (Drioton 1957, 17, no. 5). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88, esp. the type 83 for this piece). Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
