The net is almost rectangular in shape. At the shoulders are short shoulder straps. The yellow tubular beads are arranged in rows at the chest, abdomen, thighs, knees and ankles.The net covered the front of the body from the shoulders to the feet. A scarab has been sewn to the chest. About 10 cm under the scarab are the four amulets of the sons of Horus, in pairs facing each other. The wings and amulets were made of small round beads coloured pale yellow, blue-green and red-brown. The net was found on the mummy of Iru, who still lay in her two painted wooden coffins. The condition of the mummy was very poor due to humidity. The threads of the net had decayed and the amulets had fallen apart and slipped off. Their reconstruction proved to be very difficult."}
