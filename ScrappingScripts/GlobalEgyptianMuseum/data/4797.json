{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "2347", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "OBSIDIAN", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; CARVED", "Width": "1.71 cm", "Depth": "1.08 cm", "Name": "Scarab amulet", "Description": "Mummy scarabs were only used in the funerary cult and probably only from the Late Period onwards. They are special in that they depict a fully worked beetle. The underside is not smooth and inscribed, as with seal scarabs, but shows the legs of the animal. Another important feature is the loop on the underside, which is often not even pierced. The amulet was simply placed on the mummy. There seems to have been no particular material that had to be used. This scarab is made of obsidian."}
