This cone bears the name of the Overseer of the Treasury Djehuty, a high official of Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. His tomb on the West Bank at Thebes (Theban Tomb 11) includes a record of his most important duties, including work on the temple for Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari, and on the temple of Amun at Karnak, on the East Bank. His name was chiselled out on numerous monuments, as if he had fallen from favour at the end of her reign."}
