This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Not certainly from Naukratis. Walter-Karydi (Samos 6.1, 145) suggests that this fragment is from the same vase as a fragment in Boston [86.514] from Naukratis (Fairbanks pl. 34, 319.2; Samos 6.1, 145 no. 950B, the Boston fragment turned 90 degrees), which is plausible. This association would firmly establish the provenience of the Cairo fragment as Naukratis. The two cannot however be from the same side of a pot and cannot join, though clearly from the same workshop.
