{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA579"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Userwer: the surface of this funerary stela, which is almost square in shape, is divided horizontally into three parts.The uppermost division is the largest and contains five lines of text consisting of an offering formula, followed by an appeal to the living who pass by Userwer's monument. Both are intended to provide offerings for the deceased Userwer, whose figure appears in the register below. Here, Userwer and his wife Satdepetnetjer sit facing right, before a table piled high with offerings. A woman called \"his wife Satameni\" stands on the other side of the table, facing Userwer and Satdepetnetjer. On the right, a second seated couple, identified as Userwer's father, Senkhonsu, and his wife, Satnebniut, sit facing left before another table of offerings. On the other side, facing right, a standing male figure, labeled as \"his son Sneferuweser\" offers a leg of beef to Senkhonsu and his wife. The lowest register consists of a row of eight standing figures, all facing right toward Senkhonsu and Satnebniut. They are identified as \"his son, Horuser; his daughter, Satwedja; his daughter, Satseri; his daughter, Imery; his daughter, Ankhyt; his daughter, Satnebniut; his father, Userwer; his male relative Nebniut.\" The stela was never finished. In the bottom register, the last two male figures and the heads and arms of the preceding two female figures were left uncarved. Ruled red lines, forming squared grids on which the figures were sketched out in black ink, can still be seen in the middle and lowest registers where the stone has not been cut away.
