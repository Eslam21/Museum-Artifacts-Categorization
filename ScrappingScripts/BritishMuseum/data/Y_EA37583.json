{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37583"], "Description": [" A terracotta standing monkey, probably an orator, wearing a hooded cloak, his left hand holding its front edge. The right arm is missing and was apparently finished that way, before firing: later a separately made arm would be applied with a plaster adhesive. The long V-shape of the cloak is shown on the back. The feet are damaged. Probably hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with a brown surface. There are traces of an overall white dressing.
