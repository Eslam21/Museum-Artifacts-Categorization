He holds circular objects that were probably symbols used to identify his high rank. Rawer wears a short curly wig and a short kilt. The statue is provided with a pillar to support it from the back. The great skill of the artist during that period is obvious in the magnificent depiction of the facial features and the muscles of the statue, shown in the smallest detail."}
