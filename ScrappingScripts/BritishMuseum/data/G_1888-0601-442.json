Since British Museum 1888,0601.441 was recovered from the Sanctuary of the Dioskouroi, it is likely that 1888,0601.442 was also found there, although the register does not specify this. Beazley suggested that the sherd may belong to a lebes-gamikos. Compare the sherd Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA234, which preserves part of the neck and can hardly be from a dinos. The pieces are illustrated and discussed, without knowledge of the Cambridge sherd, by Hirayama, H. 2010 Kleitias and Attic Black-figure Vases in the Sixth Century B.C., 43, B3 and pl. 32-c-d.
