Amenhotep, son of Hapu, a wise man, earned a great reputation and honor during his lifetime. He was privileged by the king to build his own mortuary temple at the West Bank of Thebes. This statue, along with another portraying him in his young age, were placed inside the temple of the god, Amun-Re, at Karnak to serve as intermediaries between the god and the visitors to the temple. Amenhotep, son of Hapu, was later deified as the god of healing in the Ptolemaic period and a chapel was dedicated to him at Deir el-Bahari temple. The statue depicts him as an aged man, and from the inscription engraved upon it, we learn that he had reached the age of 80 and wished to attain the wise age of 110."}
