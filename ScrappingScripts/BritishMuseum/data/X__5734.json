", " The motif displayed on this scarab does not correspond directly to any known design from the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). It is, however, rather close to Gorton type XXVIII B (Gorton 1996, 101-107). It could represent the divine protection over the pharaoh or be one of the trigrams used to write the name of Amun in a cryptic way (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957).
