They called her Sekhmet, \"the strong one.\"This perfectly sculpted statue depicts the goddess Sekhmet as a woman with the head of a lioness seated on a high cubic chair. The head was originally surmounted by a crown fixed in the hole on top. The features of the lioness are well defined and the mane is sculpted with careful detail. There is also a wig with long lappets hanging on the figure's chest; both hands are placed near the knees, the right hand is flat, and the left is clasped and once held a staff."}
