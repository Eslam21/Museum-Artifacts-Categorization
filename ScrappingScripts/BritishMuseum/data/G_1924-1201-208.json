The cup and kantharos are not typical forms of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Contemporary with the Sphinx and Lion Style is the Mature Animal Style in which cups (but not kantharoi) are more common. Type A kantharoi are contemporary with both styles. Incision is not found on vases of the Mature Animal Style or on Type A kantharoi, but the subject matter and filling ornament on this sherd are very typical of both the Mature Animal Style and that found on Type A kantharoi. This kantharos, one of only a few decorated pieces, appears to be influenced by both styles.
