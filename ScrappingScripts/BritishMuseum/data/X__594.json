", " Similar base forms have been produced in Egypt since the Late Period, see for example 4th and 3rd to 1st century BC parallels (Nenna 2013, Fig. 6.4, T6.4; also Fig. 6.6, T2.8b) . However, the distinctive thick turquoise paste and glaze is more likely Roman, commonly dated 1st to 2nd century AD as on similar ledge rim bowls (Nenna 2013, 129, see T12.3a variant, see also ink pot T22.1b). Similar variants of this form were popular in Hadrianic and late 2nd century AD contexts at Mons Claudianus, probably produced in Memphis (Tomber 2006, type 9; Petrie 1909).
