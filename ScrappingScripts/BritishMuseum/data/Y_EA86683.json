{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86683"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, triangular in section, two flat sides at the rear with impressions of plant material and possibly string, still some dirt remained on the object when it was hardened after excavation. The fine brown Nile clay shows quite some voids of organic particles and some inclusions of mica particles. The front shows two impressions of a scarab-like seal, close to each other, the upper one is preserved almost completely, only the left edge is missing, the lower one is preserved in its right half. The seal impressions show again a bird on the right, facing left, behind it an uraeus. In front of the bird (probably a falcon) two signs over the full height, the first one like a loop (maybe an ankh?), the second one like a standard? Same motif as EA86676.
