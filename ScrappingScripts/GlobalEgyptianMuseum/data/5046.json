{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5093", "Dating": "27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF; CARVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "29.5 cm", "Depth": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Tomb relief", "Description": "Relief with two registers, with the upper part set somewhat back thus creating a small border. The upper break occurs halfway through the first register. A couple is seated on a chair. To their right are a man and an offering table. The man is dressed in a long garment and a panther skin. The lower register depicts a row of people: one man and nine women. Above their heads are vertical columns of hieroglyphs. The layout of the two registers as well as the content of the scenes argues against interpreting this piece as a funerary stela. It may come from a Theban tomb."}
