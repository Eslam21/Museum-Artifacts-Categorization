The sherd ought to belong to the later period of the Wild Goat Style since, although the metopal pattern decoration on the exterior surface is typical of the Wild Goat Style, the lotus decoration on the interior, which is absent during this period, is typical in the later reserved Animal Chalice, Grand and Chalice styles. Furthermore, geese are very rarely portrayed in the Mature Animal Style. The number 652 (?) is written in pencil on the interior."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
