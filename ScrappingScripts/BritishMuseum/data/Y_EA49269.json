Legge worked at nearby Abydos in the same year in which Ayrton and Loat worked in the Predynastic cemetery at Mahasna (see 'Egypt Exploration Fund Arch. Report, 1908-9', 2, 5 ff.). It is noticeable that all excavated examples of tortoise-shell bangles which can be dated firmly to the Predynastic Period are open hoops, often with extensive overlapping of the ends.
