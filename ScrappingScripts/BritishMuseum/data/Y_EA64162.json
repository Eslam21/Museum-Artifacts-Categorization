{"artifact_name": "ear-plug(?); furniture-fitting(?)", "Object Type": [" ear-plug (?) ", " furniture-fitting (?) "], "Museum number": ["EA64162"], "Description": [" Knob for a piece of furniture or ear-plug: in translucent olive-green glass, matt surface, intended for attachment to a piece of furniture. The shape, a circular convex top followed by a central concave area and terminating in another convex area, exactly follows the shape of the hard limestone knobs attached to wooden doors of houses at El-Amarna by means of a bronze nail. The front convex surface is inlaid at its centre with a prefabricated circular band of black and white cord. Within and surrounding this impressed detail small drops of opaque white, orange, black, and turquoise-blue glass have been dropped from the end of a mandril - essentially a spatter technique. The circumferences of the central concave area are outlined with prefabricated white and black cord. At the centre of the under-surface is a cylindrical opening which reaches about halfway up the knob.
