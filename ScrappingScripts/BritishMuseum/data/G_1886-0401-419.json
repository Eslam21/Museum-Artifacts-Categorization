If it does belong to a South Ionian cup with everted rim, then based on the decoration and fabric, it might be placed with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis. Part I., 1884-85 (pl.
