{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE N.Alex.3529", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COIN", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Diameter": "1.500 cm", "Name": "Byzantine Coin of Emperor Phocas", "Description": "The Byzantine bronze coin depicts Phocas who reigned from AD 602 to AD 610. This is an imitation coin. The denomination of the coin is 12 nummia. The front of the coin shows the bust of Phocas facing right. He is wearing a diadem, a military cloak and a breastplate that covers his torso.The reverse side of the coins portrays a cross between the letters \"IB.\" The Greek letters \"IB\" represent the denomination of the coin. The \"I\" stands for 10 and the \"B\" stands for 2 for a total of 12. A 12-nummia series of coins has a barbarous appearance. It is said to be attributed to Phocas who reigned from 23 November AD 602 to 5 October AD 610 and to the mint of Alexandria.This is still under discussion among numismatists, as the legend on the front is an erroneous one. It makes no mention of the Emperor Phocas' name, but mentions Justin or Justinian in particular. J.G. Milne regarded these coins in his, \"Report on the coins found at Antinoe in AD 1914, Numismatic Chronicle AD 1947, pp. 108-114,\" as having been struck elsewhere than at an Imperial mint.Milne believes that when officials in the countryside could not get supplies of coin from Alexandria, they might have struck coins with dies copied from any coins that were at hand, whether of the reigning emperor or his predecessors."}
