On top of the fragment is a circular shallow recess and partial remains of another recess with a straight edge. The front edge is smoothed, while the left side contains a partial horizontal line of incised text. The remaining two sides are heavily damaged with no surviving inscription, and the corners of the stone are also chipped. On the base of the fragment, \u2018Tell Amarna\u2019 is written in red ink.
