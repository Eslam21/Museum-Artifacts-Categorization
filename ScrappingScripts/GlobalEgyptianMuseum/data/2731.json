{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "E72:105", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; POLISHED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "28 cm", "Width": "9.5 cm", "Depth": "20 cm", "Name": "Statue of Senemiah", "Description": "A fine example of the sculpture produced during the period of reunification at the end of the 2nd Intermediate Period, when the kings at Thebes succeeded in expelling the Hyksos, foreign kings ruling northern Egypt. The sculpting of the figure is confident, and the hieroglyphs are clearly formed and cleanly incised. The inscription on the sides identifies the man as Senemiah, a priest of the Theban moon-god Khons, with the unusual phrase 'he whose hands are pure when adorning his god', referring to the daily ritual in which the image of the god was given fresh food and clothing. This type of statue was placed in tombs, and this example is inscribed with the formula requesting a share in the offerings made by the king to the gods."}
