The stamp of Lucus Eumachius is of a well-known Pompeii family who had wine producing estates in the region (Bezeczky 2010). Lucus Eumachius was operating from 43 to 1BC (if not already before) and is well attested in the Pompeii region (CIL X 8042.47a-b, 47d-f, 47h-i, 47k-s). His wine amphorae have been found in Ephesus and also lost in the wreck Le Grand Ribaud D, near Toulon, in c. 10-1BC. Lucius was survived by his daughter Eumachia, a public priestess, who following the death of her husband inherited the estate in 1 or 2 AD (CIL X 810, CIL X 811, CIL X 813). The wealth of her estate enabled a public building programme, that included the portico for the colonnade of the forum in Pompeii, that possibly enabled her son's (Marcus Numistrius Fronto) entry into local politics. She was buried outside Pompeii at the Porta di Nocera (D\u2019Ambrosio & De Caro 1983, 11OS). For a prosopography see (Nonnis 2015, 212-3). This form of amphora were widely distributed across the Roman Empire and beyond, reaching England and India. Concerning the early adoption of this Koan (Greek) wine amphora form in Roman Italy see Iavarone (2013, on L.Eumachius see 233-4).
