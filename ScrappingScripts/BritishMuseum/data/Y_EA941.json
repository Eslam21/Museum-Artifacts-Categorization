{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA941"], "Description": [" Fragmentary calcite statue of the king Ptolemy II with the right arm and shoulder restored, the left side and lower body now lost. The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth with a single uraeus, with the head and coiled body of the cobra displayed at the centre above the king\u2019s forehead. There appears to be another wig or headdress visible underneath the lappets of the nemes which is set low against the forehead, and at the ends of the cloth where another layer of stone is clearly indicated. On the reverse, the headdress tapers into a pointed end in low relief. The right arm is held across the chest with the thumb resting against the index finger, though there is no item depicted in the clenched hand. The left arm appears to be placed by the king\u2019s side, and thus he may have originally been depicted in a seated or standing position. The face is rounded, with narrow almond shaped eyes and modelled eyebrows which are indicated in a straight line across the brow. The nose is broad, and the thick lips are curved into a subtle smile. At the chin, the king wears a long stylised false beard. On the reverse are the remains of the upper section of a broad back-pillar which is uninscribed. In addition to the loss of the right shoulder and arm, there is further damage to the king\u2019s beard, chin and left side of the nemes headcloth as well as the uraeus cobra. The ears of the statue are possibly unfinished, with a channel of potentially unworked(?) stone visible behind the lobes.

The atypical choice of stone for the sculpture is also noteworthy. Roughly of life-sized height and composition, other hypotheses have suggested that the statue was a representation of Nectanebo II (Josephson 1997), however it is now generally agreed that the surviving features are consistent with other surviving images of Ptolemy II. Archaising artistic tendencies are typical of statues from the Late Period onwards, which harken back to the appearance and style of monuments from the Old Kingdom; it has been proposed that this statue of Ptolemy II is directly influenced by the images of the 3rd Dynasty king Djoser (Baines and Riggs 2001), though others have argued against this suggestion (Ashton 2003). Though the provenance of the statue is unknown, Saqqara has been tentatively suggested as a possible context (Baines and Riggs; Taylor 2008; and noted as possible within Strudwick 2006).
