The eye is an opaque black disc outlined in orange. The conventionalized markings always present on the head of this bird, here in dark-blue glass, are separated by a small slice of banded mosaic glass. The companion piece, facing left, is in Cairo (32122). Both examples are probably the terminals of a 'wesekh' collar.
