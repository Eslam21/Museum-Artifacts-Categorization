A collar was once placed about the neck. The figure is painted black, symbolic of rebirth and regeneration, a colour not characteristic of jackals in nature.The cult of Anubis was well established before it was assimilated into the cult of Osiris in the 6th Dynasty. Anubis was said to have embalmed Osiris after his murder at the hands of Seth, thereby strengthening an existing association with the process of mummification."}
