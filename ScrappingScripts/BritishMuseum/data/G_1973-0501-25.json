{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.19"], "Description": [" Terracotta reclining ithyphallic figure, possibly Harpocrates. A man reclining on a plain rectangular plinth, modelled in the round, his legs extended to his right, the left leg on the ground, the right knee raised. He rests his left arm on a block and his right hand on the root of his large phallus, the glans of which lies between his feet. He wears a short chlamys, the ends round his throat and falling behind him. Solid; two-piece mould, with cut-outs made subsequent to moulding emphasizing his arms and his right leg. Buff to red marl clay with a little mica. Some colours remain, mostly painted over a white dressing: the flesh is pink, the top of the plinth was probably left white, and there may be some red paint on the block.
