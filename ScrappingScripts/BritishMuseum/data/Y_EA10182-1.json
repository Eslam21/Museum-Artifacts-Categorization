Known as 'The Teaching of Amenemhat' for his son Sesostris, it records a historical event which took place at the end of the reign of the 12th Dynasty's founder in about 1955 BC, couched in a literary form. The text suggests that Amenemhat was assassinated and the dead king warns his successor to trust no one lest he too be betrayed. It is clear the teacher occasionally found faults with his pupils hand; the signs written in the upper margin are the teacher's corrected forms of signs imperfectly copied by the scribe. As is typical of literary texts in hieratic, some groups of signs are written in red ink to indicate section or chapter headings. Also characteristic are the superscript dots called verse points, used to indicate the ends of lines. A colophon at the end of the poem names the teacher Qageb to whom the copyist Inena dedicated the manuscript. ", " Published: Bourriau, Pharaohs and Mortals, no. 61 F.
