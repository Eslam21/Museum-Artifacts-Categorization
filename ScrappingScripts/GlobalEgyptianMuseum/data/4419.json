{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M13661", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "INCISED", "Height": "69 cm", "Width": "38.5 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "A limestone round-topped stela belonging to Senen, which was unfortunately destroyed in 1941. It is of particular interest as it gives the names of the parents of Senebi, whose stela (see number M13635) was also in the collection and lost at the same time.The decoration is on one side only and is enclosed in an incised single line border. In the arch are two standing jackals and between them is the single line of hieroglyphs, naming the god, Wepwawet. To the left is a symbol of Upper Egypt and to the right a symbol of the Delta. Below are six horizontal bands of text, a htp-dj-nsw formula (see 'Hieroglyphs'). Below this inscription are two further columns, again consisting of the htp-dj-nsw formula, which separate two standing male figures. Both wear ankle-length kilts, broad collars and shoulder length wigs. The workmanship on this stela is not as fine as that of it's companion piece, no great care appears to have been taken with details."}
