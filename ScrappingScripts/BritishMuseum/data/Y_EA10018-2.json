", " The scene of auto fellatio is a variant on the usual scene of the cosmos as Nut and Geb (seen on the right of the frame); here however, specifically the night sky seems to be represented, and as a male who is identified as \u2018Osiris Foremost of Westerners, maker of heaven, maker of earth, maker of the netherworld \u2026\u2019. The other figure is identified as \u2018Geb father of the gods, the great god who made the earth and all that the sun encircles\u2019. The fact that Osiris is ithyphallic presumably refers to the fact he is potent and resurrected, while Geb\u2019s autofellatio is presumably a way of representing him as self-sustaining fertile \u2013 like the masturbating creator god: although alone, he is still capable of creation. The motif of Geb\u2019s posture (but not the sex act) is paralleled in other scenes, which show the deity as androgynous to indicate fertility (see O. Kaper, The Astronomical Ceiling of Deir el-Haggar), Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 81 (1995), p. 179-82. Geb's aroused state is paralleled in other mythological papyri where is rising towards Nut. ", " A possible parallel is a scene on the coffin of Ast-em-kheb (CCG 61031) where Geb is curled up underneath a female Nut. The photograph in Daressy 1909, pl. 52 is too small to be clear, but it looks as if Geb might have an an erect phallus also there.
