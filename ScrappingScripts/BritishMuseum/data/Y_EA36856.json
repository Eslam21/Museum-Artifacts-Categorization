IV, 1971, 401, 2) particularly typical of the Ptolemaic period (Yoyotte 1994-95, 674). Petrie mentioned this basin in his diary: 'A very interesting find made lately in the later period (Roman) chambers built inside the temenos wall, is a fragment of a black basalt bowl some 2 or 3 feet diam[eter] & 3 or 4 in[che]s deep. Bes standing on the outer face, & a line of demotic, & on the top edge the feet of a standing figure: another fragment with more demotic was found later on.' (Petrie diary 1884-1885, p. 97-98). The dedication is made in honour of the main Egyptian god revered in Naukratis, Amun-Ra Baded. The representation of Bes is rare on sha-basin, usually of a Hathor head. Found to the north side of the Great Temenos (\u201cinner side of north wall\u201d) On this sha-basin, see: Petrie 1886, 34, pl. XXXVI, 6; Gardner 1888, 81, pl.
