{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA68002"], "Description": [" Limestone panel: both sides of the panel have been covered with a grid, drawn in ink. At the far left of one side has been drawn the figure of a woman who stands facing right, holding an 'ankh' sign and the papyrus scepter of a goddess. Though now much faded, the drawing was very well executed. She has a Hellenistic-looking profile. Her position at the far left of the space suggests that she was meant to be part of a larger composition. The deity is given the dominant rightward-facing orientation, while her royal audience would have occupied the secondary position, facing left. The other side of the panel has a barely visible representation of a king.
