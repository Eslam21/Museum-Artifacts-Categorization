", " This rather simple version of a double spouted lamp is probably late Roman (4th century AD) in date, though similar 4th century AD examples don't have the handle (see Bailey 1988, British Museum Lamps III, Q2143, GR1982, 0302.33). More ornate, but earlier, Roman lamps with the handle are dated to the late 1st century AD (Bailey 1988, Q1873, Q1874, Q1919, Q1920, GR1987,0401.4, GR1987,0402.26, GR1866, 0415.55, GR1866,0415.54).
