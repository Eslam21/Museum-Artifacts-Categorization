Lower half of figure in high relief of woman dancing to front with right foot ponting out to viewer, and now removed by abrasion, with left foot kicked up; wearing long chiton, its pleats falling away from central fold, which appears to fall from under an Isis knot; hem? selvedge(?) indicated on right with short horizontal lines, or this feature could indicate an Egyptianised fringed mantle. Base line below figure modelled as projecting ridge, with a glazed area below this appearing to have more modelled features, which are unfortunately impossible to distinguish.. Glaze- thick, blue-green similar to other Ptolemaic frags, no secondary colouring. Core- yellowish, red to white, very fine, medium hard. Inside roughly finished, although glazed, with some deep porosities.

The edging at right side may belong to an Egyptianised fringed mantel as seen in the Queen's dress in Thompson Ptolemaic Oinochoai, 1973, no.123. This dancing figure might be related to a Dionysiac scene, as suggested by Thompson for the relief fragment with goat, Thompson no. 269.
