He is holding the composite scepter, the insignia of kingship that symbolized prosperity and stability. This statue shows Khonsu as a youth with the side lock of hair. Khonsu's facial features resemble those of Tutankhamun. This statue also identifies Khonsu with Ptah. This might explain why there are scenes of the worship of Ptah inside the Chapel of Khonsu in the great open court of the Temple of Amun at Karnak."}
