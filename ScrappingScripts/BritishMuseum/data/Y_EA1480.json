Above his figure is a short enumeration of the basic funerary food- and drink-offerings. The greatest part of the panel is occupied by a very full offering-list containing 90 entries, arranged in three horizontal rows. The whole is cut in fair, low relief. In the past the surface has weathered badly. The stone now is fairly tough. No colour remains.

The style and layout of the inscribed area are more characteristic of provincial than Memphite work; likewise, Iny's principal title suggests that his base of operations was in Upper Egypt.
