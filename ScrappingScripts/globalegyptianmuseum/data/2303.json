{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:276", "Dating": "2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "INCISED; CARVED", "Height": "0.6 cm", "Width": "0.8 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs. This example has a crudely incised back, and on the underside a carefully cut motif of symmetrically arranged hieroglyphs taken from royal titles and epithets. Such hieroglyph groupings are typical of the 2nd Intermediate Period, when the north of Egypt was ruled by foreign kings, the Hyksos. The signs do not form a connected text, but seem to be used for the inherent protective power of the sacred script."}
