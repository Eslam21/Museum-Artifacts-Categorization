{"artifact_name": "jar-label", "Object Type": ["jar-label"], "Museum number": ["EA35518"], "Description": [" Four fragments of an ebony label: joining to form two larger pieces. One side of the label is inscribed, and there was a perforation at the top right-hand corner for attachment. The upper part bears the remains of the incised serekh of A\u1e25a, opposite a scene showing boats and a religious sanctuary, perhaps Temple of Neith at Sais. On the lower fragments are traces of another religious building, a row of boats and place names and the name of the type of oil to which the label referred, together with its quantity.
