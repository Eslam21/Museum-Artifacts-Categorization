{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86764"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression, about the half preserved. The fine brown Nile clay with some mica inclusions was hardened after excavation. The rear shows one side with two small coils of basketry and a second side with remains of one coil of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows half of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal with a circumferential line. At the left a small standing falcon with a sun-disc above the head, facing to the left, behind it a much taller seated animal like a Seth-animal or a jackal, the part of the ears is not preserved.
