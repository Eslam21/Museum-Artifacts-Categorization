This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype B1-17, see especially B16 for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122). This type of representation can be paralleled to Archaic Greek gems, with single oval line incised round edge (e.g. Walters 1926, pl. VIII, no. 450; see also H\u00f6lbl 1979, pl. 77, no. 263 for similar frame and opposed animals).
