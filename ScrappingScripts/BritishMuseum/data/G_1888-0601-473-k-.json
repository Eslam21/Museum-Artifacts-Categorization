The sherd ought to belong to the later period of the Wild Goat Style since the metopal pattern decoration on the exterior surface is typical of the Wild Goat Style but the lotus decoration on the interior, which is absent during this period, is typical in the later reserved Animal Chalice, Grand and Chalice styles. The curvature of the sherd appears somewhat steep for a chalice and so this vessel may be a kantharos instead. For parallels, see the Type A kantharos in Williams 1983, 171, fig. 12, no. 58.
