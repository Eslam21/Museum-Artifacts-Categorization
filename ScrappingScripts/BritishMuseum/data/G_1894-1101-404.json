Clerc et al. 1976 discuss contextualised examples from cultic contexts in Kition. Forgeau (171-6) and Lagarce (in Clerc et al. 1976, 167-74) provide useful overviews of the use and significance of scarabs (along with other Egyptianizing amulets) on Cyprus which often differ from those found in Egyptian contexts.
