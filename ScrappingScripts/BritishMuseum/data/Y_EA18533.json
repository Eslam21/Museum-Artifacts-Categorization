According to Gorton, this scarab\u2019s type was probably not produced at the Scarab Factory in Naukratis as it appears in an early 7th century BC context (tomb 16 from Carthage, Dermech: see Vercoutter 1945, no. 379) and as the name Menkara refers to a 25th dynasty prince (Gorton 1996, 80, 88). However, several scarabs found, and possibly produced at Naukratis, present this name of Menkara: in such context, Menkara would represent a motto 'Stable is the Ka of Ra', rather than the name of a 25th dynasty vassal (Masson 2017). A 26th dynasty date should, therefore, be considered for that scarab from Tell Nabasha. For a similar style of decoration and shape of scarab, see BM EA66506 from Naukratis (Gorton 1996, 86-87, type XXVI A1). Gorton, A.
