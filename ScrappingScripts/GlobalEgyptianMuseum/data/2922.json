{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:73", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "JUG", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "13.5 cm", "Width": "9 cm", "Name": "Cypriot base-ring jug", "Description": "Footed jug with globular lower body, tall neck ending in funnel-shaped mouth, with a handle from the applied band at the upper neck to the globular body shoulder. The surface has been covered with a black slip and burnished. The vessel appears to have been hand-made, rather than thrown on the potter's wheel. Such base-ring jugs have been found in numerous mid- to late 18th Dynasty burials in Egypt, but they were mainly imported from Cyprus. The distinctive shape has been compared to the seed pod of the opium poppy, and, though the drug opium may not have been possible to refine at this early date, it is possible that the jugs were used in an international trade in some cosmetic or medicinal oil involving the plant."}
