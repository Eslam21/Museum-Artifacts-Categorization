{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1881:2917", "Dating": "MODERN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "10.5 cm", "Width": "0.7 cm", "Name": "Shabti", "Description": "Bronze shabti figure with chipped base. The form is typical of finely modelled Late Period shabtis. Bronze shabtis have occasionally been found in excavation, but they were also cast from faience originals in the 18th and 19th centuries. Such modern castings provided a means of delivering a reliable copy in the days before accurate reproduction in print (the earliest lithography dates to 1798). Modern metal versions of faience objects are therefore not 'fakes', but an important early chapter in European study of the past."}
