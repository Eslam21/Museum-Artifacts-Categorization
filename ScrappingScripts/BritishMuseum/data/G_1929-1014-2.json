{"artifact_name": "lantern", "Object Type": ["lantern"], "Museum number": ["1929,1014.2"], "Description": [" Mould-made pottery lantern with a cylindrical body with a domed top above a moulding, surmounted by a pierced lug. The lantern stands on a circular plinth with a moulded top; the base is concave below. On each side is a flaming torch, and on the front is a helmeted head (possibly Athena), within a shrine consisting of an architrave supported by two columns. Four triangular cut-outs separate the head from the shrine. At the back is an arched opening, for the combustible substance or a small lamp. The drab red-brown surface is perhaps a slip.
