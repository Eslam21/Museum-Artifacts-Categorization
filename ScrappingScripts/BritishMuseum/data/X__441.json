", " Described as a jackal bronze figure in the EEF inventory of objects sent to Boston in 1885, but is clearly a cat figure. Among the finds from the cache of bronzes, Petrie listed four bronze figures of cats (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41- 42; Masson forthcoming a). One of them correspond to this figure (same measurement as given by Petrie) which was discovered during the first season of excavation at Naukratis. The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). Cats are usually associated with the goddess Bastet, a deity particularly revered in Lower Egypt (Kessler 1989, 150-154). Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming b). This partially preserved specimen belongs to the type T 32 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 783-791, Pl. 49, Typ T 32), or maybe to her type T 33 (Weiss 2012, 792, Pl. 50a, Typ T 33). The former type is particularly common in Bubastis, the main cult centre of the goddess, but also on many sites of the Delta, such as Herakleion, the Memphite region and Tanis (Weiss 2012, 297-298).
