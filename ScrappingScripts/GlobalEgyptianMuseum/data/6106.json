{"Present location": "INSTITUT DE PAPYROLOGIE ET D'\u00c9GYPTOLOGIE, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LILLE III [02/049] LILLE", "Inventory number": "L 1299", "Dating": "CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "AKSHA/SERRA WEST", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "43.6 cm", "Diameter": "23,5 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Deep and narrow jar with marked shoulder, small neck, thick lip and rounded conical base. Though no slip was applied, its colour varies from light red to dark pink. The surface is irregular and uneven but has been polished, which left many traces - diagonal ones in the upper section, vertical ones in the lower section. The body is asymmetrical and the collar is misshapen. On the external surface, there is an incised X motif near the base and there are two horizontal incisions on the collar. Like many others, this vessel, which was found in an A-Group tomb, demonstrates the importance of the trade between Upper and Lower Nubia towards the end of the Predynastic period in Egypt. Vessels of this type, called ''wine jars'' by researchers, were used by the Egyptians to transport food products to Nubia. They were thereafter used by Nubians, who appreciated the technical qualities of the vessels and did not hesitate to place them in their tombs."}
