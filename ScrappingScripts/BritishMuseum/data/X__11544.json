Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. This type evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape.
