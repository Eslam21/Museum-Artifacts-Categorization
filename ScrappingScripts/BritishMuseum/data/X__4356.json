", " The hieroglyphic inscription on its underside is rather difficult to understand. It has been translated by \"Offering to Kheper, libation to Horus\" in EEF distribution list. The hieroglyphs, however, could have been only used for their magical value, as often for Naukratis scarabs (Gorton 1996, 93). This scarab is not listed in Gorton's typology, but it could belong to her type XXXI, a type often found on Punic sites though not exclusively (Gorton 1996, 103-107). The size of the scarab, the technique and the motif fit with the type. However, this type is usually made of coloured paste, not glazed composition.
