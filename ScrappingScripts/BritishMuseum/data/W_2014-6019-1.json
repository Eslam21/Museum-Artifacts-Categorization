In 1971 he graduated from Louisiana State University, USA with a degree in Fine Arts, gaining a master\u2019s degree from Yale University in 1973. Although his studies focused on Western abstract painting, Nahas takes his inspiration from a diverse range of influences, most significantly from nature and occasionally from Islamic art, in particular its abstract geometric and colourful qualities. He is best known for his series of thickly encrusted starfish and fractal (never-ending patterns) paintings, built up of layers of acrylic paint mixed with pumice and finished in vivid colours. He is also famous for his expressive landscapes of cedars, olive trees and palms, which reconnect him to the places of his childhood in the Lebanon and Egypt. In July 2013 he was awarded the honour of the National Order of the Cedar for services to Lebanese culture. He divides his time between New York and Beirut.
