Their form is extremely schematised, and their heads tend to resemble that of a bird. The arms are raised beside the head with the palms of the hands turned to face inward, and the upper part of the body leans forward slightly. At the bottom of the legs is the hint of a foot. Their function in a tomb is not immediately apparent; are they bird-headed deities, fertility goddesses, concubines for the deceased, mourners, or even dancers?"}
