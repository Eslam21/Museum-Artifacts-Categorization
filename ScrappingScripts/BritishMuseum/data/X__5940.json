", " Findspot and find-year recorded on Philadelphia register card. Possibly one of the six scarabs from the Scarab Factory mentioned in the EEF distribution list Philadelphia under no. 38. This scarab, produced in the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming), belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially found in Carthage, Cumae and Perachora (Gorton 1996, 114-117, type XXXII, subtype A2-27a, see especially A2 for this piece). Gorton interprets the motif on the underside as orientalising and representing quatrefoil leaves separated by four tendrils (Gorton 1996, 114). However, the cross pattern motif was very popular on Egyptian scarabs already in the Middle Kingdom (see for example: Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 353, n\u00b0829; Matouk 1977, 408, n\u00b02215-2222; Giveon 1988, n\u00b010; Ben-Tor 2007, pl. 12, n\u00b044). By the Late Period, it became an archaising motif for scarabs (Magnarini 2004, n\u00b005.01, n\u00b005.03-05; Masson forthcoming).
