{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA55254"], "Description": [" Grey basalt theophorous statue of Wennefer holding a figure of the deity Khonspakherd. Wennefer adopts a striding position with the left leg advancing forward ahead of the right leg. He wears a smooth shoulder-length \u2018bag wig\u2019, a common style associated with the 26th Dynasty. His eyes are narrow and almond shaped, with faintly ridged eyebrows and a slim nose that broadens out at the nostrils. The face is particularly rounded at the cheeks and jawline. He wears a version of the long \u2018Persian wrap\u2019 garment, with a strap over the left shoulder, a knot of material tied across the chest, and a further strip of material down the right side of the statue\u2019s torso resembling the \u1ec9m\u021d\u1e2b sign. Wennefer\u2019s garment is inscribed with three columns of text which are undefined by a border, beginning underneath the deity\u2019s base and reaching towards the edges of the clothing. A short line of text is also inscribed across both of his upper arms, and two lines of inscription continue across the top of the statue base next to Wennefer\u2019s feet, oriented towards the living viewer. On the reverse, the slim back-pillar is inscribed with two columns of hieroglyphic text. Wennefer holds a small base which supports the standing image of the deity Khonspakherd, the child form of the Theban god Khonsu. He is depicted in a mummified form with the traditional sidelock of hair conveying youth, and he holds a was-scepter clasped to his chest. His crown includes a uraeus cobra at the forehead, and the crown depicts the two phases of the moon (a full moon disc and a crescent moon). There are numerous small chips and scratches to the stone surface across the figure\u2019s wig, neck, and chest, as well as to the clothing on either side of the deity\u2019s image and his base. There are also various chips to the statue base around Wennefer\u2019s feet and the front edge, as well as the edges of the back pillar and ridge between the clothing and the back pillar on both sides of the statue.

While the deities evoked on the text from his upper arms \u2018\u1e24r-mn of Isw.t\u2019 and \u2018Iw.t-nfr.t\u2019 are obscure (Klotz 2009), others mentioned as part of Wennefer\u2019s list of titles include the more familiar Horus of Hierakonpolis and Bastet of Thebes, and he also addresses the wab priests of Nun. The statue has previously been recorded as being found within the chapel of Hatshepsut in Thebes (PM II); additionally the inscription upon Wennefer\u2019s clothing addresses the priests from the Akhmenu at Karnak, which may indicate that the statue\u2019s original \u2013 at least intended \u2013 context was Karnak temple (Klotz 2009). This hypothesis is also supported by the close textual parallels to a surviving Ptolemaic statue from the Karnak cachette (CG 42277, now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (MMA 07.228.28): https://www.ifao.egnet.net/bases/cachette/ck802). The potential parallel to Ptolemaic inscriptions, and Wennefer\u2019s stylistic features, have also led to revisions of the statue\u2019s proposed date to the Ptolemaic Period (Klotz 2009). A Theban origin also seems likely given the references to Theban deities, the priests within the Akhmenu, and Wennefer\u2019s listed titles including the \u2018servant of the White Crown\u2019. The principal cult centre of Khonsu-the-Child has been suggested to be Temple A of the Mut temple (Klotz 2009). Further Bibliography: S. Albersmeier, 2002.
