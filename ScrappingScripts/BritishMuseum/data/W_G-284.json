One of their greatest artistic achievements was the glorious pottery of Iznik, a centre of ceramic production established in the 1480s that continued for over 200 years. Over time, Iznik potters introduced different shapes, styles and colours, culminating in the 1550s with a brilliant red and a range of floral motifs, including the tulip, whose introduction to Europe led to \u2018Tulipomania.\u2019 The Ottoman elite, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, all commissioned and consumed products such as Iznik ceramics. The Armenian inscription on the base of this ewer commemorates \u2018Abraham, servant of God, of K\u00fctahya.\u2019 K\u00fctahya was a thriving town under the Ottomans, with many Armenian Christians residing there. The date 959 is in the Armenian calendar equivalent to 1510 AD. Labels: Case No ... Ewer Godman; Godman; 35.
