{"artifact_name": "stopper; plug; seal-impression; amphora", "Object Type": [" stopper ", " plug ", " seal-impression ", " amphora "], "Museum number": ["EA53957"], "Description": [" Yellow plaster stopper still in the neck of an Egyptian wine amphora with a Nile silt pottery disc plug. The stopper has been impressed with a circular stamp and then painted red (only traces remain). The stamp impression depicts a cross (21mm across) surrounded with Greek text. The stopper is made from lime plaster or lime plaster and gypsum mix. There is a mark where a string was unsuccessfully used for removal. The black sealant around the amphora neck and the underside of the plug is probably pine pitch.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1 & 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1 & 7). The black sealant around the amphora neck and the underside of the plug is probably pine pitch, confirming that this is a wine amphora stopper (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006 type 1). The plug is from a chocolate brown Nile-silt LRA7, just like the amphora in which this still sits (Keay and Williams 2005: LRA7). Cf., stoppers from late Roman contexts at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.3\u20136) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, fig. 10). For the cross stamp, cf., impressions from Western Thebes (Winlock and Crum, 80, fig. 33.1\u20132). The motif is common on Late Roman amphora stoppers in Egypt, e.g., at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.3\u20137) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, fig. 10). For the stamp itself, cf. a similar, simple circular cross on a wooden stamp without text found at Koptos (Nachtergael 2000, 289, fig. 23). See also EA 53951. The alignment of the text suggests \u03a9\u0397\u039d\u0391 + \u0392\u039f\u0397\u0399 as a possible reading, but it does not appear to represent any attested name or prayer formula, suggesting a misreading or another, unclear message.
