{"artifact_name": "polisher", "Object Type": ["polisher"], "Museum number": ["EA86141"], "Description": [" Flat polisher made of white quartz in an oval ground shape. Both sides well smoothed with one side a bit better furnished. The upper- and underside are slightly convex, forming a lentoid section. Therefore a use as a palette doesn\u2019t seem plausible, possible use as a polisher or other tool. On the edge several wear marks from a usage like hammering.
