Petrie illustrates a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45). This type was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, see especially A73-88 for this piece). However, this seal impression indicates that the scarabs at the Scarab Factory were not exclusively produced for export, but could have to some extent a local use. Petrie, W.M.F. 1886, Naukratis.
