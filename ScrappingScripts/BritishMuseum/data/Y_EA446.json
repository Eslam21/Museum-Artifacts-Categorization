{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA446"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Huy: a partially preserved stela bearing the remains of a scene carved in sunk relief on its upper edge, and below it five horizontal lines of incised hieroglyphs. The scene appears to be divided into two sections, one on the left and one on the right. On the left a male figure stands before four figures seated in chairs whose legs end in lion's paws and behind whom stands a female figure. On the right a female figure appears to stand before six figures seated on similar chairs. The text consists of a prayer to Osiris, Ptah-Sokar, Hathor, Horus, Amenhotep I and Ahmose-Nerfertari on behalf of the workman Huy, son of Sb\u0292; and Nfrt-\u1ec9\u1ec9.t\u1ec9. His wife T\u0292\u1e2b\u0292r and his daughter Dw\u0292-m-mr.st are also named. The six figures on the right of the scene can probably be identified with the above-named deities. There are two gouges in the centre and on the right edge which is worn and partly broken away. There are no traces of colour.
