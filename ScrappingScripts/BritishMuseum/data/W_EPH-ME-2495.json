The message reads: \"Day Five. Apart from the museum, they have an amazing research library here, known as the Rakow, with free photocopying & scanning facilities. Discovered a copy of a 1964 Japanese exhib. catalogue of treasures from the Kabul museum which I've previously failed to track down but which has photos of pieces since stolen. And they have a buzzing studio full of individuals, children & artists making glass objects or vessels. We had a demo yesterday by one of the world's leading glass artists, who presented a huge vessel afterwards to the museum in David's memory\". The sender was at a conference in Corning at the time.
