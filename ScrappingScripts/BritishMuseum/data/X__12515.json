", " The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic features and the absence of decoration on the interior and exterior surfaces make it impossible to determine whether it comes from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two white bands.
