{"artifact_name": "counter", "Object Type": ["counter"], "Museum number": ["1974,1009.99"], "Description": [" Bone counter with a female portrait: part of the right side has broken away and been repaired. A piece is missing from the bottom of this disc. This counter has a bluish tinge. It bears a female head in profile, wearing the Hellenistic royal diadem. The woman has her hair arranged into corkscrew locks that fall in three tiers. Her eye is large with sharply defined eyelids, the nose long and pointed with a curling nostril, the upper lip thin but the lower lip fuller, and the chin small and pointed. The cheek is full. On the reverse are inscribed the numeral IIII, the letters CIC (SIS), and an illegible character. The inscription suggests that Isis is the subject.
