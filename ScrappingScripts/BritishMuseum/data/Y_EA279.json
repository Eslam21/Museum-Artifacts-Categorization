{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA279"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Sementawy: there are two scenes in sunk relief with incised texts on this round-topped stela. In the upper register Sementawy, the guardian of the Place of Truth, kneels in adoration on the right, holding a brazier in one hand, before Amun-Re\u2018 and Mut enthroned on the left. In the lower register the goddess Meresger is enthroned on the left behind an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus flower. The fan-bearer 'It-n-\u1ec9t.f and his wife, the lady Nfr, kneel in adoration on the right. A column of text between the two figures names her(?) sister T\u0292-'Iwnw, whose relationship is obscure. There are some gouges and scratches on the surface. The lower corners are slightly damaged. There are traces of red paint along the outlines of the figures, thrones and altars, and in the dividing lines between the columns of hieroglyphs.

However, an inscribed fragment from Deir el-Medina names a Sementawy as the son of the lady Meresger described as the daughter of a Wadjrenpet (B. Bruy\u00e8re, \u2018Rapport sur les fouilles de Deir el M\u00e8dineh\u2019 (Cairo, 1948-51), 38). Now a Meresger is attested as the wife of the guardian Amenemone and the mother of the guardian Kenherkhepeshef who flourished at the beginning of the reign of Ramses II (J. \u010cerny, \u2018A Community of Workmen at Thebes in the Ramesside Period\u2019 (Cairo, 1973), 155). There is also a Wadjrenpet in the family, but that is the name of Amenemone's mother and so Meresger's mother-in-law. For the two Meresgers to be identical, the inscription would have to be interpreted as either a reference to Wadjrenpet as mother(-in-law) of Meresger or possibly as a mistake for daughter Wadjrenpet, the granddaughter being named after her grandmother. It would be highly unlikely for Meresger to have had a mother and a mother-in-law both named Wadjrenpet. Thus there is a possibility that the guardian flourished under Ramses II. However, a Sementawy is also attested at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty or early in the Twentieth Dynasty and he could be the guardian (J. \u010cerny, \u2018A Community of Workmen at Thebes in the Ramesside Period\u2019 (Cairo, 1973), 158).
