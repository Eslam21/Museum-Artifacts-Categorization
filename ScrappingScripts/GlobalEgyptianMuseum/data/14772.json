{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 33176", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Name": "Shawabti Statuette in a Small Model Coffin", "Description": "A small, mummiform Shawabti figure is in a model coffin of limestone. The deceased's mummiform figure is shown on the lid wearing a long wig that leaves the ears free. His eyes and eyelids are painted in black; he is wearing a very wide collar that covers his chest. The Ba bird, symbol of his soul, with its wings outstretched, hovers over the body to help in the resurrection process, in which the soul returns to the corpse. It was hoped that the statuette inside the coffin would act as a substitute for the deceased and thus receive protection. Thus, the Shawabti would be preserved from decay and be kept alive eternally to serve the deceased in the afterlife."}
