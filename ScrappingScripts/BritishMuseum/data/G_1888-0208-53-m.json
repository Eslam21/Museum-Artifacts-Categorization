Most, or possibly all, of the 14 fragments today registered under this number were thus found in the Qasr, chamber 29. The two fragments that come last in the registration sequence (m and n) and were re-registered in 1924 may be least likely to belong to the original dozen. Another fragment possibly from this vessel is Philadelphia E.157.11: it comes from Tell Dafana and has crescents above the zigzag.
