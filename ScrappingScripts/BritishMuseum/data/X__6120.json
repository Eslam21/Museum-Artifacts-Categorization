", " Cats are usually associated with the goddess Bastet, a deity particularly revered in Lower Egypt (Kessler 1989, 150-154). Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). This specimen belongs to the type T 32 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 783-791, Pl. 49, Typ T 32, see especially Nr. 1002 for this specimen). This type is particularly common in Bubastis, the main cult centre of the goddess, but also on many sites of the Delta, such as Herakleion, the Memphite region and Tanis (Weiss 2012, 297-298).
