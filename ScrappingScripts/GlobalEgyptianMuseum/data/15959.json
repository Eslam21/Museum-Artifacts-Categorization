The vessel has a lightly molded rim, from which the sides taper to a plane base.It is decorated with gilded figures of Cupids producing wine and Dionysos drinking the fruit of their labors. On one side, three Cupids pluck grapes from the vine while trampling the fallen fruit in a vat. The resulting liquid flows from a spout, which is now lost, into a mixing bowl held by two Cupids. On the opposite side, Dionysos, the god of wine, is leaning on his staff that he holds in the right hand. He holds a kantharos, a cup with two high handles, in his left hand. Before him stands a satyr serenading the god with double pipes, while two Cupids approach with more wine."}
