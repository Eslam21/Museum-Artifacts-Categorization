He bears the title of \"the scribe of the divine book\" and he is seen to the left holding his staff and sitting on a stool. Before him, four distinct groups of individuals are shown: first comes the \"scribe of the gold,\" who crouches in front of his scribal materials. He holds a pen, palette and papyrus scroll to record the number of gold ornaments received, which have been laid out before the tomb owner on two mats. The second group depicts another man, perhaps the scribe's assistant, receiving a large collar from a woman holding a bracelet. The next two groups show women wearing collars and bracelets. The artist excels in portraying the variations in poses, attitudes and even hairstyles."}
