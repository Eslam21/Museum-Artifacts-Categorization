{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1168"], "Description": [" Limestone relief of Iry: the slab is carved in fine low relief with a representation of Iry, wearing a leopard-skin and holding a staff and a sceptre. There are traces of black paint on Iry's wig which is of tight curls. He also wears bracelets, and around his neck hangs a curious leafy pendant strung between two beads. His musculature is carefully delineated, but his insteps are unnaturally arched. There are also five smaller representations of men, possibly sons of Iry: Nnk, Nfr-s\u0161m-nsw, 'I\u1e6f\u1e25, the scribe K\u0292(.i)-nfr and 'Iry-n\u1e0fs. The wig, eyebrow, eye, and pupil of the main figure are painted black; no other traces of colour remain.
