It represents the goddess Sakhmet of Memphis, who, in the New Kingdom, was assimilated with Mut, goddess of the Theban triad. Wife of Ptah and mother of Nefertem, Sakhmet incarnated the formidible energy of the sun which was the principle manifestation of the Dangerous Goddess. She was feared because she was capable of sending emissaries who scattered death and sickness amongst mankind, particularly at the beginning of the annual innundation of the Nile. At this moment, litanies were addressed to all the different forms that the goddess could take, in order to placate her. The Brussels statue shows her standing, with the solar disk on her head and a papyrus stem in her hand."}
