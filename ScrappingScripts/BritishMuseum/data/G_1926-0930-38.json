{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.38"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Eros. Eros standing, his right leg advanced, on a curve-fronted plinth with an upper and lower moulding. He wears a chlamys fastened at his chest with a circular brooch, falling down behind him to ankle level, and has a tall Phrygian cap below which his curls show. He holds, with both hands, against his left shoulder a large garlanded torch. Signs of burning round the hole at the top of the torch indicate that it was used to hold incense. By Eros' right side stands a cockerel. The back is plain except for an unpierced suspension-lug and an equally unpierced circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface; traces of an overall white dressing.
