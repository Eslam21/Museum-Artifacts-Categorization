Variants of the name of Amun-Ra are a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. 18, no. 25; on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab was discovered in the 'Scarab Factory' itself with another similar scarab (signalled on the drawing Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 91), likely Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.11. These scarabs belong to the type XXVIII B in Gorton 1996, which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 101-107). Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
