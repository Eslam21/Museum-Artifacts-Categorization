{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5803", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "22.7 cm", "Width": "13.5 cm", "Name": "Hippopotamus", "Description": "Because of the gentle shaping of the body and the lowered head turned to the right, this hippopotamus looks very naturalistic. The strong shoulders are held forward, creating folds at the neck. The eyes are protected by heavy brows, the nostrils are large and deep; the mouth is open, revealing the tusks. The space between the belly, legs and base is not carved free. The base is very damaged. This statuette may once have formed part of a group with the god Horus. In the mouth of the animal is a pierced hole running obliquely downwards. This opening may have served to make the tongue move. "}
