This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The suffix \"19\" was added by the British Museum's Naukratis cataloguing project to distinguish the sherd from the other AM1371 sherds. The lack of a rim prevents a definitive identification of the cup as a South Ionian cup with everted rim. However, the fabric and pattern find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type VIII (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). Hayes' Type VIII is of the same shape as his Type IX (only the interior decoration is different) which coincides with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) Type 9a. The type closely follows the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. These cups also coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18) and and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape.
