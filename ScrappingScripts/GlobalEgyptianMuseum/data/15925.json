Inside the portico, a schoolmaster, called the \"Paedotribe,\" is apparently punishing a child. Hermes, god of science, is depicted as a hermaphrodite. The statue is in the form of a herm, a square stone pillar topped with a head. The herm stands in front of a portico of columns with Corinthian capitals. A child holding a torch is running to the right. Two shields and what is, perhaps, a suspended punching bag for boxing hang on the wall at the back of the portico. Under the punching bag, another child cleans himself after a game."}
