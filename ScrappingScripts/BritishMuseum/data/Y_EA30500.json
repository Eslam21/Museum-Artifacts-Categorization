{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA305"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Neferabu: the decoration on the stela is divided into three parts. At the top is a scene of the Opening of the Mouth ritual. Four mummies stand at the left of the scene; they are those of Neferabu, his wife Taiset, his mother Mahy, and probably his father Neferrenpet. Around them are two male and two female mourners, and in front are four persons. The first of these, a grandson, holds up the adze performing the ritual on the mummies, while the outline draughtsman Maaninakhtef reads from a papyrus, followed by two women. In the second scene, the jackal-headed god Anubis (or perhaps a priest with a jackal mask) leans forward over the mummy. This is a way of representing the embalmment of the deceased, and the jackal-figure is attended on by three sons, a grandson and two women. Genealogies of the family suggest that the mummy shown here is that of Neferrenpet, Neferabu's father.
