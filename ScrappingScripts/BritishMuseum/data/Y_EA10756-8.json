Ramesseum 3, Frame 8. Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script in red and black ink. The recto contains a magico-medical text for mother and child and also for the eyes. On the verso there are some dated accounts with ruled lines. This frame contains sixteen fragments which appear in the following order from top left to bottom right: Frag. 3, A 31-33, one unidentified (possibly part of P. Ramesseum 1), A 31-32, A 12, A 16, A 3 (bottom), A 9, A 13, A 18, A 14, A 21-22, A 30, A 26, A 10 and Frag. 17. The papyrus was a full-height roll. Regarding the accounts on the verso, Gardiner proposes that 'the subject is deliveries of various kinds of grain to the Residence, to a storehouse (mXr), and to the houses of certain individual persons, and that these transactions are dated in the sixth year of some king unknown' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 17). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
