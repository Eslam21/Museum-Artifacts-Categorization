The deity is also known as the \"Soul\" of Buto. Together with the Souls of Nekhen, jackal-headed souls of former kings of Upper Egypt, they are the guardians of kings and are associated with coronations and jubilees. The deity is depicted in the traditional way, kneeling on one knee with one arm raised and the other across the chest. It is likely that this unusual pose was part of a ritual dance. The left arm of the figure was cast separately to achieve this pose."}
