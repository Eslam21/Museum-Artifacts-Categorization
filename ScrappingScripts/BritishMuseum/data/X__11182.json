", " Scorpion is a relatively common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory' in Naukratis (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). They were found at Naukratis itself (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 8-10) and in many sites across the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (notably Gorton 1996, 100, type XXVIIIA, subtype A196-203). It was published by Gorton as belonging to her type XXVIII A (no. 203). It would, however, fit better her type XXXIV A, as this scaraboid is made out of coloured paste and the motif is outline with crossed hatched lines on the body of the scorpion (Gorton 1996, 121-123, type XXXIV A).
