"], "Authority": ["Ruler: Ptolemy II Philadelphos"], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": ["285 BC-246 BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Egypt "], "Excavator/field collector": [" Excavated by: Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie ", " Excavated by: Egypt Exploration Fund "], "Findspot": [" Excavated/Findspot: Great Temenos, From the pylon of Ptolemy II in the Egyptian temple-enclosure, NW corner "], "Materials": ["iron"], "Dimensions": [" Length: 5.70 centimetres ", " Thickness: 1.80 centimetres ", " Width: 4 centimetres (max) ", " Depth: 3.75 centimetres "], "Curator's comments": ["At least six foundation deposits were discovered in Ptolemy II gateway of the Great Temenos, one at each of the four corners and one at the northwest and southwest corners of a central hall (Petrie 1886, 28-31, pl. XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of Naukratis provided a wide variety of models of ceremonial instruments and tools. Fourteen were made of copper alloy, ten of stone and four of iron. Two mortar-spreaders in iron were discovered in the foundation deposits: one in the north-east corner and one in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. XXV no. 6). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-west corner of the pylon. Initially the hollow iron handle of this mortar-spreader was attached to a wooden handle, but it did not survive (it \u2018has wood still in it from a wooden handle\u2019: Petrie 1886, 29; \u2018mortar rake\u2019 republished in Petrie 1917, p. 41, pl. XLVII, no. 10). Models of ceremonial instruments and tools are a customary feature in foundation deposits since the Middle Kingdom. They tend to be of small size and poor quality in the Ptolemaic Period, as during the Late Period (Weinstein 1973, 297, 307-308, 356). Model tools in iron are unusual and not attested in foundation deposits of the Late Period (normally made of copper alloy: Weinstein 1973, 297). Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
