The decoration of the sheathed body can be divided into four sections. The upper section (shoulders and torso) shows the four sons of Horus in groups of two (Duamutef / Amset and Hepi / Qebehsenuf) each pair facing a pectoral adorned with a winged scarab. Along the sides, two registers filled with deities with the head of a human, a scarab, an ibis or a ram. These registers are topped by a row of erect serpents which frame a column of text that mentions Osiris. Although the spelling leaves a lot to be desired, the colours are intense and the drawings are of the utmost quality (particularly the falcon's head). No mummy was found inside this sarcophagus, but, most likely, a so-called \"Corn Osiris\". The falcon figure encircling it is that of Sokar, a chthonic deity."}
