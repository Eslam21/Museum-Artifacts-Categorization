It was essential that it should not be separated from the body even after death, and for this reason, it was left inside the chest during mummification. When the deceased entered the judgment hall, his or her heart would be tested. Only if the heart balanced correctly against Maat would the deceased be declared 'maa-kheru'.This expression, literally translated \"true-of-voice,\" meant that he or she had lived according to the principles of right and proper conduct and was therefore fit to enter the afterlife. The judgement is performed by Anubis and Thoth (here represented by a baboon) often stands-by to ensure an accurate result. Should the deceased fail the judgement, Ammit (\u2018the devourer), a monster which is part crocodile, part lion and part hippopotamus swallowed the heart, depriving the owner of their very being and condemning them to non-existence. On this papyrus the \u2018Lake of Fire\u2019, a place of punishment for the wicked, is also depicted. The cremation of a corpse was abhorrent to the Egyptians since it left no physical remains for the spirit to inhabit. As in all scenes of the weighing, however, the result for Nestanebetisheru is a positive one, for by depicting the deceased as \"true of voice\" a favourable outcome would be assured. The description of this symbolic weighing formed one of the most important texts in the Book of the Dead, and it was regularly accompanied by a detailed illustration. Published: Budge, E. A.
