The thickness of this disc varies between 0,2 and 0,3 cm. The top surface, which is slightly rounded, is polished and relatively well fashioned while the flat bottom surface shows a few irregularities. A small section of the disc is not as thick as the rest and shows wear marks that could indicate that, if it was an earring, it was suspended by the central opening, which is 0,6 cm wide, and that there was friction in this area in particular. This object is associated with an identical but fragmentary disc (see L 2342 (b))."}
