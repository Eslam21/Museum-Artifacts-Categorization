According to iconographic and archaeological evidences, they could be an object of cult, either offered as an ex-voto or part of the funerary equipment (Robinson 2010, 219-220). A mirror of similar shape was discovered in Herakleion-Thonis (Robinson 2010, fig. 19.1). This mirror is very heavy (almost 1kg) which could be an indication of its votive function.
