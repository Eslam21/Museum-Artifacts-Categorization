{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA59205"], "Description": [" Limestone round-topped stela. On one side the stela is inscribed with the words \u2018pr-Snt\u2019, meaning \u2018the estate of Senet\u2019. This has led to suggestions that the object acted as a boundary stela. The opposing side of the stone has not been smoothed or worked to the same standard as the inscribed side, suggesting that only one portion of the stone was visible to a living audience. There are small abrasions to the lower edges of the stela, and a portion of the \u2018s\u2019 hieroglyph beginning Senet\u2019s name has also been damaged. The stela is now supported by a thick modern base.

This has led to suggestions that the stela did not act as a boundary stela as had been previously posited, but instead it may have been placed up against a structure or wall to designate that this belonged to the man named Senet. It has also been noted that this individual\u2019s name has been written without the usual determinative which may suggest his personal connection to the structure that it once stood in front of, possibly a domestic context.

Since Senet's name is written without a determinative, the presence of the actual person may have made this deficiency acceptable, so the stela may have marked Senet's house or domain. It is apparently from a private, non-cultic context: the front doors of elite houses often had an inscription recording the names of their owners. Bibliography: H.G.
