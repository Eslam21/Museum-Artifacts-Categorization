Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab and scaraboid-moulds (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-11). This specimen might be a faulty scarab mould, with an indistinct impression and cracked clay at the back of the mould, and might not have been used. Gorton, A.
