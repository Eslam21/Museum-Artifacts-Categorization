Claude depicted the Flight into Egypt on multiple occasions across his career: see for instance LV38, 60 and 104. All are generally consistnent in the relegation of the biblical episode to a smaller detail in favour of a striking depiction of a landscape inspired by the Roman Campagna. The composition itself is a modification on that first explored in LV93 and also compares with LV104 and LV117. The present composition records a painting that Claude made for a Mr. Parasson in Lyons together with its pendant of LV109 (see 1957,1214.115). It had passed into the possession of Cardinal Marazin by 1653 and is now in Dresden (see inv. no. 730; canvas, 102 x 134 cm; Roethlisberger 1986 no. 175).
