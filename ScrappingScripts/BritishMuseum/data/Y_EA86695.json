{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86695"], "Description": [" Comparatively small but complete seal-impression with one big rows of basketry coil impression at one side, at the other side maybe further basketry impressions, but not very clear. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica. The clay was hardened after excavation. The front shows an almost complete impression of an oval scarab-like seal, the upper part was stamped too close to the edge and is therefore not preserved. The seal shows two upright cobras left an right facing to the centre of the seal, flanking a cartouche, most likely Mn-khpr-R'. Underneath a horizontal line and under this a winged khpr. The left part is not preserved as it was squashed by a finger impression.
