{"artifact_name": "stamp", "Object Type": ["stamp"], "Museum number": ["EA43423"], "Description": [" A solidly made object, roughly of flask form, with two flat faces: probably a stamp for Eucharist bread (the Korb\u00e2n). On one face is a series of nine squares, in three rows of three, each decorated with diagonal crosses, with triangular depressions in the angles, except the central square, which has a cross within a quatrefoil and triangular depressions at the corners. The central square of the nine may be for producing the isbodikon, that part of the host that was placed in the wine during Communion, the smaller crosses being broken off as wafers. On the other face, within a circle, is a large equal-armed cross, also capable of being used as a stamp for the isbodikon. The sides and bottom are trimmed flat; on the top is a circular-sectioned lug, possibly with breaks. Dark-brown Nile silt, with some mica. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Byzantine (?)

Morton (1938:168-77) describes the use of the Eucharist bread at a mass and a christening he attended in a church in Old Cairo in the mid-1930s (both the mass and the bread are called the Korb\u00e2n). He also illustrates (ibid.: 344-5) examples of the Korb\u00e2n baked in an oven at the Monastery of St Antony.
