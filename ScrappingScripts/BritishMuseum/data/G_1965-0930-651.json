Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana, Band, and Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. Hayes suggested a Rhodian origin for these types of cups but this is uncertain (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 114). Schlotzhauer points out that the same myrtle pattern is found on Fikellura style pottery from Miletus and thus suggest a South Ionian or more specifically Milesian origin for the cups (Schlotzhauer 2012, 108-9).
