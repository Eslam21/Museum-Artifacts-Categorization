{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3985", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FUNERARY CONE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; UNSPECIFIED", "Height": "19 cm", "Diameter": "7.5 cm", "Name": "Funerary cone", "Description": "The \"funerary cones\", which appeared from the 11th Dynasty particularly at Thebes, are in fact a special form of seals presenting at their base a short offering formula or more simply the titles and the name of the deceased. One does not only find them inside or near the tombs of the beneficiaries, but also in the sanctuaries where the offerings in favour of the gods were also reserved for the deceased. This example, which was acquired in Cairo in 1901 by J. Capart, bears on its base an inscription in three lines mentioning the title and the name of the owner. It dates from the New Kingdom."}
