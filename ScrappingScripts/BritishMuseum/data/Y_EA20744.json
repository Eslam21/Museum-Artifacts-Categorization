{"artifact_name": "mummy-case; cartonnage; human mummy", "Object Type": [" mummy-case ", " cartonnage ", " human mummy "], "Museum number": ["EA20744"], "Description": [" Mummy of a girl (7 years, +/- 3 years), named Tjayasetimu.The mummy is enclosed in a cartonnage case in the shape of an adult woman. The decoration of the case is almost entirely obliterated by a coating of black resin which has been poured over it. The case has the left arm crossed over the breast; the right, the forearm of which is made of wood and is attached by a simple slip joint to the right elbow, lies extended on the side of the body. This wooden forearm is a very unusual feature and it must have been added after the blackening of the case; it is quite unmarked by resin. It is gilded and painted red with a black and yellow bracelet represented on the wrist. Skull - No obvious fractures. The mouth is slightly open. All teeth, including some unerupted, are apparently present. The cervical spine appears intact. No evidence that the brain has been removed. Long hair preserved (below the shoulders). Thorax and Abdomen - Apart from some opacification of the lumbar disc spaces, the spinal column and bony cage appear normal and are free from fractures and dislocations. The abdominal cavity has been tightly packed with some granular material (probably a mixture of sawdust and sand) which could well obscure visceral bundles if any. The upper part of the packing follows the curve of the diaphragm, and as the thoracic cavity appears empty it is likely that this structure has not been interfered with. The bottom part of the packing ends at the pelvic brim. Pelvis - Apparently empty. The pelvic bones and hips appear normal. Arms - Extended. The palms of the hands, fingers extended, rest upon the antero-medial aspect of the thighs. Legs - Apart from lines of arrested growth in the upper and lower ends of the tibiae, the bones and joints appear normal and are free from fractures and dislocations. The feet appear normal. Inscription: the hieroglyphic text in the centre of the case reads: 'An offering which the king gives to Osiris-Sokar who resides in his shetayet-shrine, the great god, the lord of heaven, the ruler of eternity in Heliopolis, in order that he might give water to the ba, offerings to the corpse and clothing to the mummy of the One who is Praised in the Interior of Amun Tjayasetimu, daughter of Pakharu, justified.'
