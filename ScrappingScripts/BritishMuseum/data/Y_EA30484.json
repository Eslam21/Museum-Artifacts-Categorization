{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA30484"], "Description": [" Fish amulet: made from gold with a green felspar inlay. The amulet is open on both sides. The central cloison, to which are attached fins and tail, is roughly made from a strip of sheet metal curved around to make an oval shape. The inlay is a piece of felspar which has been broken and repaired. A disc of gold foil represents the head on each side of the inlay; on one of these discs a ring is soldered to represent the eye. Tail and fins are soldered on to the cloison; only one of the two lower fins is present. The fins are scored on one face only now, but one face is heavily rubbed and may have lost its details. The tail is scored on both faces to represent the natural ridges; it is strengthened on one face by the addition of a small rectangle of gold. A ring for suspension is attached at the nose.
