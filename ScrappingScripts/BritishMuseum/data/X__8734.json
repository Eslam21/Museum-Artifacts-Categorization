", " The sherd was lost in WWII. Lemos identifies the lion on the second frieze as a lotus flower and lotus bud. The cup shape is not a typical form in the Sphinx and Lion Style. Contemporary with the Sphinx and Lion Style is the Mature Animal Style in which cups are the most typical form. Incision is not found on vases of the Mature Animal Style but the the interior decoration and exterior filling ornament on this sherd are very typical of that style. This cup, one of only a few, appears to be influenced by both styles. For another example, see British Museum 1924, 1201.208 and 1965,0930.305.
