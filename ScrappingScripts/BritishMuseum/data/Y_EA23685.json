{"artifact_name": "mortarium; bowl", "Object Type": [" mortarium ", " bowl "], "Museum number": ["EA23685"], "Description": [" A pottery mortarium, or shallow grinding-bowl, with a flat base and flaring sides. The fabric in the core is very coarse, apparently common red-brown Nile silt, but the surface is coated with a slip of yellow-green clay. This was probably intended to imitate the appearance of imported mortaria. A hole has been worn through the base by use and the rim is very chipped.
