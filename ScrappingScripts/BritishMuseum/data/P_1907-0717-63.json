This is the only sheet in the group which is executed with charcoal and white heightening. Although the features of the figures faces recall very closely Domenico's style, the outlines are generally very dry and this drawing is probably a copy. Notable is the male figure on the right, fully attired as a soldier, feature that does not appear in any of the other drawings of this series, but that vaguely recalls the demon that appears in the foreground on the right of a painting by Domenico representing 'The Temptation of St Antony' (cf. P. Rossi, 'Per il catalogo di Jacopo e Domenico Tintoretto: novit\u00e0 e precisazioni', \"Arte Veneta\", 55, 1999, fig. 6).
