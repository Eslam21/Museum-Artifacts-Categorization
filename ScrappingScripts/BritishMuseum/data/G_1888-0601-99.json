{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.99"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of a seated warrior. A soldier seated in a hunched position on a block with a grooved front (a log?), supported by a low, plain rectangular plinth. He is muffled up in drapery from neck to feet; his right arm is enveloped in the cloth and his hand pulls it tightly around him. His left arm and hand are completely hidden and hold a domed circular shield with a wide rim close to his left side. He wears a plain conical helmet of the bell type, with an encircling channel just above the brim, below which is shown a row of curls. The back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with substantial remains, particularly on the front, of a white dressing; the face and feet are painted orange-pink, and the clothing is white, although a tiny patch of red paint survives in a fold by the right arm. The channel of the helmet is painted pink and the block on which he sits bears orange paint.
