{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86912"], "Description": [" Very small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a a flat surface with imprints of some organics, probably wood? One impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.2cm is visible in the break. The upper side is flat. Less than two thirds of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable are two registers, the upper one shows three figures, the one on the left side seems to be seated, maybe Re-Harakhte, the middle one looks mummy-shaped with a staff in front of the body, probably Ptah. The figure on the right shows a standing female goddess also holding a staff in front of her, probably Sekhmet. The lower register shows half of a kneeling figure with the hands raised (C11). The same motif is found on EA86904 with the right part of the impression better preserved.
