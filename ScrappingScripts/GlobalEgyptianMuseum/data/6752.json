He is seated on a four-legged stool, of which the details of the woodwork and the canework are indicated. A closed chest is placed to the left of the stool. In relation to the torso, the legs are disproportionately small. They encircle a cylindrical object on to which is placed a smaller square object (possibly an anvil block and its anvil?).  With his left hand, the figure holds a disc-shaped object onto these.  The right hand is brought back along the chest, the fist pierced by a hole in which a tool would have been inserted. There are numerous traces of various colours: pink on the shirt, black for the suspenders(?), white on the tunic, and red for the chest. "}
