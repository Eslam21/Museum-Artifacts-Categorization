{"artifact_name": "game-board; platter(?)", "Object Type": [" game-board ", " platter (?) "], "Museum number": ["EA22323"], "Description": [" A circular pottery platter, reconstructed from four fragments with two small parts missing. The central part of the upper surface is scored with a pattern of lines in a grid-pattern of 10 x 3 squares, for use as a game-board. This pattern was incised after firing. The platter is made from a low-fired red-brown siltware fabric containing sand and grit temper. The surface was covered by a pale cream slip, which has worn off in places. The edge of the platter is rounded and the underside is uneven. Number and distribution of squares suggest that the object is a board for the traditional Egyptian senet-game.
