The typical hoe took the form of a blade of wood attached to a handle, with a rope running between the two to allow the angle of the blade to be modified, as represented in the hieroglyph. This example is a simpler form made from one piece of wood. For an 18th dynasty hoe found with a mallet, chisel and boning rods, at Deir el-Bahri, see Egypt's Golden Age (exhibition catalogue, Boston, 1982): 46 no.14"], "Location": ["On display (G61/dc6/sB)"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 1998/9 Oct-Jun, South Carolina, The Charleston Museum, Queens Commoners of the New Kingdom 2001 26 Jun-23 Sep, Birmingham Gas Hall, Egypt Revealed "], "Condition": ["good"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Joseph Sams"], "Acquisition date": ["1834"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA5408"], "Registration number": [".5408"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.5408 (Birch Slip Number) "], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 25 Jun 2008 ", " Treatment: 26 Jun 1997 ", " Treatment ", " Treatment: 09 Apr 2001 "]}
