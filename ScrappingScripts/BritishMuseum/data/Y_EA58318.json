This amulet could represent the sacred ram, an animal associated to Amun in Naukratis, with forward curving horns (on various types of ram's amulets: Herrmann et al. 2010, 87-88). The ram-headed god Amun-Ra Baded was the main deity revered in Naukratis (Guermeur 2005, 126-138; Yoyotte 1982/83). However, the context of discovery, the sanctuary of Apollo, make it rather dubious. Apollo in his shape Apollo Karneios was also associated to the ram. Guermeur, I. 2005. Les cultes d\u2019Amon hors-de-Th\u00e8bes, Turnhout.
