This drawing records a painting that Claude make for a patron in Lyon between 1646 and 1647. This painting is now in The Met (inv.no. 47.12; canvas, 106 x 135 cm; Roethlisberger 1986, no. 174). It numbers among a multitude of Pastoral landscapes that Claude produced across his career and which were visions of an Arcadia clearly inspired by the Roman Campagna. The present painting is believed to have formed a pendant to the contemporary Pastoral Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (see 1957,1214.116). The inscription on the verso of this latter drawing allows for an identification of the patron of the painting recorded on the present sheet as a M. Parasson. Lit: M.
