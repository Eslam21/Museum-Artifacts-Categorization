This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " If the identification of Nefertum is correct, this amulet belongs to a type of amulet relatively well represented in Naukratis, may the figure be in copper alloy, glazed composition or stone (Masson 2015, 77, fig. 3.8). Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and at Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Hill and Schorsch 2007, 143-145; Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217). Even though the MFA database lists the Scarab Factory as the findspot, the EEF list seems to list this object separately from those objects found in the Scarab Factory. Caution is therefore required for the specific findspot of this piece and, subsequently, its dating should not be only limited to the activity of the Scarab Factory in the 26th dynasty.
