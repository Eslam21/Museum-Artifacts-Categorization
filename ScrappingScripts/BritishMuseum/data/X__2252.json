This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). Modelled heads of Bes on a plaque or a disc, dated to the Third Intermediate Period onwards, bear sometimes the representation of a wedjat eye on the other side, like on this specimen (Andrews 1994, 40; examples illustrated in Petrie 1914, pl. XXXIV no. 190q; Hornung, Staehelin 1976, no. 694). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty.
