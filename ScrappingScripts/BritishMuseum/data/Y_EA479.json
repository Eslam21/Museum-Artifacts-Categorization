{"artifact_name": "pyramidion", "Object Type": ["pyramidion"], "Museum number": ["EA479"], "Description": [" Sandstone pyramidion of Hornefer: each face of this pyramidion is divided into two sections by a horizontal line of text consisting of an invocation by the workman Hornefer to Ra and other gods. The lower parts of three sides are further divided by a column of text in the middle of each containing a prayer by Hornefer. All representations are carved in sunk relief and all texts are incised. On one face the barque of Ra is depicted in the upper section, and at the top of the pyramidion is inscribed the name of Ra-Horakhty-Atum. Below, the \u02bf\u0292 n \u02bfm st m\u0292\u02bft Hornefer and his 'son', the \u02bf\u0292 n \u02bf m st m\u0292\u02bft Hornefer, stand facing each other with their arms raised in adoration. On the upper part of the second face the goddesses Isis and Nephthys kneel in adoration of the Amentet standard, the upper part of which is damaged. Below, Hornefer and his wife Nfrt-\u1ec9ry stand with arms raised in worship. The upper part of the third face is heavily damaged and only the lower part of a figure holding a sceptre can be discerned. Below, the workman \u02bf\u0292-\u1e25t p.f stands in adoration together with his daughter (written S\u0292.f but with female figure and female determinative) whose name is damaged but may end in .. .'dbt'. On the upper part of the fourth face appears a winged scarab with sun-disk and, below, Hornefer and his wife Wb\u1e2bt stand in adoration. The pyramidion is severely damaged at the base and at the top resulting in loss to both scenes and text in varying degrees of severity. There are several large gouges on the surface. There are no traces of colour.

Each Hornefer is depicted with his wife ontwo of the faces, although it is not clear which couple is the older and which represents the younger. Only the couple Hornefer-Nefertari is attested elsewhere. An \u02bf\u0292 n \u02bf m st m\u0292\u02bft Hornefer, son of Nebdjefau, who flourished in the reign of Ramses II is well known from other monuments in this collection and elsewhere. He is possibly the workman who is attested in Year 40 of Ramses II, while the younger Hornefer may be the workman who appears under Sety II and Sipta. Bibliography: G.
