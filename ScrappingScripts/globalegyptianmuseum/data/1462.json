One of the fragments (E.8390; see photo) contains a colour vignette representing the famous scene of the \"weighing of the heart\". At the right, one notices the deceased who enters the \"Hall of Truth\"  in the company of the goddess Maat. Before them stands the scales, checked by the gods Horus and Anubis. Next we see the \"Devourer\", the god Thoth who writes the result of the weighing on a leaf of papyrus, and the four Sons of Horus placed on a lotus flower. The god Osiris, seated on a throne, oversees the whole scene."}
