{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "6225", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "ASIUT", "Category": "BREWERY (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "18.6 cm", "Width": "16.3 cm", "Name": "Model of a brewery", "Description": "Since bread and beer were the main victuals in Egypt, the models representing their production were an often item of tomb equipment starting from the late Old Kingdom. This piece as it is demonstrated in the Egyptian gallery of the Hermitage consists of seven statuettes attached to a board. At the right, an oven for baking and a figure of a kneeling man are placed. Behind the man there is an unidentifiable rectangular object, probably a kind of box. The process of making beer of the bread baked in this oven is represented in the left part of the model, where a man is shown stirring wort in a large vessel. The role of the two male figures sitting nearby is obscure. Three sitting man in the centre do not belong to the original composition; being images of oarsmen from a model boat, they were pasted to the board by mistake or in order to inflate the price of the brewery. All the men wear knee-long garments and wigs covering their ears. The bodies are painted red, the garments are white, the wigs and eyes are white."}
