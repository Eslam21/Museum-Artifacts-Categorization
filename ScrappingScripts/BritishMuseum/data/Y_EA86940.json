The fragment is shaped convex on the bag showing impressions of textile or leather, probably from a bag and an impression of a turned string with a width of 0.22 cm is visible. The front is convex and shows one impression of an almost complete scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal bears a circumferential line and shows a standing figure on the right side, facing towards the left. The figure is wearing a blue crown, one arm hanging down behind the body, probably holding an ankh sign, the second arm is positioned in front of the body holding a HqA-sceptre. In front of the figure a small cartouche (Mn-kheper-R')|. The same motif can be found on EA86935, EA86936 and EA86939.
