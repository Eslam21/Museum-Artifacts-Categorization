In the upper section is a winged sun-disk beneath which is a scarab beetle and a \u0161n-sign. On either side of these an 'wedjat'-eye and a recumbent jackal are depicted. In the second is a 'kheker'-frieze. There is a scene in the third register below a sky-sign with stars. The deceased stands on the right with arms raised in worship before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind the altar Ra-Horakhty is enthroned. A winged Isis stands behind him enfolding a \u0161n-sign, and behind her stand the four sons of Horus. In the fourth register four lines of text contain a prayer to Osiris on behalf of the lady Qeres, daughter of \u1e6e\u0292-n-rw\u1e0f and the lady \u1e6es-Mwt-prw.
