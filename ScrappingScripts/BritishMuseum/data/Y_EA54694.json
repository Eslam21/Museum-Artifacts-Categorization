{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA54694"], "Description": [" Pottery vase: this vase is shaped like a woman carrying a small child on her back. On her lap she holds a simple horn container, with the spoon resting on her open left palm. The child is wrapped in his mother's shawl, the fringed edge of which is visible along his back. His legs can be seen beneath the shawl; with his free right arm, he clutches his mother's upper arm. The crossing edges of the mother's garments are difficult to interpret, but beneath the shawl there is at least one garment, tied at the neck. The woman wears her hair in a long ponytail which partially covers the child's body. She has two strands of beads around her neck; the child seems to wear a single bracelet. The figure's pose is well balanced and relaxed. The spout is completely separate from the handle, which is a ring attached to the back of the head.
