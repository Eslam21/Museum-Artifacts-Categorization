Under the winged sun disk, two symmetrical scenes show the king in ceremonial costume offering Maat, which stands for Truth, and two wine jars to Amun. The second register, or section, shows two parallel scenes in which the king stands in his horse-drawn chariot. Above him the goddess Nekhbet spreads her protective wings and gives the signs of life, stability, and dominion. A quiver of arrows hangs on his back while a larger one is attached to the chariot. The contorted bodies of enemies overlap everywhere, one even hangs from the chariot. At the bottom of the stela is a frieze, or decorated band, of Rekhyt birds, or lapwings with human arms, that symbolize all the people he rules. They are depicted as endlessly worshiping the pharaoh."}
