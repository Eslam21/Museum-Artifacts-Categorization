Some of them originated from a cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city: it contained nineteen statuettes of Osiris, twelve of which were complete (Petrie 1886, 41-42). Osiris is by far the most represented deity in the corpus of bronze figures from Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). Bronzes representing Osiris, as well as the other members of the Osirian triad - Isis and Harpokrates, are conspicuous in Late Period and Ptolemaic bronze votive deposits all over Egypt (see for example the large caches from North Saqqara where members of the Osirian triad represent three quarter of the bronze figures: Emery 1970, 6). The Osirian cult is important in the saite nome, and particularly in Sais itself as stressed by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 445), but also on a more local scale (Masson 2015). This figure belongs to the type 81 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a type that is found on various sites of the Delta, such as Sais, Herakleion, Bubastis, Athribis, Saqqara, Memphis, Tanis, and notably in Late Period contexts (Weiss 2012, 171-172, 627-633, Taf. 22b-i, Typ 81). The very flat and crude design featured on this figure is found on other Naukratite bronzes, such as: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.247, 86.251, 86.253, 86.261 and 86.284; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.616; BM 1885,1101.91.
