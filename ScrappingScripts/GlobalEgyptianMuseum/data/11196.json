A king is depicted wearing a splendid composite crown, which is probably the so-called feather crown composed of two tall ostrich feathers. Only the serrated outlines of the feathers have been preserved in the relief. The feathers are set on a pair of massive ram's horns with a solar disk and a pair of smaller bull's horns attached to them. Two upright cobras appear on either side of the feathers; their heads are now missing. Two smaller cobras are appended from the horns. The king has the uraeus on his forehead. His ceremonial beard has a small curve at the tip, and he wears a broad collar without any details."}
