This tradition is purely Egyptian, although the style derives from Graeco-Roman portraiture. These masks show the head or the upper part of the body of the deceased with the hands placed on the chest; jewels, crowns, garlands are employed as decorative motifs. The Brussels plaster mask shows a man with an oval face. The large and slightly elongated eyes are inlaid. The piece bears a crown of vegetation symbolizing victory over death."}
