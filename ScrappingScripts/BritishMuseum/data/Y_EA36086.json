Many very close parallels are attested (for example: Petrie 1906, pl. 11, no. 210; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, no. 894; see especially the references listed in Magnarini 2004, 10.73-75). Such scenes are already known in the Second Intermediate Period, but from the presence of the blue crown, the scarab cannot be dated before the New Kingdom (Magnarini 2004, 336). The back is hastily made which points towards a mass-production of the 20th-21st dynasty (Magnarini 2004, 335). A scarab in brown steatite showing a similar design was discovered in the Third Intermediate Period cemetery at Matmar (Brunton, G. 1948. Matmar, London, pl. 63, 109). The finds at Matmar are mainly dated to the 8th-7th century BC. Brunton, G. 1948, Matmar, London.
