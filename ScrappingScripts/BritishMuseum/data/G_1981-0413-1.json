{"artifact_name": "bread-stamp", "Object Type": ["bread-stamp"], "Museum number": ["1981,0413.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta circular bread-stamp. A circular bread-stamp, with applied elongated grip (damaged) on the centre back. It has an incuse pattern: within two wreaths (a myrtle wreath encircling a tightly woven floral wreath, bound in three places) a garlanded bull walks (in the impression) to left and faces to front. Petals of a flower radiate behind him and above his back is a smaller, four-petalled bloom. He does not seem to be an Apis Bull, but a sacrificial beast. Made by pressing over a plaster form. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with a greybrown core and a few white grits.
