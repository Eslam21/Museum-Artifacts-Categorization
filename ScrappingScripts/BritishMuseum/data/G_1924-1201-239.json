All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 93). However, the thickness of this sherd is substantially greater than most light-walled Chian vessels; it may well be from a heavy chalice."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
