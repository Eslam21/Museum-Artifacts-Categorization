{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5979", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURED OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "DRAWING", "Height": "39 cm", "Width": "42 cm", "Name": "Ostracon with a royal head", "Description": "Smooth pieces of limestone were often used for making patterns, sketches, and designs. The high quality and unusual size of the Vienna pictorial ostracon suggests that it was part of the decoration of one of the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. The figure represented is wearing the royal headcloth with the uraeus and the atef-crown. The crown consists of a reed crown topped by a ram's head with a solar disk (a depiction of Amun), and combined with ram's horns, ostrich feathers and two cobras with cow's horns and a solar disk. The latter probably represent the goddesses of Upper Egpyt and Lower Egypt. The king is holding the crook and flail in his hands. The original drawing was done in a bright red, over which corrections were made in dark red."}
