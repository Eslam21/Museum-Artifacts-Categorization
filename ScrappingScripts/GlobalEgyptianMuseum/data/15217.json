{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 134", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "CALCITE/ALABASTER", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "50 cm", "Name": "Woman with her Hands Wrapped Around her Body", "Description": "The statue depicts a woman wrapping her hands around her body. She wears a wig, from which her underlying natural hair shows. A full-length garment is wrapped around her body. Her large figure is carved from a single block of alabaster, which undoubtedly accounts for the rigid pose. The arms are close to her body and the shoulders are cramped. The length of the body is exaggerated. However, it is apparent that the sculptor desired the modeling to be elaborate. For example, the hair, eyes, and eyebrows were originally painted in black and the nails were coated in red. The base of the statue is made of wood."}
