{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1888:22", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "IBIS MUMMY", "Material": "POTTERY; LINEN", "Height": "46 cm", "Diameter": "15 cm", "Name": "Mummified ibis in a pottery jar", "Description": "Pottery jar with lid, containing a mummified ibis, the bird sacred to Thoth. From the Late Period to Roman Period literally millions of ibis were mummified and buried in animal cemeteries. The centre of the Thoth cult in Upper Egypt was at el-Ashmunein, but the largest number of mummies survived at Saqqara, the cemeteries of Memphis. Demotic and Greek texts of the Ptolemaic Period reveal the existence of ibis farms to meet the demand. The precise reasons for the practice are not known, but the cult of the Ibis was both supported by the state (paying for the maintenance and cutting of catacombs) and extremely popular (with numerous votive texts on individual ibis coffins and images)."}
