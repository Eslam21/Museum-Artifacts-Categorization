Composed of one row of disc-shaped beads carved from ostrich eggshell. In the middle, a pattern is repeated three times: one large disc-shaped bead framed by two smaller ones (all three carved from ostrich eggshell) and two disc-shaped beads of blue enamel. The central motif is separated from the other two by two small disc-shaped golden beads. Gold is rarely found in Nubian burials because it is the material that was robbed first."}
