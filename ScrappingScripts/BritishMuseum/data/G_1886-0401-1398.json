{"artifact_name": "figure; vessel", "Object Type": [" figure ", " vessel "], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1398"], "Description": [" East Greek terracotta figure vase (plastic vase). Complete mould-made vase, minus parts of rim, in the form of a seated woman. She sits on a throne with a footstool, hands on knees. She wears a low stephane and headband behind long curly hair parted centrally and resting on her shouldars. She wears a red chiton and symmetrical himation covering her head, back, sides and hanging in folds from the knees. The modelling is sketchy. She has almond shaped eyes. Traces of black paint on hair and throne, and red paint on clothes and rim. White coating under some of the red paint, though in other areas white residue appears to be post depositional. Orange-brown fine Milesian clay fabric with abundant fine mica and rare white inclusions.

There is a close parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525 BC - 400 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2115). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9), but is probably Milesian as Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). Higgins cites parallels from Cumae, Selinus, Lindos, Ialysus and Thera (Maximova 1927, no. 68; Blinkenberg 1931, pl.95, no. 2117, see also pl. 96, no. 2129; Higgins 1954, 50). An East Greek kore flask parallel from Clazomenae is dated to the mid 6th century BC (Ersoy 2007, pl. 19.2). A close parallel was found at the Turkish site of Erythrae and was dated to the end of the 6th century BC (Bayburtluo\u011flu 1977, pl.19, no.31). Bayburtluo\u011flu, C. 1977. Erythrai II. Ankara.
