The scene is framed by a long and thick sign of the sky, curved along the round edge of the top of the stela, resting on both sides on was-scepters. To the right, the king walking leftwards, wearing the nemes-headdress with an uraeus, and a short kilt with the bull\u2019s tail to the back, presents in front of him the small globular wine vases (nw-vases) to Amun-Ra, walking rightwards, wearing his double plumed and disked headdress, followed by Mut, feet together, wearing a sheath dress and the vulture headdress topped by the double crown. Both deities wear a was scepter in the left hand and the ankh-sign in the right one.
