{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.95"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Bes. Bes, or a priest in a religious procession wearing a mask of Bes. He walks to right, carrying against his left shoulder a statuette of an Egyptian god or king. He wears a brief tunic with short sleeves, tied at the waist, from below which his phallus emerges to reach to the ground, and he holds a small round pot against his right side; an unidentified object lies by his left foot: it may be the head of an animal, turned to front, the rear end of which emerged behind Bes\u2019s right leg, but is now largely lost. The statuette against his shoulder stands stiffly in an Egyptian manner, with its arms by its sides, wearing a short kilt. Its head is lost, as also is most of the Bes crown. The group stands on a plain, flat-faced plinth, broken. The back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica, quartz and white inclusions.
