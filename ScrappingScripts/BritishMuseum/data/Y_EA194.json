{"artifact_name": "block", "Object Type": ["block"], "Museum number": ["EA194"], "Title": ["Object: The 'Crossword' Stela"], "Description": [" The 'Crossword' Stela of Peser: a square limestone stela, now badly damaged, with an incised frieze of deities along the top; these worship a figure of the goddess Mut, which is now lost. The area below is covered with a grid, each square of which contains a group of hieroglyphic signs originally filled with blue pigment. This 'crossword' is sixty-seven squares wide and eighty squares deep, but may originally have been eighty by eighty. The top horizontal line of text reads from right to left and provides the title for the rest of the inscription, which is a Middle Egyptian hymn to Mut, as well as indicating how the stela is to be read.

Verbal wordplay was a common stylistic device in hymns, and this is a graphic extension of the same principle. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
