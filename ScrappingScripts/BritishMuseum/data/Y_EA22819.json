{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-jug", "Object Type": ["cosmetic-jug"], "Museum number": ["EA22819"], "Description": [" Glass cosmetic jug with globular body: this jug, with its almost cylindrical neck and single vertical handle from upper neck to shoulder is a copy in glass of the well-known Cypriote base-ring I juglet, a relatively rare shape among Egyptian glass vessels. The opaque purple-blue glass body has a glossy surface. Both foot and rim are encircled with prefabricated dark blue and yellow cords. Two heavy yellow threads encircle the upper neck. The thread decorations of the body are in yellow and turquoise-blue, chevrons on the neck and a flame pattern on the body. The handle has applied thread decorations also in yellow and light blue suggesting an origin at Medinet Ghurab. The foot is solid. The neck is broken and replaced just above the join with the body. The greater part of the handle is lost. "], "Authority": ["Ruler: Amenhotep III (or later)"], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (?) ", " 19th Dynasty (?)
