", " Jones 1990 The black basalt slab known as the Shabaka Stone preserves the only surviving copy of an important Egyptian religious text usually referred to as the Memphite Theology of Creation. In the earliest tradition surviving from Egypt the creation of the world was ascribed to the god Atum of Heliopolis, but the theology of Memphis sought to give a prior claim to Ptah, patron god of that city, by crediting him with the creation of the other gods and thereby, indirectly, with the creation of the world. The inscription, much damaged on account of the slab's having been reused as a millstone, dates from the reign of the Nubian Pharaoh Shabaka, of the 25th Dynasty (c. 716-702 BC), and it was originally set up in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. It purports to be a copy of an ancient worm-eaten document which the pharaoh ordered to be transcribed for posterity, and the compiler of the text has reproduced the layout of early documents and introduced a number of archaic spellings and grammatical usages to lend the piece an air of antiquity. In fact, it is now generally accepted that the text in its present form was composed in Shabaka's own time, and that the story of the rescue of the papyrus is an example of a rhetorical device well known in Egyptian royal inscriptions and should not be accepted as a piece of genuine history. However, it is still a matter for dispute whether the content of the text embodies a genuinely ancient religious tradition or whether the document is purely a work of the 25th Dynasty, both in wording and subject matter. On the strength of the latter dating it has been postulated that the stone was intended as a piece of propaganda, aimed at securing the allegiance of an influential section of the Egyptian populace. Shabaka reigned at a period when Nubian rulers were trying to establish firm control over the whole of Egypt; Memphis, the first capital and one of the most important cities in the land, had been a focal point for opposition to the Nubians and had only recently been conquered. By erecting an inscription which gave new prestige to the city's patron deity, Shabaka was probably seeking to pacify and conciliate the inhabitants and gain the support of the powerful Memphite priesthood.
