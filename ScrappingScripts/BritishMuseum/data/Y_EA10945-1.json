", " Two main scribes can be determined, who are not only distinguishable by their hands and idiosyncrasies of orthography (e.g. the writing of Osiris), but by multiple occurrences of the same spells of the ritual and the varying width of the columns (e.g. one very narrow, the other broader). The upper row (first scribe) contains the scenes (numbering after Otto 1960) Sc. 23 I-II and Sc. 25\u201327. The middle one (second scribe) includes Sc. 29-31II and Sc. 32\u201336. The bottom row shows one fragment (rightmost), which might belong to the manuscript of the first scribe, with parts of scene No. 31II-32 inscribed on it. As it could not be placed at a definite position in respect to the other fragments, it must be left under the unplaced ones. The other three fragments seem to show the same hand, very small and cursory in style. This would therefore be a third scribe. They comprise Sc. 27 and 48, but the last one (leftmost) contains too little text to be completely sure about its content. The text of the first scribe addresses to Sokar-Osiris as the beneficiary. The pieces of the second scribe are more specific: They mention an \u2018Osiris-the-Baboon (pA jAnj)\u2019 and \u2018Osiris-the-Ibis (pA hbj)\u2019. These names refer probably to animal mummies and can also be found on other fragments of EA 10945, written by different scribes and containing different kinds of rituals (see frame 2). This might point to the same library or scribal school as a source. Considering the animals ibis and baboon, a possible provenance could be either Hermopolis, modern Tuna el-Gebel (see e.g. Kessler 1998; Kessler 2011), or North Saqqara (Davies 2006; Ray 2011); in both of them large cemeteries for Thoth\u2019s sacred animals existed.
