{"artifact_name": "figure(?)", "Object Type": ["figure (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA68824"], "Description": [" Piece of limestone which has been crudely carved, possibly intended to represent a human figure. This fragment of soft limestone has been worked into a stylised shape with rough indications of a head, arms, and legs. The head area has an additional semi-circular shaped layer of limestone, and the area directly underneath has a raised ridge \u2013 possibly intended to represent the face of the figure. There are visible traces of black paint across the surface on both sides. The figure has a large chip to the left leg on the reverse, and numerous further abrasions across the surface of the reverse. There are also visible chips to the \u2018chest\u2019 area of the figure and at the arms and legs.

These are relatively rare at Naukratis and highly variable in form, with a selection of other prisoner figures now held in various collections (see list in Thomas 2015). \u2018Rude stone figures\u2019 were recognised by Petrie to be a local, early production, dating to the 6th \u2013 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886); these have since been dated more specifically to c. 620 \u2013 400 BC (Thomas 2015, also provides a further list of comparable examples from sites including Saqqara, Tell Dafana, and Herakleion). A possible female prisoner figure from Naukratis made from terracotta is now held in the Museum of Classical Archaeology (Cambridge, NA494). The provenance for this figure is recorded as the sanctuary of Apollo at Naukratis alongside two other votive objects also within the British Museum collection (EA 68823 (1886,0401.1489) and EA 68825 (1886,0401.1492)), however it\u2019s also noted that the location of these finds may be the result of a later \u2018disturbed context\u2019 (Thomas 2015). Other possible captive figures from other contexts at Naukratis are included in the British Museum collection (such as EA 68820 (1886,0401.1485) and 2011, 2011.7). Further Bibliography: R.I.
