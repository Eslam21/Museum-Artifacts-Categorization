{"artifact_name": "ear-ring", "Object Type": ["ear-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA14351"], "Description": [" Gold penannular ear-ring: made in two halves from a thick sheet of gold, shaped and then soldered together. At either end of the pennanular loop a further small piece of sheet gold was added to give the impression that the ear-ring was not hollow. The exterior seam is hidden by an applied band in the form of a rope plaited from three fine wires of gold; the interior seam was not further obscured. As observed, it has two circular loops at the end of the plait for fixing.
