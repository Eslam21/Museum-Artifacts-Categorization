Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Females wearing a sakkos headdress, often in combinaiton with the rosette earrings, are very common in the late Cypro-Archaic period down through the 5th century BC.
