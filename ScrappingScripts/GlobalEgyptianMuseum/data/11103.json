{"Present location": "PELIZAEUS-MUSEUM [04/030] HILDESHEIM", "Inventory number": "3184", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BASALT", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "27.3 cm", "Width": "12.2 cm", "Depth": "10 cm", "Name": "Torso of a statue", "Description": "The statue depicts a nude man standing with his legs together. The arms are pendant beside his body and held slightly forward. The hands are fisted and hold cloth amulets.  The arms are connected to the body, and the body itself to the back pillar, by stone bridges. The back pillar is wider than the stone which connects it to the body. The edges of the back pillar are rounded and it broadens downwards in a not quite straight line. The lines of the back pillar do not run parallel to those of the body. The torso has been carefully modelled. The musculature and bones are visible, and the kneecaps are even conspicuous. The penis has a clearly modelled head, which may be an indication of circumcision. The testes are indicated to the left and right of the penis."}
