{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86707"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with two coils of basketry on one side, and another coil at the second side, showing that this piece was positioned at the lid of a basket. The fine dark brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica. The clay was hardened after excavation, there is a crack on the surface. The front shows finger impressions as well as the impression of a scarab-like seal that was partly covered by a second impression that then was squashed almost completely by finger impressions. The seal motif consists of a circumferential band, a seated deity figure on the left, facing to the left, behind it a lying sphinx wearing a double crown and an uraeus as well as a beard, facing to the left. Behind the sphinx a cobra facing to the left holding its wings in front of it, between them a sun disc. Above and underneath it possible further illegible signs. Same seal as used on EA86700.
