During his reign, artists did not follow the older idealistic forms in rendering the features of the royal sculptures, but showed a tendency towards more realistic, mostly exaggerated features. The king was no more considered to be a divinity, but a human being. This is reflected in the king's face, which has wrinkles, a pouting mouth and a protruding chin. All these show old age, a serious nature and weariness. On his head he wears the pleated linen royal headdress with the uraeus, or royal serpent, protecting his brow. His ears are relatively large and his small eyes are hidden beneath the heavy eyebrows. The uraeus and the nose are almost completely broken"}
