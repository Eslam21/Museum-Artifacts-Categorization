", " Gorton considers this scarab to be either a genuine Hyksos-style scarab or a late imitation of this style (Gorton 1996, 16-19, type V, see especially no. 4 for this specimen), but a Hyksos date seems too early. Bes is depicted in a variety of compositions on several scarabs and scaraboids in steatite from Naukratis (instead of the tied prisoners, Bes is flanked by worshipping monkeys on Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.1043 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.676). Each of these motifs is particularly typical of the Ramesside Period (see the comment in Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 1366, n. 868). Though such compositions were found in later contexts (at Matmar, in the cemetery of the Third Intermediate Period: Brunton 1948, pl. LXIII no. 108), it is possible that they are rather genuine Ramesside scarabs/scaraboids (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). The scarabs BM 1853,0108.85 and BM 1848,0829.201, as well as various other New Kingdom examples listed by Jaeger, show a similar motif to this specimen (Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 1407, ill. 613).
