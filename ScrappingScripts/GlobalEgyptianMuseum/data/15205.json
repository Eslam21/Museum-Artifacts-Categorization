{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 264", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "32.6 cm", "Name": "Statue of Isis with Horus", "Description": "The traditional image of the goddess Isis nursing the god Horus, seen as early as the Middle Kingdom, is typical of the Late Period. This is when the aspects of Isis' motherhood and powers of protection were emphasized. Considered benevolent, strong, and able to overcome danger, her personality certainly influenced the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. In this statue, Isis is seated on a throne in a long tunic with her feet resting on a small base. She wears a wig on which rests a headdress with a frieze, or decorative band, of uraei, or royal cobras. This is topped with a sun disk between two cow's horns. The young god Horus is nude. He sits sideways on the legs of his mother who supports his shoulders as he nurses from her left breast."}
