It is essentially a detailed study of the trees at the top of the composition, but the Holy Family are also worked into the composition. It is notably one of the most detailed studies of trees that Claude made across his career but it is likely that it was not made from nature given the foliage\u2019s artful artificiality. Claude continued to develop the composition from this study, moving around the setting of the temple and addigin further details to the foreground. It is also notable for its demonstration of the delicacy with which Claude handled black chalk, which should be compared with a contemporary drawing in the BM, for which see Oo,7.182. Lit.: A.M.
