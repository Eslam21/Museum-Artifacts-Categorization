{"artifact_name": "strap", "Object Type": ["strap"], "Museum number": ["EA78245"], "Description": [" Two fragments of a very dark brown, plaited strap made of goat hair. The first fragment is the total width of the strap.The plait consists of 15 warps lying side by side. Each warp strand is made of two 'z'-plied yarns 's'-twisted together. The first warp on the left edge is used as a weft, going over 2 warps then under one. When it reaches the right edge, it becomes a passive warp again. The second warp repeats the pattern as a weft, running over 2 warps then under one, until it becomes a passive warp again at the right edge. The sequence is repeated for the length of the strap and repeated when the first warp returns to the left edge. The pattern produces an uneven twill. The ends of the strap are not preserved.
