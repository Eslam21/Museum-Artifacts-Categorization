They called it Bastet and its main cult center was at Bubastis (modern Zagazig in the eastern part of the Nile Delta). The cat was also the patron deity of the Memphite necropolis at Saqqara, and a great temple and underground mausoleum for cats was excavated at the edge of the necropolis. Mummified cats were placed in coffins and pious worshippers dedicated many bronze figures of the cat. Bastet was also the goddess of feasts, wine drinking, dancing, and music. She was assimilated with the goddesses Tefnut and Sekhmet, and was considered to be the daughter of the sun god Re. In this aspect, she was depicted with the head of a lioness. When the Romans came to Egypt, they became cat lovers, and took live cats and cat statues to Europe. This statue of Bastet shows the goddess in characteristic Egyptian style. She sits with her forelegs upright, and her hind legs neatly folded under her. The ears are erect, and the eyes are big. The muzzle has some detail and the body appears to be strong."}
