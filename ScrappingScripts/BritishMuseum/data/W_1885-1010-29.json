{"artifact_name": "plaque; figure", "Object Type": [" plaque ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["E16026"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure plaque of an Egyptian goddess. It has a triangular, or possibly curved, pediment above an architrave supported by two Bes figures standing on an Egyptian-style gate with a broken lintel with cavetto cornices. Each Bes is naked, with his hands on his thighs; their short feathered crowns rise up to the architrave of the shrine: the feathers appear to have been defined, but are damaged. Within the shrine stands a naked female deity, with her hands hanging by her sides, pressed against her thighs. She wears a very short wig, with two rows of locks across her forehead, and locks are also indicated at the sides of her head. She stands on a projecting ledge. The back is pared flat and the edges are knife-trimmed. Much of the pediment and part of the architrave are lost, and the left-hand Bes is damaged. Pressed into a one-piece plaster mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with a thin orange to brown core; traces of an overall orange slip. A large lump of previously fired clay has been accidentally incorporated at the rear bottom.

Purchased by Greville J. Chester. Said, probably erroneously, to have been acquired at Palmyra. Dated by Bailey to the Late period or Ptolemaic period (Bailey 2008, no. 3109). A similar piece from a different mould series was also purchased by the British Museum from Rev Greville John Chester in 1885, that was thought to be Phoenician from Palmyra and dated to early 4th century BC (British Museum ME 1885,1010.28). Rev Greville John Chester also visited and acquired objects from the Nile Delta in the same trip as he visited Palmyra and as that example is also made of Nile silt, a Naukratis provenance is more likely, though other Nile Delta sites cannot be excluded. There is a cruder figure in plain shrine also thought to be from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1896-1908.E4679). Similar limestone carving dated Saite to beginning of the Ptolemaic period, with the shrine supported by Hathor-columns, with Bes-figures on high pedestals flanking the goddess (von Bissing 1931, 18, points out that this type of wig was most popular in Saite times). Another small limestone relief from Tell el-Yahudiya in the British Museum, (BM 1875,0517.100) is similar, but has papyrus-columns, and the figure of the goddess stands between a gate with a broken lintel, which supports sistrum-like Hathor-capitals. Hathor-capitals are also found on a limestone shrine from Athribis, from a late third to 2nd century BC context (My\u015bliwiec 1996b, 10, fig. 2). Several figures from Mendes are similar, some within a shrine, from 4th to 3rd century BC context (Redford 1988, 67, pl. 22d). Various similar examples (Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie Museum UC50489), including one dated Late Period and early Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 203). The shrine compares with a probably 3rd to 2nd century BC example with Bes-pillars and lions (or sphinxes), but with Athena in the temple (LIMC iii (2): pl. 77:22). Fischer, J. 1994.
