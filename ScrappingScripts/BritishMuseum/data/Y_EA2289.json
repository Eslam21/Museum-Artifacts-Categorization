{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2289"], "Description": [" Head of a green basalt male figure, broken from the neck. He has a shaven head with subtle modelling of the skull. His ears are oversized and simplistically formed, and appear to be pinned far back from the face. His eyes are extremely narrow with a heavy upper eyelid, and a faint arched ridge above indicating the eyebrows. His nose is broad at the tip, with a deep line on either side of the nose conveying a small fold of flesh. His lips are pursed together and the outer corners of the mouth are flat. His cheeks and jawline are fleshy, and the chin appears to be raised creating the suggestion of an upward gaze. There are numerous small chips across the head and face. The object is now attached to a small modern base.
