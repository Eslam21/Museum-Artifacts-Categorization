{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86893"], "Description": [" 'Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a slightly convex surface, maybe from a leather bag. An impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.3 cm is visible in the break. The upper side is flat at the top and bends down towards the sides. At the flat part about three quarters of a seal-impression is preserved with few finger impressions around it. Visible is a fine circumferential line, a standing king wearing the atef-crown, with hands crossed in front of the chest, holding a flagellum and a HKA-sceptre in each hand, facing to the left. At the bottom before and behind him cartouches, the one behind him shows (Mn-[kheper]-R')|. Two winged uraei in front and behind the figure in gesture of protection. Above them very small illegible hieroglyphs. Same motif as EA86813.
