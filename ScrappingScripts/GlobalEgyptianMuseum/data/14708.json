The face looks fleshy and smooth, the head is somewhat turned toward the left side, and the hair is shaped with great detail. The hair is that of a young man with progressive tufts, four of them fall on the top of the forehead, and one is twisted on each side of the face. Generally the hairstyle tends to flow from right to the left side of the head. The thick beard blends with the hair and is somewhat in the shape of a snake. The mustache is similarly shaped. Both hair and mustache are not refined. The beard has two parts that meet beneath the chin and some of the tufts touch the neck. The nose is short, wide and broken at the bridge. It is directly linked to the forehead. The eyebrows extend from the edge of the nose. The eyes are almond-shaped, wide, and outline the pupil and iris; the lower eyelid is prominent. His features look gentle but quite weak. A noble expression prevails in this part, emphasized by a confident deep look of the eye."}
