{"artifact_name": "alabastron", "Object Type": ["alabastron"], "Museum number": ["1894,1101.96"], "Description": [" Core-formed glass alabastron. Opaque light blue and opaque orange trails, translucent cobalt blue body and handles. Body speckled with tiny opaque white spots of scum. Broad rim-disc, bevelled inward, tool-marks on upper and under surfaces; tallish neck, cylindrical within, but tapering downward on the outside; vestigial round-angled shoulder; elongated oval body with convex sides; rounded bottom. Below shoulder, two vertical ring-handles with knobbed tails, resembling duck's beaks. One handle higher than the other on body. Unmarvered orange trail round edge of lip. Another, marvered, dropped on at neck and wound down to level of handle-rings, where a light blue trail joins it and both continue together, first in a central band of zigzags and then, near bottom, in a series of straight revolutions, ending at basal angle. Core-formed; rim-disc and handles trailed on and tooled, the handles formed by drawing upward from a drop-on at bottom and folding inward over a tool to make the ring.
