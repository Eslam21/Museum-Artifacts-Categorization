{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85614"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay figurine, showing the waist to thighs of a female with very pronounced buttocks. The figure was probably in a seated posture, but leaning back quite markedly. The hips are somewhat pronounced in profile but the focus is on the buttocks projecting from the reverse face. There is no clear effort to model the waist although it is somewhat thinner than the thighs. The figure is reasonably well modelled but not entirely symmetrical. It has been formed by modelling two separate lengths of clay and joining them vertically. Unusually, no attempt has been made to smooth the clay across the join. There is a very thin ridge of clay between the two joined halves, especially visible on the back, which is perhaps the remains of mud slurry used as an adhesive. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica.
