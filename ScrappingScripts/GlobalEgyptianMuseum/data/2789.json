Wooden falcon figures were produced from the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period, to be placed on the upper side or lid of large elements in funeral equipment, including on vaulted rectangular coffins. The falcon was used to depict the celestial and far-sighted power of several gods in Egypt: in this context, the bird may refer specifically to Sokar, the funerary god whose name may survive in the Arabic placename Saqqara."}
