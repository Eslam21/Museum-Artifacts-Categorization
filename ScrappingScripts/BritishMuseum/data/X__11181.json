", " Composition comprising several dotted circles is a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 1-3; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 1-2; on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab was discovered in the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d itself with other similar scarabs. These scarabs belong to the type XXIX in Gorton 1996, which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 108-109, see especially type XXIX no. 17 for this specimen). This decoration imitates earlier designs: for some scarabs with relatively similar designs, Magnarini pointed out that they could date to the 25th-26th dynasty with an archaizing motif (Magnarini 2004, 167, 04.05).
