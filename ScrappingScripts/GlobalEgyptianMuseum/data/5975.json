{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "A 2128", "Dating": "30TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "EL-ASSASIF", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; STUCCO", "Height": "42 cm", "Name": "Statuette of the goddess Isis", "Description": "In tomb paintings, Isis is often shown together with her sister Nephthys mourning at the bier of her deceased husband Osiris. This statuette has the same motif; it is a kneeling woman in the simple archaic dress, her right hand is held close to her face, the left is held slightly forward. A blue painted wig covers the head. On her head is the hieroglyph for \"throne\". The flat base was cut from the same piece of wood as the torso. The entire statuette was then fixed to a larger base with an inscription running around the edge. The statuette is unfortunately in a rather poor condition."}
