{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2309", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED; PAINTED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "27 cm", "Width": "8 cm", "Depth": "10 cm", "Name": "The provincial governor Meri", "Description": "This statuette represents an important individual called Meri, seated on a cube-shaped seat with an inscription on its right side. As befits a provincial governor, probably under one of the kings of the 6th Dynasty, he adopts a dignified and firm attitude, with his left hand flat on his knee, and the other hand gripping an imaginary staff of authority. He wears a simple loincloth and a broad collar. His hair has a central parting which tapers until it meets his shoulders. His face is distinctive: slightly pushed back, with a broad mouth and wide open eyes, he appears to be somewhat tense. The rendition of the body with the narrow torso and heavy legs presages the statuary of the 1st Intermediate Period."}
