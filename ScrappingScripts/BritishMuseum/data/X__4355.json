This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Scarabs with a motif of papyrus thicket depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions on scarabs and scaraboids (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 4-7). This scarab was attributed to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 98-99, type XXVIII, subtype A159-166, see especially A159 for this piece). However, the rather large size of the scarab and the delicate incised outline of the motif are unlike Gorton's type XXVIII. Its size and technique recall more her type XXXIV A (Gorton 1996, 121-123).
