At its foot was a stela (1905,1014.119). The stela and altar were surrounded by an approximately circular enclosure of rough stones that extended behind the stela. In the reigns of Amenemhat III and IV such enclosures for stelae were created as secondary private cult places clustering around the main temple. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
