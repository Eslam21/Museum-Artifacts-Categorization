His private fortune combined with its innate modesty meant that he never fell the necessity to sell his paintings or lithographs, with the result that most of his works remained until recently in the possession of his family. He travelled widely, to province, Switzerland, Italy, and, above all, Egypt, where he accompanied Prosper Marilhat, his teacher. After 1857 he retired to Cherbourg where he continued to produce pastels and charcoal drawings of the Normandy countryside as well as seascapes."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 1996, BM, French Drawings from the BM, (no cat.)
