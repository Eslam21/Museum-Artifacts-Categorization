{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6368", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP IV/AMENOPHIS IV/NEFERKHEPERURE/AKHENATEN", "Archaeological Site": "EL-`AMARNA/AKHETATEN ?", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Height": "5 cm", "Name": "Terracotta head of Akhenaten", "Description": "This small terracotta head of Akhenaten exhibits all the characteristics of Amarna art. The viewer should observe the very typical face with the elongated veiled eyes, high cheekbones, fleshy mouth, and rounded elongated chin. The only unusual feature is the band around the edge of the face: does it represent the ends of a curly wig or is it a very simplified stylised version of the frizzy hair of the subject? This miniature masterpiece seems a much more personal and subtle object than the output of most of sculptural trial pieces and models which have come from the site of El-`Amarna."}
