{"artifact_name": "situla", "Object Type": ["situla"], "Museum number": ["1888,0208.7"], "Description": [" Fragments from one side of upper part of black-figure painted pottery situla. Two winged (male?) figures confronted (part of a flower appears between them); beneath the handle a vertical meander of two members: below, part of lotus flower. The paint has vanished, but there are traces of purple on wing feathers. "], "Cultures/periods": [" East Greek ", " East Dorian (?)

The style of the heads is closely paralleled on Caeretan hydriai. The figures are male rather than female, since they have short skirts and no ear-rings. For the projection in front of the chest see above on Pl. GB 585, 1-2. For the circle on the buttock note the later Clazomenian sarcophagus, Pl. GB 610. For the meander compare Pl. 603, 2. BM Cat. Vases Murray, ib., p. 67; Sikes, Nike of Archermos, p. 12. The figure much resembles the statue by Mikkiades and Archermos (Mrs. Mitchell, Hist. Ant. Sculpt., pp. 196-7), but whether it is to be considered as a Nike is doubtful; it may be merely decorative, cf. \u0392125, 2. On the other hand, it resembles the Nike crowning Europa on a Caeretan hydria, published by Jahn (Die Entfuhrung der Europa, pl. V a)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B106.3) ", " CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (Pl.
