{"artifact_name": "model", "Object Type": ["model"], "Museum number": ["EA37632"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta model of an armchair, perhaps based upon a wickerwork example, with a high plain rounded back. The seat slopes forward steeply. The chair has short stubby legs at the front, and the face is decorated with rows of ornament: a top row of interfaced triangles; a wide row with two circles divided by six-armed crosses; a third row, very obscure, but apparently a series of crossed diagonals; and a fourth row consisting of a narrow plain moulding. In the centre of the front, interrupting the second and third rows, is a large circle which might have had impressed decoration, but the details are uncertain. The back and sides of the chair are completely plain. Two-piece mould. Red-brown Nile silt, with some mica. Traces of a white dressing, mainly on the front.
