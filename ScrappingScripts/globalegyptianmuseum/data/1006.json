On his left side, he holds a casket in the form of a naos, whose roof, which serves as its lid, he raises. The piece, apparently without parallel, belongs to the classical tradition of the god Eros in the service of his mother Aphrodite. The casket probably contained the jewellery reserved for nuptial ceremonies or the ex-voto's which the bride piously kept at home."}
