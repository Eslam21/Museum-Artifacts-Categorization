The inscription is in a different position with respect to the external bands on the two sets of sherds, but this need not exclude their belonging together. It must be very likely that this is the plate described in fuller detail by Hutton, Classical Review 1893, 83 as a dedication by a Rhodian. Gardner, however, records the beginning of the name of Charmes, not in Hutton, who has nu not mu, which is not an easy mistake, unless it is a typo. Fragment b does has fresh breaks and may indicate a previously fuller state. Hutton's interpretation of the letter, now lost, as a rho, and therefore the beginning of the ethnic Rodios, must be doubted; we would expect the definite article, and \u03bf \u03a7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03bf \u03a4\u03b7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 would fit well."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 65, no. 776, pl.
