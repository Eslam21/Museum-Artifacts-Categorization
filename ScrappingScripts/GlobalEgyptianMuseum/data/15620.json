A false door allows the Ba and Ka, the soul and guardian spirit of the dead, to receive offerings and hear the prayers of the living. Here, Ishti is wearing a collar and a small false beard. Two small figures are also shown wearing starched kilts. On the lintel, the horizontal stone above the door, the Hetep-di-nisw offering formula is written for Ishti's benefit and gives his name and title."}
