{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA68398"], "Description": [" Convex fragment from the body of a vessel: in opaque white glass. The body is decorated with wide, parallel threads running at a slight diagonal in alternating dark blue and turquoise-blue; probably to be reconstructed as belonging to a complex and large-scale chevron pattern. The thick walls taper towards the upper undecorated body. Certainly from a larger than average vessel. Glossy surface. Tan core.
