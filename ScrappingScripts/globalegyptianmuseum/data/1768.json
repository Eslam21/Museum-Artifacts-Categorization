There is a decorative, rather than functional wavy handle on both sides. There are remains of the original contents, aromatic fat placed in the grave for the use of the deceased in life after death. The vessel was found in one of the fourth millennium BC graves at the key early settlement near Kom el-Ahmar (the Hierakonpolis of later texts) in southern Upper Egypt. From this and other burial goods in the rich tomb, the burial can be dated to the end of the Naqada II Period, on the eve of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in the final stage of state formation. During this period Kom el-Ahmar was a major centre of the emerging Egyptian kingship. "}
