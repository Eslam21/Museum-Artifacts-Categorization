The king wears the long royal beard and a coiled uraeus over a wig cover. The lower part of a cartouche is visible. The sculptor has obviously changed his mind about the position of the arms; a previous outline can clearly be seen, but this would have been covered by a layer of plaster and paint when the relief was finished."}
