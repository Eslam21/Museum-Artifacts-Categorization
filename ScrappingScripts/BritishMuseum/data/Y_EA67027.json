{"artifact_name": "jar", "Object Type": ["jar"], "Museum number": ["EA67027"], "Description": [" Fragmentary jar with pointed base: the wreck of a fine piece. The shape, directly copied from pottery wine jars, was popular late in the Eighteenth Dynasty. The opaque light turquoise-blue field is decorated in a flowing festoon pattern in white and yellow bordered at its upper level with a white and a yellow thread. Both the shoulder and the rim are encircled with a prefabricated twisted cord in yellow and black (?). The original surface was probably glossy. On the neck a chevron pattern in opaque white and yellow. The sole remaining handle is in opaque black glass overlaid with threads of opaque white and yellow. The body is very incompletely preserved.
