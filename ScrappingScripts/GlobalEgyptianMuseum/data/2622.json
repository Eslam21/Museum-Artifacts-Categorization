{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1914:208", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-SHEIKH `ABADA/ANTINOOPOLIS", "Category": "SHOE", "Material": "LEATHER", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Width": "9 cm", "Name": "Leather shoe", "Description": "Well-preserved shoe of leather, with separate sole and upper sewn together, and cord for tying. Leather shoes began to replace reed sandals in the fourth century AD, part of a general change in which traditional Egyptian customs and products were gradually superseded by foreign, mainly Western Asiatic and Greek culture. This example comes from the only city founded in Egypt by the Romans, Antinoopolis in Middle Egypt, created by the emperor Hadrian at the site where his lover Antinous drowned in AD 130. In the Byzantine Period the city was capital of the province of Upper Egypt, and therefore at the forefront of changes in material culture."}
