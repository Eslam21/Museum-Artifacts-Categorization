{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86735"], "Description": [" Very small fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows flat area with wood impressions, a second side shows a string impression. The front has parts of an oval scarab-like impression preserved. Finger impressions on top of the seal impression distort the motif slightly but it seems to shows a kheper in the middle with an upright cobra (?) to the right of it, facing inwards.
