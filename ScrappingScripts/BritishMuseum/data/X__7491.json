", " The exterior and interior surfaces of the sherd were burnt during the bombings in London in 1941. Cook notes that according to Payne the curved line may be the end of a lion's tail held by Artemis Potnia Theron, who is not preserved on the sherd; the female figure would be a votary. He also suggests the animal at the bottom of the sherd is a goat but the remaining features are more typical of hounds. Female figures are not frequently found on Fikellura vases, nor are white dotted hems typical.
