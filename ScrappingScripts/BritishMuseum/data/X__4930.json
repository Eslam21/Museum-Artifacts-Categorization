", " 'The fragment preserves the head of a bull, probably forming part of the decoration of a wall. There are traces of fillets or ribbons bound round both its horns and probably the fragment formed part of a bull's-head-and-garland motif such as that met with on 71 and 72 above. In Egypt, as in most of the eastern provinces, this form of decoration is by no means confmed to the Hellenistic period but persists throughout Imperial times. The present fragment is identical in material and pigmentation with 179 above. Also, such stylistic details as are comparable (e.g. the rendering of the eyes) seem closely similar. It thus seems quite likely that both pieces are of the same date and may well have formed part of the same system of decoration. Egyptian work, probably of Imperial date' (Buddle and Nicholls 1967, no.180, pl.60).
