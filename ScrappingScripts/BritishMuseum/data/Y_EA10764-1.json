Papyrus written on the recto in hieratic script, while the verso is blank. The recto contains a magical text, possibly related to love-spells. The text is written in horizontal lines and there are traces of ruled lines. This frame contains Fragment A and four other fragments. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
