{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1978.291.313", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HOUSE (MODEL)", "Material": "CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Name": "House model", "Description": "Model houses such as this were placed in the tomb to provide a dwelling place for eternity. This soul house was probably based on the home of a peasant farmer. The living quarters are at one end of a yard enclosed by a mud-brick wall, stairs lead to the roof where the family would sleep in the summer, the grain storage bins were also kept here. Everyday domestic work was carried out in the open air and troughs, querns and pounders can be seen in the courtyard. Models such as this can provide us with valuable information about Egyptian domestic architecture, especially when compared to models of the homes of the elite landowners. Such architectural detail is otherwise scarce."}
