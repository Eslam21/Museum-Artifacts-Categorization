He has feminine breasts and his phallus emerges from below his garment and rests on the plinth. But for his side-lock he is shaven, and has lotus buds on top of his head, held by a knotted ribbon. Back unmodelled; circular vent in a slight depression. Two-piece mould. Very micaceous brown Nile silt; traces of an overall white dressing. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Roman Period (?)
