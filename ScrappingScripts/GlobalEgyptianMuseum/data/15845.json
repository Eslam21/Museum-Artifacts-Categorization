The block once formed part of the chapel built by King Seti the First at Memphis. This attribution was affirmed by the presence of the king's name, Men-maat-Ra. The goddess portrayed in the scene wears a long wig, topped by a uraeus-headed vulture headdress and two horns flanking a sun disk. The vulture stretches its wings around the goddess' head and grasps the Shen sign in its claws. The decoration of the chapel shows Seti the First being nursed by both Isis and Nephthys."}
