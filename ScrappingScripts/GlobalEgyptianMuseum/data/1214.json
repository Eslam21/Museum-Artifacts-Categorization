{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7122", "Dating": "PREDYNASTIC PERIOD (not before); EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD ?; OLD KINGDOM (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET ?", "Material": "LIMESTONE ?", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Amulet representing a man of thickset build", "Description": "This small object, which was part of the Lunsingh Scheurleer collection, is very particular. It represents a man of stocky build. The head is the only part of the body which has been elaborated: wearing a head-dress (?), it bears cuts suggesting the eyes, the nose and the mouth. The right arm seems to be folded against the belly. The figurine is distinguished even more by the presence of a suspension hole which is found beneath the pointed beard which the person wears. This detail maybe allows us to suppose that the object constituted a sort of amulet."}
