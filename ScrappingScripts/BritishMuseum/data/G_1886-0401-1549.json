The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds of the Grand Style. The male figures portrayed on vases here are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. Finally, there is a clumsy attempt at creating some perspective. However, it is unlikely that this sherd belongs to the group as there is no evidence for filling ornament. Typically of this early Grand Style is the use of outline when depicting male characters, but the male figure on this sherd has coloured skin, a feature commonly found in later examples of the Grand Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
