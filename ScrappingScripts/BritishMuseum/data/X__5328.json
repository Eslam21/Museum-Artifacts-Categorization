", " Several votive boxes for eels were discovered in Naukratis. According to Petrie, the cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city provided thirteen of this category of votive boxes (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Eels were particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (My\u015bliwiec 1981; Weiss 2012, 267-268). They belong to the type T 5 in the typology of animal bronzes by K.
