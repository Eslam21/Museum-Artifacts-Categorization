This scaraboid is a product of the Scarab Factory (first published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 13; on the various productions of the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, see Webb forthcoming). It belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A204-212, see especially A205 for this piece). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have only some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun as suggested by Drioton (Drioton 1957, 16, no. 3; see also Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 343, pl. 86, no. 774).
