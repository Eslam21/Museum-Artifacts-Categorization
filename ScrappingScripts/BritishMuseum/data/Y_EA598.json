All representations are in sunk relief with incised texts in columns above them. On the left the workman Pashed stands with his arms raised in adoration, and behind him stands his wife M\u1e2b\u0292y-\u1ec9b with one arm raised and the other holding a vessel. In front of them is an altar heaped with offerings which stands before the seated figures of Amenhotep I and Queen Ahmose-Nefertari. A similar scene originally filled the right-hand section of the slab, but only the seated figures of the king and queen are preserved. The edges of this fragment are damaged especially in the lower left-hand corner. There are several gouges and cracks on the surface of the stone, some of which have been repaired in modern times. There are traces of red paint on the faces and bodies of the figures, on the disk of the crown of Amenhotep I on the right-hand edge, and in some of the lines between the hieroglyphs.
