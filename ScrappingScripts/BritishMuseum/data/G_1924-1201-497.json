According to Lemos, this sherd is an Mature Animal Style chalice, but she places 1924,1201.406, from the same chalice, which shows the possible representation of a warrior, in the Grand Style. The vertical dividing band decoration on both sherds is typical of the Wild Goat Style and is no longer observed in the Mature Animal Style or Grand Styles. The triple guilloche pattern is not typically seen on Grand Style vases, where decoration principally consists of human figures; and the pattern is not usually observed below the rim of vases in the Mature Animal Style either. Such heavy decoration is most usually seen on Wild Goat Style vases. The pendant roundel on 1924,1201.406 as filling ornament is no longer seen in the Grand Style, but does appear in the Mature Animal Style. Interior decoration is not seen on Wild Goat Style vases, but appears in the Mature Animal Style. Perhaps this sherd marks a transition between the Wild Goat and Mature Animal Styles and so stands out for depicting human figures earlier than normal. Some Type A kantharoi, however, do have human figures, dividing bands and interior decoration. For other Type A kantharoi, see Williams 1983, 170-1, no. 57, fig. 12.
