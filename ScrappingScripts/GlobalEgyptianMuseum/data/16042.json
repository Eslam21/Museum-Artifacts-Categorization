At the top of the panel there are three decorative units, each in the form of a small cross. Palm leaves are also distributed over the panel, four at the top and two almost in the center. The letters of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are inscribed on the panel. Traces of other letters in red can be seen. The crosses here are in the form of the Ankh, the symbol of life in ancient Egypt; these are also in red. On this panel, the sign is developed until it is in the form of the cross.This panel was found in Upper Egypt. The Ankh, as the symbol of life, always accompanied the gods in religious scenes. During some periods it was also considered to be the key to the Nile. Later, it became the symbol of Christianity. It meant that the followers of Christ were sure that Christ, although crucified at the hands of the Romans, was still alive."}
