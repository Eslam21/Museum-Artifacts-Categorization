{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA38020"], "Description": [" A composition figure of a squatting baboon: originally glazed green, although this glaze has now decayed to white or brown. The figure is well modelled with the details of the legs and face clearly shown. The forelegs are extended to hold an object of uncertain nature on the knees, the top of the object reaching up to join the chin. Its conical shape suggests that it may represent a pot closed with a mud seal. Good condition, glaze slightly flaked in parts. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 1st Dynasty (?) ", " 2nd Dynasty (?)
