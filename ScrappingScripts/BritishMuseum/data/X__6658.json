", " Original label records excavation year, register records findspot. Note that the double-sided double-eye is usually a funerary amulet, though it can occur in other contexts (in the priests quarter in Karnak for example: Masson forthcoming). Considering their context of discovery, these beads and amulet should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the McLean Museum & Art Gallery tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs and scaraboids moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Masson, A. forthcoming, Le quartier des pr\u00eatres sur la rive est du Lac Sacr\u00e9 \u00e0 Karnak.
