", " The motif displayed on this scarab does not correspond directly to any known design from the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). It could represent the divine protection over the pharaoh, or more likely be a cryptic inscription involving the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957, see especially no. 86).
