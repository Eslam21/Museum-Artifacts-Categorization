It depicts Alexander as a god, with his head tilted slightly to the right and the eyes looking to the sky. The face and back of the head were molded, while the hair and the locks that frame the face were made by hand. The summit of the head had an emblem, a symbolic object used as an identifying mark, which is now missing, and there are traces of white plaster. Probably this statuette is a small reproduction of another statue made of marble. It illustrates the influence of the cult of Alexander in the Greek world."}
