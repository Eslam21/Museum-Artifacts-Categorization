{"artifact_name": "transport amphora", "Object Type": ["transport amphora"], "Description": [" Rhodian pottery transport amphora handle, now completely disintegrated into numerous slivers; shape cannot be reconstructed, but judging from the fragments there seems to have been a fairly sharp bend in the handle. Finely porous clay with a fair amount of very small mica and small lime (? - white) inclusions, some sand(?). Of the stamp only a small portion can be reconstructed - a round stamp with rose symbol and traces of the surrounding text. Slight remains of the stamp on two other fragments, on on something that looks like a tiny sigma next to two bumps.
