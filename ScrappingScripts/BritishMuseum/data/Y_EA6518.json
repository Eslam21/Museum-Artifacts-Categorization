{"artifact_name": "textile; cloth", "Object Type": [" textile ", " cloth "], "Museum number": ["EA6518"], "Description": [" Textile fragment; long strip of linen cloth; medium-coarse quality. Undyed linen, cream to beige in places; threads naturally darker. Stained. Warp fringe (11cm) at one end, loosly twisted into groups, the edge of the cloth being roughly oversewn to prevent unravelling; starting-border and three double self-bands alternating with two red bands at opposite end. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spun and S-spliced; the stitch gauge is warp c.28 ends per 10mm and weft 10 picks per 10mm. The sewing thread is S-spun and S-spliced; overcasting at the fringe. The weft in the bands makes it unclear as to whether it was dyed, pigmented or natural.
