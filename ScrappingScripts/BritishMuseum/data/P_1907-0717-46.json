Here St Antony is in the centre; the nude female figure on the right and the one immediately behind him on the left are pulling at his cloak. This motive is found again in nos. 1907-7-17- 48, 49, 53 (where it is a beast that pulls the robe), 54-56, 60 and 61. As Rossi points out, St Antony at the centre of the composition with his cloak being pulled appears in a painting of the same subject in the Collection Harrach in Rohrau (Rossi 1999, fig. 13). There is no suggestion that these drawings are preparatory for that painting, since the composition of the latter is vertical rather than horizontal as in most of the sheets of the Guzman Album. But it has to be said that the idea of female devils is shared in both painting and drawings, although in the latter they are mainly in the nude. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907. A Title Page inscribed in brown ink is at the beginning of the series. Lit.: H. Tietze and E.
