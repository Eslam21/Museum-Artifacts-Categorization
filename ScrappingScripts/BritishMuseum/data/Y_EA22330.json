{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA22330"], "Description": [" A Samian pottery amphora made in a compact, micaceous red fabric, with a small foot (chipped) from which the concave sides widen to a rounded shoulder before converging to a cylindrical neck. At either side of this is a loop-handle and the top of the neck is finished with an everted rim. About one-third of the circumference of the rim and top of the neck is missing, part of the foot has been broken and there are two deep chips in the side of the jar. The top of one of the handles is also damaged. The exterior is covered by a cream-yellow slip. On top of the shoulder is a mark consisting of three incised lines, executed pre-firing.
