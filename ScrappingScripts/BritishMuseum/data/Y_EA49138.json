The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). Petrie does not mention any cat when he lists the various \u201cbronze boxes\u201d found in this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Petrie states the presence of four figures of cats amongst the bronze finds (Petrie 1886, 41) and 'small case with cat' in his journal (entry for March 6th 1885; Masson 2015). One of them could perhaps correspond to this votive box. Cats are usually associated with the goddess Bastet, a deity particularly revered in Lower Egypt (Weiss 2012, 297-299). Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming b).
