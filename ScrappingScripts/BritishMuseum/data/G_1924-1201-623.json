Simple Animal Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds above two white bands on the interior (Williams 1983, 169). Many kantharoi Type B have painted inscriptions beneath the rim, and they have been found on Aegina as well as at Naukratis. The number '18' and '\u03a65' are written on the exterior surface of the sherd. '18' is written on a label on the interior."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 63, no. 735, pl.
