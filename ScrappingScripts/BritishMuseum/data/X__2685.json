", " Locally made archaic type lamp, probably early Ptolemaic in date (late 4th to early 3rd century BC), but may be earlier. Close Ptolemaic parallels are published by D.M. Bailey for the British Museum (Bailey 1975, British Museum Lamps I, Q515 and Q516). Many examples from Naukratis (McLean Museum and Art Gallery, Greenock1987.381; City Art Gallery and Museum, Bristol H843.a and H843.b; Bolton Museum 1886.31.6; British Museum Q515, GR 1886, 0401.1353). Parallels from late 4th to early 3rd century graves in the Hadra cemetery, Alexandria (Breccia 1912, pl.57, 129; Adriani 1934, pl.13, 2; 1940, pl.31, 2; 1952, pl.4, 2; Bailey 1977, 244). Late 4th or 3rd century BC parallel from Alexandria (Blond\u00e9 1998, 324-5, no. 21), though this long lived form has a long history in Cyprus.
