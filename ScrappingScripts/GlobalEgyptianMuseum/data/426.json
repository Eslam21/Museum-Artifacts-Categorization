In its initial state, the kit was composed of six dummy containers, two of which were long-necked  vases, now missing, and four small vases in the form of a truncated cone, which all have survived. Two are in quartz and two others in dark limestone. In the middle, one notices the principal instrument in polished flint, in the form of a fish hook (\"pesheshkef\"), as well as a knife of dark limestone,  next to an empty space which once contained an identical example. The kit accompanied the deceased in the tomb."}
