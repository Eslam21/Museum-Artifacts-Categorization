The representations are painted in two registers.In the upper register, the owner of the coffin adores five goddesses, personifying the first five hours of the day. The textcolumn to the sixth goddess is preserved but not her image. All wear long dresses with breast straps, long wigs with fillets, collars, armlets, bracelets and anklets. They are crowned with sun disks, and face right, raising both hands. Between them are textcolumns. Shepenbastet faces left in front of the others, raising one hand. She wears the same dress and jewellery, but has a short wig without adornment. Above her head is a horizontal line of text.The lower register shows alternatingly three cheker-signs and Anubis-jackals, reclining on shrines, each holding a flail and an unidentified object.The figures are somewhat carelessly filled in with colour. A few traces of red grid lines are visible."}
