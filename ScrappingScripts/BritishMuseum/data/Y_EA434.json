{"artifact_name": "sculpture", "Object Type": ["sculpture"], "Museum number": ["EA434"], "Description": [" Limestone figures of two uraeus cobras. Both cobras wear the sun-disc crowns, and their eyes are simplistically rendered. Their hoods appear to not have any incised detail, though the lower portion of their bodies include two additional small uraeus cobra figures that wear sun-disc crowns with cow horns. Their lower bodies are raised up behind them and their tails are curled at the back. The right side cobra\u2019s lower body has been damaged at the reverse, and the back of the base is also partly missing. The surface of the limestone is heavily damaged and worn, with clear flaking across both the bodies of the cobras and across the sides of the base. The object is now supported by a thin modern base.
