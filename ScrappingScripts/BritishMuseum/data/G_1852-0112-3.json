They were widely distributed particularly in the East Greek world, including Samos, Miletos, Rhodes and Cyrene (Stucky 1974; Furtw\u00e4ngler 2011). Unworked tridacna shells are also reported among finds from the cemetery of Naukratis (Gardner 1888, 29). Most examples of worked tridacna shells have been found in sancturies of female deities, but examples are also known from female tombs on Rhodes (Filimonos-Tsopotou and Marketou 2014, 70).
