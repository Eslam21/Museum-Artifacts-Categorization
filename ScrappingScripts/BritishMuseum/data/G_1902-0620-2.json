The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
