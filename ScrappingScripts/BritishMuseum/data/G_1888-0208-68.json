{"artifact_name": "neck-amphora", "Object Type": ["neck-amphora"], "Museum number": ["1888,0208.68"], "Description": [" Fragment of Clazomenian black-figure painted pottery slim neck-amphora: naked and semi-draped male figures holding cup advance towards seated figure on right. Whole: Body, A, naked man carrying staff, man in cloak carrying cup, woman bending forward over what seems to be a smoking altar (the projections above are in dilute paint); B, two satyrs bouncing a boy or man (the support is, I think, not a hand): dividing band of white dots with dark centres: birds feeding (there were originally five): on the dark paint two bands of purple. On those folds of man's cloak where there are not white dots, purple dots (first, third, and fifth folds) or solid purple (second and fourth folds): purple stripe in second or third compartment of wing of birds. The two fragments of Plate GB 584.1 (the larger is GR 88.2-8.68 = B.115.2, the smaller 88.2-8.70f) are isolated, but can be assigned to the same pot as the other fragments by the curve and thickness of the wall and by the wheel-marks. Plate GB 584.1 shows clearly vertical streaks made before firing, perhaps in applying the peptized coating.
