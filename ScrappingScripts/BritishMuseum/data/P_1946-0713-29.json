Fitzroy Phillipps Fenwick of Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham', I, London, 1935, p. 85, no. 3 (as Attributed to Pordenone; amended to Gatti on p. 242); A.E. Popham, 'Italian drawings in the BM, Artists working in Parma in the Sixteenth Century', London, 1967, I, no. 34, II, pl. 27 Popham 1967 This drawing, previously attributed to Correggio, appeared in the Fenwick Collection Catalogue under a tentative attribution to Pordenone; but in the 'addenda' (p. 242) it was given to Gatti on the strength of its resemblance to studies in the Uff\u00eczi for his fresco in S. Pietro, Cremona. This attribution was confirmed by the subsequent identification of the drawing as a study for one of the Apostles painted round the drum of the cupola of S. Maria della Steccata, Parma (Popham, 'Correggio', fig. 56). Gatti was working on the cupola of the Steccata from 1560 to 1572. The painting of the lower register presumably dates from the end rather than the beginning of this period.
