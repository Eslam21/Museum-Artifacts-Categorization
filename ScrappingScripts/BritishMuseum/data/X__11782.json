XVIII, no. 40. This scaraboid belongs to a type produced at Naukratis and widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, Type XXVIII B, subtype B140-147, see especially B142 for this piece; on the various productions of the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, see Webb forthcoming). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun, and notably on the sw-plant sign used with the value of 'n' in trigrams of Amun: Drioton 1957, 16).
