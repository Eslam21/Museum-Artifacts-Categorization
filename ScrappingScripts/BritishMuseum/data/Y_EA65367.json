The paint is streaky. The decoration is identical on the two sides: a boat with many oars, but unusually there is no space between the oars below the two central cabins. An elaborate standard of curved elements is appended to the right cabin; a thick frond is placed on the left prow. Below each boat is a motif which appears to be an unparalleled alternative to the usual skin on a pole (see Graff 2009 motif P1.p). Spikey zig-zag lines appear over the handles instead of the usual wavy lines. Below the handles are Naqada plants, beside each of which is a zig-zag line. The base is unpainted. There are a number of irregular features on this vessel that might place the authenticity of its decoration in question. The rim is chipped. Published: G.
