Three fragments of a Late Period figure of the same style and possibly from the same figure were found near the north side of the Great Temenos by Hogarth in \u20186th century' BC levels (Cairo CG32802; CG32801; CG32803; Hogarth, Lorimer & Edgar 1905, 131-2, fig. 11). Although this was interpreted as female by Edgar (see Dafana parallel (GR 1906, 0301.4), the head is bald, as per other male figures. A number of similar hand- made pieces were found at Naukratis (Amsterdam, Allard Pierson Museum 7473; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1847; A.1848; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.469; 86.468; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2800, H2256; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4719). Some of these examples still possessed their original Egypt Exploration fund labels, stating 'Naukratis 580 BC\u2019 suggesting that these were commonly found in late 6th century BC contexts. Similar pieces were found by Petrie at Memphis in late period contexts (Petrie Museum UC48478- 9; UC8928, UC48429, UC47823, UC47832; Petrie 1909a, pl. 43, no. 68, pl. 44 top right; Petrie 1909b, pl. 28, no. 70-71, pl.29, no. 85, see also pl. 32, no. 113 and pl. 34, nos 125-6, 131; Petrie 1910, see pl. 45, nos 178-9).
