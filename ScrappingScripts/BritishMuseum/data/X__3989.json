{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a female worshipper standing. She is wearing a plain chiton. The smooth skirt broadens towards the bottom and has an arched lower border opening towards the top. The back of the border is left longer. The sides are bevelled. The naked feet are standing horizontally, close to one another, in the centre of the octagonal plinth projecting far to the front. The back is slightly curved (the cross-section is approximately lentoid) and roughly rendered. The artist tried to create an impression of depth through the slightly elongated hemline at the back. The polygonal plinth has been carefully finished. Lower body fragment with plinth. The frontal area of the plinth is chipped. Rootlets; left of the feet not cleaned. Carved from white limestone.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This is one of the few figures which due to their state of preservation can be ascribed with certainty to the group of female statuettes wearing a long and simple garment corresponding to Yon's type I - just as (Nick 2006, no. 23, London B452 ; no.24, Oxford G1022). Similar to Oxford G 1022. Nick argues this figure should be relatively late within Yon's type I based upon the style (Nick 2006, 57- 60, 114, pl. 13, no. 25). Likely from Petrie's excavations in the sanctuary of Aphrodite, or the area of the town adjacent to the sanctuaries of Apollo and Hera. No precise contextual information is recorded. Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
