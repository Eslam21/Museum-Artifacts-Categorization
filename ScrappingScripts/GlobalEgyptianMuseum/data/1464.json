{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8419", "Dating": "20TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK ?", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "22.3 cm", "Name": "Shabti of Amenmose", "Description": "This wooden funerary statue belongs to a category of relatively rare shabti. It is covered with a thin layer of stucco painted in different colours. The person wears a long wig held by a band. A large necklace entirely conceals the chest and a part of the arms. The edge is emphasised by two large ribbons falling on both sides of the body. The statuette bears a vertical inscription mentioning the title and the name of the owner: \"the chief guardian of the public accounts of the domain of Amun, Amenmose\". The person is also known by the shabti preserved at the Museum of Berlin (Inv. 10785), but it is not sure that it is identical to the owner of the papyrus from the British Museum 10.068 who lived during the reign of Ramesses IX."}
