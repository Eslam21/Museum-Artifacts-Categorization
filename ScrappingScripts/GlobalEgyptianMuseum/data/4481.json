A central panel shows the mummy lying on a bier, at either side is another panel containing a winged figure accompanied by Thoth, an udjat-eye alongside. Below all of these scenes are short lines of text, the third vignette shows the solar bark containing the figure of Re-Harakhty, worshipped at left and right by four badly damaged figures, probably the four Sons of Horus.
