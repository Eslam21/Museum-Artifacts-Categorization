{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 61052", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "FEMALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Mummy of Meritamun", "Description": "Queen Meritamun's mummy was buried in two cedarwood coffins and a cartonnage outer case, which is now damaged. Cartonnage is linen or papyrus held together by glue and molded into coffins. The tomb, in antiquity, had been robbed and apparently the mummy was plundered. Nevertheless, during the Twenty-First Dynasty, the tomb was restored and the mummy was rewrapped. When scholars unwrapped the mummy, the queen was found to have wavy brown hair. From examination it appears that she may have died in her fifties, possibly because of scoliosis, from which she suffered in her last days. Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine."}
