{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86690"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, with a convex rear, showing traces of a surface, maybe a leather bag or similar, with some finger prints at the edge of it, perpendicular to this another side with deep impressions of turned cord. The object was hardened after excavation, the substance was not dispensed very well and left stains on the surface. The top shows the half of an impression of a sharp cut scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal itself is only preserved in its upper half, showing a circumferential line and originally three registers, of which two are preserved. Each shows a row of seated deities. The upper one starts left with a sA-sign, then Seth facing left and behind him a deity with a sun discand the moon crescent (Khonsu?). The second register shows another seated deity with a beard, facing to the right, in front of it remains of a khpr in the middle. The same motif can be found on EA86951 and EA86952. Here the second row shows a seated deity at the end of the second row, facing to the left. The third row shows two sA-signs at the outer parts and another sign (dj?) in the middle.
