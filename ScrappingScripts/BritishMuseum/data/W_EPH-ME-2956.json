Message continues from another card and reads: \"whist drive last night which went off splendidly - much better than I thought it would. Next Friday we are having Bridge instead. Today is Saturday & I am sending into Ismailia & there I hope [this] will be posted there. The News still seems to be good from France doesn't it? What do people think about it in England. We are getting in ecstasy over it out here. Food seems to be dear & scarce at home. You will all have to come out here. Milo\".
