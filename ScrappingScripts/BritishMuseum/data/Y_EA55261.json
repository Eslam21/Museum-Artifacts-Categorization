{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA55252"], "Description": [" Fragmentary red granite head of a male official, the body and base now lost. The figure is depicted with a receding hairline, with closely cropped and thick curled hair at the top and sides of the head and notable modelling of the skull particularly around the forehead. The almond shaped eyes are detailed with a thin incised rim around the upper eyelid, and set underneath the deeply defined ridges of the arched eyebrows. There is a discernible furrowing of the figure\u2019s brow emphasised by the crease at the bridge of the nose. The face is fleshy with notable ridges of skin around the nose and mouth area, and is particularly rounded at the jawline. The mouth is small with thick lips and the outer corners are curved slightly into a small smile. On the reverse, a fragment likely from the top of a back-pillar is partly preserved at the base of the figure\u2019s neck. The lower right side of the nose is damaged, and there are small abrasions across the stone surface at the figure\u2019s ears and mouth, with small chips also visible along the forehead and chin.

An example of this can be seen here with the use of the Greek curled hairstyle, which has led to suggestions that this head is an example of an individualised portrait from the Ptolemaic Period (though differing suggestions include \u2018early-mid\u2019 Ptolemaic, PM VIII; or late Ptolemaic, Russmann 2001). \u2018Portrait heads\u2019 of other non-royal male figures also include similar indications of an older age through the additional details of wrinkles and folds of the skin; later collectors often removed these heads from the original bodies as they valued the \u2018Roman\u2019 appearance of such sculpture (Russmann 2001). The provenance of the head, said by the owner to have originated from Tell Basta in Lower Egypt, has been questioned in other sources (Russmann 2001: 259, n.1). Further Bibliography: G.
