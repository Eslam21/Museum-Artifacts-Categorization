{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA62580"], "Description": [" One head bead and three glass beads. A head bead of cylindrical form representing a black African in opaque bright-blue glass. The large eyes are formed from circles of white glass with the bright-blue pupils in high relief. The heavy lips are of white glass. The ears are represented, one now missing, by a loop of bright-blue glass; a blob of white below is presumably an earring. A suspension loop on top of the head is in opaque bright-blue glass. Thick brown core. The beads found with the head bead are 'eye-beads' with blue and white 'eyes' on a black ground. Glossy surface.
