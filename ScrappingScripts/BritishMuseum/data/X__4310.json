", " Since only a fragment of this crown is preserved, it is difficult to identify the god represented. It possibly belongs to a figure of Osiris since Osiris bronzes were common in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). The Osirian cult is important in the saite nome, and particularly in Sais itself as stressed by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 445), but also on a more local scale (Masson 2015).
