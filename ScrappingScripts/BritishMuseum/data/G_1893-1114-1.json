{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1893,1114.1"], "Description": [" Mould-made pottery lamp with a rectangular body: six wick-holes along front edge, two on each short side. Tendrils at rear corners, comic masks at front corners. The handle is in the form of a reclining lion. The scene on top is of a a healing shrine, perhaps the Serapeum at Canopus; near the centre, a dwarf-like naked man stands at the door of a building, reached by a flight of steps. The building has a pediment, supported by two lotus columns; in its side wall are two semi-circular windows. The doorman greets a heavily draped woman, who is accompanied by a slave carrying a child. Behind the slave two draped figures are shown close together; one is possibly carrying the other. Nearby is an altar, with horned corners and columns below, and it has relief figures on the sides. On the left of the scene, a figure leans out of one of the windows; below, a saddled horse is grazing, behind which is a man in a short tunic, who stands shading his eyes with his right hand. Rectangular raised base. Brown clay with mica covered with red-brown slip on upper side. Plaster mould.
