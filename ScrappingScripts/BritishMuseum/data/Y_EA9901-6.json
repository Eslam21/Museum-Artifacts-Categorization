Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Sheet composed of 31 lines of black and red cursive hieroglyphic text with black dividing lines. Above the text is a polychrome vignette in a band at the top. Spell 17 continued. Vignette depicts a seated deity associated with Osiris; the deceased in adoration in front of a heron standing before an offering table; a mummy on a bier flanked by Isis and Nephthys in vulture form, with a seated deity to the left; the deceased offering to two snakes on standards; and two deities one of them is Nefertem. The composition is framed by double black/yellow line at bottom. Short black cursive hieroglyphic captions are by the deceased, mummy, heron and snakes. ", " Tarasenko, Mykola. 2016.
