{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA35361"], "Description": [" Fragmentary white quartz seated figure of a king, the upper body now lost. The figure sits on a smooth block throne and wears a short shendyt kilt, with both hands placed across the thighs. The broad lower legs are positioned close together and the feet are carefully rendered. Across the top of the base just in front of the right foot is a very slim surviving section of incised text with an epithet referencing the god Sobek. The throne is heavily damaged on the left side at both corners and extending onto the base at both the front and back. There are chips to the body across the right side kilt and left hand and forearm.

This was a deity particularly associated with Amenemhat III, and may also support a possible Fayum provenance for this piece (Haney 2020). It is noted that the text appears to be inscribed within a cartouche as opposed to in a more conventional horizontal line of text defined by a border, for which there is no surviving comparable example within Amenemhat\u2019s known representations (Haney 2020).
