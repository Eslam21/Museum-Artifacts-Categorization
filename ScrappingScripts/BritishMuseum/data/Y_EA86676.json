{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86676"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression showing two rows of basketry coil impressions at the rear and at the side a further part with little traces of further basketry but also an impression of a flat plant part. The clay was hardened after excavation before the object was properly cleaned, therefore parts of the impression are not recognizable. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles. The front shows the lower halves of two impressions of a scarab-like seal and some finger impressions around them. The seal impressions show a bird on the right, facing left, in front of it a rectangular sign over the full height of the seal and a smaller sign left of it. Very similar to EA86673, EA86674 and EA86675, same motif as EA86679.
