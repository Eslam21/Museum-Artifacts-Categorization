{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 18220", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "FLAX", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Christian Mummy", "Description": "The mummy dates back to the Christian era, proving that mummification occurred then even though it contradicted the new religion's beliefs in a heavenly afterlife. The person who mummified this individual burnt a cross on the chest as proof of his Christianity. The mummy supports the idea that in the early period of Christianity, people were still influenced by the burial methods of the Pharaohs. Certain corpses were mummified, but they remained rare exceptions. The method to wrap the mummies differed in the Christian era from that used by the Pharaohs. Christian ribbons, to facilitate the shaping of a cross, were used instead of the Pharaonic bandages. Mummification lasted until the seventh century."}
