{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86165"], "Description": [" Scarab made of a white pebble with incised lines filled with glazed dark brown to black material. This is a very unusual piece, very thin with both sides showing the back of the scarab, no base with seal is preserved, no sides are indicated either. The area of the head is very unusual as well. The division between head and prothorax is not clearly shown. The division between prothorax and elytra is shown by a single line with the humeral callosities shown with a wavy line. The suture is shown by a single line as well, getting divided into a triangle at its lower end. The head is not indicated directly but indirectly by leaving a gap between two very large and round eyes, outside of them a short bent line is found from one end to the other, being glazed only at the outer ends and in a short central part. The clypeus as well as the plates are not shown at all.
