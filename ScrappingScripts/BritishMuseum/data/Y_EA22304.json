{"artifact_name": "jar", "Object Type": ["jar"], "Museum number": ["EA22304"], "Description": [" A small Bes-jar of coarse red siltware pottery, with a blunt pointed base and convex sides. The narrow mouth is surrounded by a short, cylindrical neck, which was finished with a slightly flared rim. The rim has been broken and all the original top edge is missing. The coarse fabric shows voids from burned-out straw. On the exterior is a red slip, worn off in places. The side of the vase is decorated with a very abbreviated Bes-face, formed of applied blobs of clay for the ears and eyes, the latter set in a slight depression.
