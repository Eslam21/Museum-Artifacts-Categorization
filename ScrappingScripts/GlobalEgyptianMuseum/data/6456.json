{"Present location": "INSTITUT DE PAPYROLOGIE ET D'\u00c9GYPTOLOGIE, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LILLE III [02/049] LILLE", "Inventory number": "L 1667", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "MIRGISSA", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "ENGRAVED; PAINTED; INCISED", "Height": "49 cm", "Width": "31 cm", "Depth": "7 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "The text of this stela has entirely disappeared and only a few neb signs (\"lord, all, every\") can still be read in the lunette of the stela. The decoration is located in two sections. The lunette or upper section and body of the stela are separated by a wide band (originally dark blue?). In the lunette, three barely identifiable deities are depicted seated, facing a small offering table. They appear to be, from left to right, Hathor, who was worshipped at Mirgissa/Iken, Montu, wearing a solar disc flanked by two horns and mounted with two tall plumes, and a deified king wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt.  In the lower section, the dedicator (?) and his family are depicted facing the opposite direction. From left to right, the first person appears to be the dedicator of the stela, leaning towards a large vase. He is followed by a man who might be carrying a fan (a standard bearer ?) and two women, the first one wearing a long flowing, wavy-hemmed cloak. Whereas the gestures of the figures can still be more or less identified, there are no details left identifying what they are actually holding nor are there any legible elements of their names, except for the beginning of the phrase \"his daughter\" above the cloaked lady."}
