{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8050", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP IV/AMENOPHIS IV/NEFERKHEPERURE/AKHENATEN", "Archaeological Site": "EL-`AMARNA/AKHETATEN ?", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "5 cm", "Width": "5.5 cm", "Depth": "5.5 cm", "Name": "Head of a shabti of Akhenaten", "Description": "This head of a shabti displays all the features of the face of Akhenaten. It wears the 'afnet' hair style, a head cover which expands into a round bag-shape at the back of the head and normally furnished with an end piece which is not present in this example. The head of the large uraeus is also missing. Shabtis found in the tomb of Akhenaten at El -`Amarna show that these funerary statuettes no longer bore the text of chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead. This change is consistent with the innovative theology of the 'heretic king', who refrained from all mentions of Osiris, the god of the Hereafter par excellence."}
