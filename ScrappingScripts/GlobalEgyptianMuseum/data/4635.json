{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "14", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTOR'S MODEL ?", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED ROCK", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; CARVED", "Height": "11.3 cm", "Width": "9.5 cm", "Depth": "6.2 cm", "Name": "Face of a statue", "Description": "The head is missing behind the ears and the lower ends of the head-dress are also broken off. The face has weak rounded features. The shape of the piece suggests that it is a sculptor's model or a votive offering. A half-length or long wig probably covered the head, certainly not a royal headcloth or Nemes. \u00c3\u201eOS 14 is therewith a rare example of a sculptor's model of a non-royal person."}
