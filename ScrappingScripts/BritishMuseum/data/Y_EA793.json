{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA793"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Nebdjefau: the scene on this round-topped stela is carved in sunk relief. Osiris is depicted standing on the left. He is being worshipped by the royal scribe and overseer of the granaries of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nebdjefau, who stands on the right. Between them lies an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Four vertical columns of hieroglyphs incised above Nebdjefau contain a prayer to Osiris on his behalf, while a single horizontal line of text incised at the bottom of the stela gives his name and titles. The stela is in an excellent state of preservation apart from a few scratches and a covering of small black smudges. There are no traces of colour.
