", " This scaraboid is on display in the Museum of Fine Arts and was photographed through glass. The label reports that the device represents a 'lion with crescent moon above'. It can be identified as Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 60. Winged mythological creatures are commonly depicted on scarabs and scaraboids at Naukratis (on this production, see Webb forthcoming). This piece belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-103, 106-107, Type XXVIII A, subtype A116-117, but see A115 for this piece wrongly identified as a Bes head scaraboid). For rather similar African head scaraboids from Naukratis see for example: Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no.100 (BM 1886,0401.1666.A) and 145 (BM 1886,0401.1693); Gardner 1888, pl.
