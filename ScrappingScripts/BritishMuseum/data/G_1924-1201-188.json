Lemos describes the sherd as part of the Group of the Aphrodite Bowl because the sherd displays a greater amount of variety in the filling ornaments, similar to those on the Aphrodite Bowl (Lemos 1991, 74-5). The addition of this sherd to the rest of the phallus cup led Williams to describe the cups as belonging to one of the mature works of the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl (Williams 2006a, 128). The shape of the vessel suggests that the cup was probably a dedication to Aphrodite. For a discussion of the shape, see Williams, 2006a, pp. 127-8.
