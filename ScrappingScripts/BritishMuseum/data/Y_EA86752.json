{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86752"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows an uneven area, slightly concave, maybe from a leather bag or similar. In the break several turned string impressions. On the top several finger impressions and about a third of an oval scarab-like seal-impression with a very clear cut of a horizontal cartouche of Mn-kheper-R'. To the right of it what looks like a lotus flower. On top of this a larger bent sign, maybe a boat. Rest broken off.
