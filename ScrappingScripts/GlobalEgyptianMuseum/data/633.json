Amelineau at Abydos in 1895-1896. It constitutes the upper part of a shaft depicting the corolla of a papyrus surmounted by a head of Hathor and of two uraei; the one on the right is dressed in the red crown of the Delta, the one on the left wears the white crown of the South. Above the head of Hathor, one can still see the edging which marked the lower part of the spoon. This object, which served as a container for make-up to protect the eyes, probably dates from the Late Period."}
