{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62374", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "BRACELET", "Material": "GOLD", "Technique": "CASTING", "Name": "Flexible Bracelet of king Tutankhamun", "Description": "Howard Carter, who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, called this type of bracelet a \"wristband,\" because it is composed of rows of barrel-shaped beads that make the bracelet flexible around the wrist. The beads are made of gold, electrum, blue glass, lapis lazuli, and calcite.The principal ornament is a large scarab at one end of the bracelet; when worn, the scarab would have appeared to be the central ornament. The scarab is not a single piece of stone, but is made of a number of pieces of lapis lazuli fitted most carefully into gold cloisons fixed to a gold plate. Between the rear legs of the scarab is a basket-shaped sign inlaid with blue glass.The scarab and the basket sign were intended to spell out King Tutankhamun's other name, Neb-kheperw-re, but instead of the expected sun disc between the forelegs, there is a cartouche of the king with the same signs.The bracelet is edged with gold beads and it is finished with a gold fastening, which slides into a corresponding fitting on the side of the scarab to secure the bracelet when it is worn. The bracelet bears signs of having been worn during the king's lifetime."}
