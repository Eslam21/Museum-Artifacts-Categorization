The headrests were generally made of wood and the curved neck-support had a cover made of cloth or straw, to pad the place where the sleeper laid his neck. The custom of using a headrest while sleeping is still current in some African regions. It is believed that the headrest allowed air to circulate round the neck of the sleeper during the hot summer nights, or kept his hairstyle in shape. The Book of the Dead, a collection of religious, ritual or magical spells compiled during the New Kingdom and later periods, provided a special magical spell (number 166) for the headrest amulet. It assured the deceased that his head would never be carried away from him. The spell also helped to ward off the demons that might attack the sleeper at night.The base, the shaft and the neck support of the headrest are carved from the same block; the piece is well polished and has a pleasingly simple form."}
