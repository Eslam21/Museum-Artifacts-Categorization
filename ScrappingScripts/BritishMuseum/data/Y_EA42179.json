The eyebrows and makeup lines around the eyes were once inlaid with lapis lazuli; there are traces of rock crystal in the eye sockets. The hole in the forehead was for the attachment of a gold sun disc between two precious metal horns.

Life-sized cult statues of Hathor as a cow depict her protecting the king himself between her forelegs and giving him milk straight from the udder.
