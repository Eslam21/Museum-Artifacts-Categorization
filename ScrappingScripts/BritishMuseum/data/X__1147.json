", " Parallels in this style of a terracotta woman standing or sitting are found across the Classical world in Rhodes and Attica dated to the mid 5th century BC (see Higgins 1964, nos 210, 211, 212, 213, 220, 222, 669). See parallel from Lindos for hand gesture (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 98, nos 2154, 2156). Naukratis parallels in Bolton Museum (1886.31.32, 1911.44.25) and a local copy in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology CA (NA342). Under the number 1911.44, a mixed batch of objects were originally registered; the sub-numbers were assigned on 11/05/2000. A number of (mainly Cypriot) terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Blinkenberg, C. 1931.
