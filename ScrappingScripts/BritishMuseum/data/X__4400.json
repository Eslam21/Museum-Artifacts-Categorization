This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " More than a hundred votive boxes were discovered in Naukratis. The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). Petrie does not mention any falcon when he lists the various \u201cbronze boxes\u201d found in this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). The discovery of other votive boxes is also attested in the vicinity of the wall surrounding the Great Temenos, but Griffith only mentions bronze reptile cases in his notes from January 1885 (Masson forthcoming b). Votive boxes surmounted by a falcon figure are usually associated with Horus (Weiss 2012, 287), though several deities and the pharaoh himself are linked with this form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54). Petrie signals a figure of Horus amongst the bronze finds of the cache (Petrie 1886, 41); he meant maybe such a votive box. It belongs to the type T 23 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 747-754, Pl. 45d-i, Typ T 23), a type which was mainly found in North Saqqara and Buto. A similar type of relic-box was found at Naukratis (Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,115). The naomorphous (\u2018altar\u2019 or \u2018small shrine\u2019-shaped) box is rare within the Naukratis corpus (on this shape, see Ikram 2005: 335).
