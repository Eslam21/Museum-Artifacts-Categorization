", " Plaster stoppers of this type, were commonly used on wine-amphorae (Thomas 2011, type 5C; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 5). This method of sealing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods and were used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, type 5C). Parallels from late Roman contexts at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.3\u20136) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, fig. 10). For the cross stamp, cf., impressions from Western Thebes (Winlock and Crum, 80, fig. 33.1\u20132). The motif is common on Late Roman amphora stoppers in Egypt, e.g., at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.3\u20137) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, fig. 10). For the stamp itself, cf. a similar, simple circular cross on a wooden stamp without text found at Koptos (Nachtergael 2000, 289, fig. 23). See also EA 53951. Bruy\u00e8re, B. 1966.
