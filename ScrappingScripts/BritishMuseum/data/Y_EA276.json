{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA276"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Nebra: the representations on this round-topped stela are arranged in two registers; they are carved in sunk relief and accompanied by incised texts. In the upper register the god Haroeris is seated on a throne in the centre. Before him stands an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by lotus-flowers. Behind him are carved four eyes and two ears. Four columns of text name the god and the outline-draughtsman Nebre', son of the outline-draughtsman P\u0292y. In tne Iower register Nebra kneels on the right with his arms raised in adoration. A prayer to Haroeris on his behalf is incised on the left. The stela is well preserved apart from some damage to the lower left corner. Traces of black paint remain in many hieroglyphs, on the outer border of the stela, on the wig of Nebra, on the face of Haroeris, on part of the throne and the altar, and on the outer edge of the eyes. Traces of red paint can be seen on the face and body of Nebra, the body and crown of Haroeris, the stem of the lotus, the pupils of the eyes and the edges of the ears in the upper register, and in the lines between the columns of text.
