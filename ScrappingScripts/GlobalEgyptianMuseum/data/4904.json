Texts and representations are in sunk relief. The decorated part is surrounded at the sides and on top by a simple carved line, at the bottom by three carved lines. The lines dividing the texts and registers have also been carved. Only traces of the original paint remain; hieroglyphs and dividing lines were green, skin of the men was reddish brown, of the woman presumably yellow; the hair was black and the collars yellow (?). The front surface was well polished, the top surface is smooth with some chisel marks. The back was probably sawn down in modern times for easier handling. The back and the right and left sides have been completely ground smooth."}
