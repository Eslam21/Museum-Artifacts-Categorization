The lack of decoration on the exterior surface of the sherd may be a result of the sherd's size. The decoration on the exterior surface of Chalice Style vases is not usually extensive and filling ornament, with the exception of a simple rim pattern, a single elaborate rosette and simple handle zone pattern, is absent. Some later Black Figure Komast and Animal chalices do not have any filling ornament either."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1234) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.158"]}
