{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2542", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "10.6 cm", "Width": "4.1 cm", "Depth": "6.7 cm", "Name": "Head of statuette", "Description": "This fragment of statue was acquired by a exchange with the Museum of Cairo in 1907. It is very difficult to discern the identity of the person represented. A single element is important: the head is wearing the red crown of the Delta, which is presented as a sort of mortar of which the back part (here partially disappeared) rises vertically and in which a stalk is fixed, terminating in a spiral. Noticing the feminine facial features, it is very probable that the statuette represents the goddess Neith of Sais."}
