{"artifact_name": "vessel-stamp", "Object Type": ["vessel-stamp"], "Museum number": ["1965,0930.895"], "Description": [" Fragment of a terracotta stamp. There is no handle on the back, although the absolute centre does not survive. The pattern is largely incuse: within a band of egg-and-dart and one of bead-and-reel, moving to right (in the impression). The lower left portion of a horse with rider is depicted, only part of the saddle and right leg of the rider are preserved. Within a ground-line, in relief letters and retrograde in the stamp, is the name \u0398\u0395\u03a9\u039d\u039f\u03a3 (Theonos). Pressed over a plaster form. Orange-brown Nile silt, with a brown surface and abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions.

The name Theonos is relatively common in Egypt from the 3rd century BC onwards. Red Nile silt fabric identical to local kiln production fabric so probably made in Naukratis. Traces of plaster adhere to the stamp suggesting this was used to stamp plaster seals rather than cakes, although this would have been too large from most transport amphorae stopper seals. Amphora stopper stamp. Such objects are commonly described as cake or bread stamps (Petrie 1886; Bailey 2008). However, such an interpretation is called into question by the presence of plaster in the grooves of many examples found at Naukratis, as if used to stamp the seals of amphora stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). This is confirmed by the presence of a stamp from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. xxix; Bolton Museum 1886.31.35) used to stamp a design on a terracotta disc stopper from the same site (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964) and not bread or cake.
