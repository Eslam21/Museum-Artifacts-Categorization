{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 38248", "Dating": "TUTHMOSIS III/MENKHEPERRE", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "OBSIDIAN", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "18 cm", "Name": "Royal Face, Probably Tuthmosis the Third", "Description": "Although only parts of this face carved in obsidian remain, it is clear that the features were very delicate. The style suggests that the sculpture was done during the first half of the Eighteenth Dynasty, most probably for Tuthmosis the Third. The eyes and eyebrows were carved in sunken relief. These would have been inlaid with stone or paste. The quality of the craftsmanship is admirable considering that obsidian is an extremely hard stone of volcanic origin."}
