{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10961"], "Description": [" Papyrus (six fragments). Fragment A is demotic; the other five are hieratic. Fragments A and C are inscribed on both sides; on the verso of fragments E and F there are traces. The versos of fragments B and D are blank. The fibres on the verso of fragment A have been damaged, leaving only two narrow sections of text. Fragment A contains the very ends of three lines of text in column A and the beginning of two lines in column B. It is torn on both sides and the bottom but there appears to be a top margin (although this may be a space between two sections of text). Fragments B-F contain parts of two or three lines of text and are all torn on both sides and top and bottom, apart from fragment F, which preserves a bottom margin.
