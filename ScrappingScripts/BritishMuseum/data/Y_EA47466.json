{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA47458"], "Description": [" Fragmentary green steatite male figure, broken from the torso. He wears a shoulder-length wavy wig, with an undersection of tight curls around the ends of the wig and below both ears. His eyebrows are thick and arched, and his eyes are narrow with a heavy upper eyelid. The mouth and nose are damaged but the outline of the left side is intact. His face is fleshy at the jawline. His upper body is bare, with a cartouche of Amenhotep III on the right breast and another partial cartouche on the right upper arm. On the reverse is the top section of a slim back-pillar, inscribed with finely incised text. The surface of the chest and shoulders are heavily chipped and scratched, and part of the right side of the head and face is now missing. The object is attached to a modern wooden base.
