The fourth sherd in the joined group may be 1924,1201.1157. According to Cook, the decoration seems to have been inspired by the conventional representation of a bird, specifically a partridge: scales for the breast feathers and bars for the folded wings. The breast-feather panel narrowing towards the bottom and the red on these feathers are unusual; the black bands are unusually wide. For a complete oinochoe with this decoration, see Walter-Karydi 1973, pl. 4, no. 47 from Rhodes.
