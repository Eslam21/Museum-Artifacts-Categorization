The letter is now kept with the papyri's self. A collection of 7 sheets from a Codex of the Life of Shenoute (EA 71005,1-71005,7), 36 sheets of Coptic papyri (EA 79673-79708) and 13 other Coptic fragments (EA 76415, EA 76565-76576) was acquired in 1935 from Rutter & Marchant and Co., Sollicitors. They had come many years earlier from the estate of a certain John Lee (died in 1866), along with 13 other Coptic fragments and had been kept in their offices for decades. The company donated the collection to the Museum. ", " Based on similaries with episodes in the Life of Shenoute, Birger Pearson attributed the work to the vita tradition (1989). In their edition, Behlmer and Alcock (1996) identify the narrative as a pseudepigraphic discourse of Shenoute; see Emmel 2004, for the identification of the beginning of a work of Shenoute, You Know, O Brethren.
