It is badly broken, missing ears and central knob which would originally have risen on top of head, and muzzle. A distinctive feature is the 'beard' which runs right round under chin to front of neck. It is made of fine, green glazed composition, now mottled brown, which recalls the close texture of Saite apple green faience. Top of head, horns and snout broken away. Eyes marked by incised lines.
