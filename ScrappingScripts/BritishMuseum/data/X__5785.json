", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This amulet might come from such a context. Other relatively close amulets were discovered in Naukratis, but they are often much more schematic in style. Therefore it is often difficult to identify properly the deity represented. Its attitude, kneeling with his hands raised on both sides of his head, relates to the gods Shu or Heh (on both types of amulets: Andrews 1994, 19 and 88-89; Herrmann et al. 2010, 51-52, type 20). Since their iconography can be very close, Herrmann prefers to not decide between both deities (Herrmann 2006, 88-92, Pl. XX-XXII). Such amulets are very common on Late Period settlements (Masson forthcoming b). In the case of this specimen, it is further difficult to identify the god represented since the upper part of the figure is not preserved.
