This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " A range of crudely carved limestone animals and fantastic creatures were found at Naukratis. Sphinxes and upright human headed birds/cats and griffins were the most common of these. Some may represent a \u2018Libyan\u2019 or \u2018Bastet\u2019 sphinx, representing Libyan influence on Egyptian sculpture of the 1st millennium BC (Gubel 1998, 632-645). Relatively common at Naukratis (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1519, GR 1886,0401.1518 and possibly GR 2011,5011.7; Boston MFA 86.394, Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.72, AN1886.459, AN1886.458; Brussels Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1852; Heidelberg Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t ST55). Petrie dated these, with other limestone figures, between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886, 40, pl.19.1&3), though one was found in a Ptolemaic level (ibid.). Hogarth found one in a \u20185th century BC\u2019 well deposit (Hogarth 1905, 122; Hogarth Diary 24-25/04/1903, well 2 bottom). These are identical style to the \u2018concubine\u2019 and drummer figures of the Saite period, also found in the mid 6th century BC levels of the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, 40, Level 335). Unprovenanced Late Period parallel (Petrie Museum UC59370). Some of the highly varied deviations from this form, such as lying sphinxes, may be later in date (British Museum 1886,0401.1396 and 1886,0401.1485), as they have Late Period or Ptolemaic parallels from Memphis (Anthes 1959; 1965, see also in terracotta Ashton 2003a, 77, Petrie Museum, UC 48012-6; Nicholson & Thomas 2013, 73, P-390) and Saqq\u00e2ra (Quibbel 1907, pl.30.6a-c; see also in terracotta Jeffreys et. al. 1988, fig. 64, nos.77/308 and 77/u 209) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC60105, see also in terracotta T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 126; 98-9, pl.65, no. 129).
