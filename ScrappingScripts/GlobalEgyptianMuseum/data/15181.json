{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "SR 20597", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "27 cm", "Name": "Head of Horus", "Description": "This head of a falcon deity is most likely the god Horus. He wears a three-part wig and the White Crown of Upper Egypt. Although the face is partly damaged, the beak, which is the most striking feature of the falcon, is still visible. Inspired by the living bird, the artist represented the bird's eyes realistically in low-relief. He made the edge of the base curved and left its surface smooth and flat. This suggests that the head was part of a sculptor's study of heads and the figures of deities, rather than being part of a cult statue."}
