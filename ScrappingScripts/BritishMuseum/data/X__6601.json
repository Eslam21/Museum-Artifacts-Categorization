", " For parallels, see Lemos no. 1075 from Tocra. The Ure Museum received sherds from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in 1926, several years after Petrie and Gardner's excavations. It was uncertain then whether the sherds came from Naukratis or Tell Dafana, a site in the eastern Nile Delta that was excavated by Petrie in 1886. Petrie wrote that he found only one sherd of Chian ware at Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888 62), which he described as a plain piece, thus the Chian sherds in the Reading collection come from Naukratis.
