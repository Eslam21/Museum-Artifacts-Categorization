{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1926,0415.42"], "Description": [" Bronze lamp with a bowl-shaped body, a flat top, and a short rounded nozzle with a circular wick-hole. The small filling-hole is surrounded by a raised rim. On the top is a Greek name, apparently a reference to the city of Thysdrus. On the left side is a suspension-lug in the form of a duck's head; on the right is a simple pierced lug. At the rear is a double-ribbed handle, dividing to upper springs with raised knobs. The lamp-lid is hinged at the rear on top of the handle, and is decorated with a snake, the head lost; the stem of the lid is grooved at the lid end. The lamp stands on a wide base-ring, flat within.
