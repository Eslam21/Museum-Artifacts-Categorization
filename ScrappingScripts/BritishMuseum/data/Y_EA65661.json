{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA65661"], "Description": [" Fragment of a lentoid flask: of this vessel there has survived most of the cylindrical neck, a section of the body, and one vertical handle. The body is in opaque black glass, matt surface. The remaining handle is composed of two rods, one opaque black, the other of translucent grey-green. A variation of the usual type is the flaring upper half of the neck. To decorate the flask the maker took a very small gather on his mandril and dropped small quantities of it at irregular intervals. These were then impressed into the body. In this example the spatter decorations are in white and yellow.
