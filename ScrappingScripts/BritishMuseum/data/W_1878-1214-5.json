The shape and worn condition of the seal-stone might suggest that originally this was an unusually large Jemdet-Nasr seal of c. 3000 BC that was recut in the nineteenth century AD with an Egyptianising motif. Thus the stone could well have been sold in Babylon to a tourist, but it is less likely that it would have acquired its design in Mesopotamia. However, as Jemdet-Nasr seals were imported into Egypt in antiquity, the design, and probably the line borders might well have been applied in Egypt in the nineteeth century AD to a worn ancient import, in order to make it more attractive to a prospective buyer. There are, however, no traces of an earlier design."], "Bibliographic references": [" Frankfort H 1939 / Cylinder Seals: a documentary essay on the art and religion of the ancient Near East (pl.XLIV5) ", " Porada E 1948a / Corpus of Near Eastern Studies in North American Collections I.
