This drawing records a painting last recorded at the Hage Gallery in Nivaagard near Copenhagen (canvas, 100 x 130 cm; see Roethlisberger 1986, no. 169). It was made, together with its pendant of LV 103 (see BM inv. no. 1957,1214.111), for a client in Avignon, which is unsurprising given the ponitifical palace there and its contingent presence of Italians. The scene is of a pastoral landscape typical of this period in Claude\u2019s career into which he inserted into the lower right corner a depiction of the rest on the flight to Egypt. This relegation of the biblical episode to a supplementary detail is similarly observable in Claude\u2019s other paintings of this episode, namely LV 60 and 110 (for which see 1957,1214.66 and .116). The present composition is preceded by a preliminary study for the figures that is more successful than their appearance in the completed painting which is now in the Teylers Museum in Harlem (see inv. no. 102; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 612). Like its pendant, the Pastoral Landscape of LV 103, Claude also made a highly finished circular rendition of the composition, albeit with the exclusion of the Holy Family, that is now in The Morgan (inv. no. III, 80; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 614). Lit: M. Roethlisberger, Claude Lorrain, The Paintings, London 1961, LV104, pp. 266\u2013267; M. Roethlisberger, \u2018Claude Lorrain.
