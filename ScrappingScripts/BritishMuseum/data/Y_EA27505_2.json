The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). Three cartouches were discovered in the foundation deposits: one in the north-east corner, one in the south-west one and one in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl.25 no. 11). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this specimen was found at the north-west corner of the pylon. It is usual in Ptolemaic foundation deposits of that type that only a few cartouche-shaped inscribed plaques are discovered and associated to several uninscribed rectangular plaques (Weinstein 1973, 359-360). These cartouches are what allow us to identify the king responsible for the building. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis. Part I, 1884\u20135 (Third memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund), London.
