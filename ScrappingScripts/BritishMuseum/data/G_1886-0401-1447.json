{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1447"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta female figure, following Tanagra types. Top half of a woman standing, looking down slightly to her right, muffled in a himation wrapped round her shoulders and covering her head, leaving exposed only her face and a fringe of hair with a centre parting; the hair apparently rises to a bun at the back of the head. Her left hand is placed on her waist, beneath the shawl, but her right arm emerges from it at her elbow, the hand being raised to hold an unidentified object below her chin, or perhaps gripping a fold of her himation. The back is plain except for a group of short incised lines at the rear of her head; there is a circular vent. Hollow, from two-piece mould, with traces of a white dressing on the front. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica and common white inclusions.
