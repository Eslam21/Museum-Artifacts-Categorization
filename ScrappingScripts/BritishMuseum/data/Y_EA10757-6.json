Papyrus written on the recto in hieratic script. The recto contains a magico-medical text related to pregnancy and birth/mother and child. On the verso there are some later accounts. The text is written in vertical columns. This frame contains lines Di 1-2, Dii 1-4 and Diii 2-5. The papyrus was a full-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
