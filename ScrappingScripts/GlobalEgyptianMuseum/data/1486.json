{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8815", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD (not before); 26TH DYNASTY ?; LATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "CANOPIC JAR", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; UNSPECIFIED STONE-TECHNIQUE; PAINTED; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB; SCULPTURED", "Height": "32.2 cm", "Diameter": "17.5 cm", "Name": "Canopic Jar", "Description": "This canopic jar of limestone was acquired in 1983. The lid takes the form of a falcon head representing Qebehsenef, one of the four Sons of Horus. On the belly is found an inscription of six columns,  written in black paint. They comprise the standard formula of canopic jars of the Late Period, more specifically of the 26th Dynasty, and mention the titles and name of the owner followed by the name of the father and of the mother. All of these prosopographic elements are unfortunately not sufficient for the precise provenance of this piece of high quality."}
