The two boats have similar Z-shaped standards. The men are placed above the cabins, facing right. They are in approximately the same position on both sides, but on one side their legs are much longer. The presence of the two types of handles, the panel decoration on the shoulder and human figures with curving clappers on this vessel and EA35502 has suggested to Aksamit that these jars were painted by the same artist or in the same workshop.
