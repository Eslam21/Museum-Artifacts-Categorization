{"artifact_name": "transport amphora(?)", "Object Type": ["transport amphora (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA23762"], "Description": [" A curved sherd of pale pink pottery with a dull cream slip on the exterior surface. The fabric appears to be of Cypriot origin, and the fragment may have come from a basket-handled amphora. There is an incised emblem on the exterior, cut post-production in an unusual fashion almost as though it had been chiselled. This was probably done with a flint point. The mark has been interpreted as the hieroglyph for the name of the goddess Neith. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Cypriot (?)
