The sherds from this group display stylistic similarities to the two W\u00fcrzburg chalices. Lemos identifies the sherd as belonging to a chalice, but it is quite thick for a chalice and unslipped on its interior. Williams prefers to see parallels with the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl and suggests that the sherd is closely related to the bowl. Furthermore, he believes the piece was painted by the same hand as British Museum 1888,0601.475.d, Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.48.1894 and GR.49.1894, probably also GR.50.1894.
