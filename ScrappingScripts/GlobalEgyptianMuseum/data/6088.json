The skill of the Kerma potter is shown in the elegance of this vessel with its metallic lustre decoration. It has a large black rim, a dark red waist, and an intermediate white band produced by a special method of firing; in this example, the metallic lustre has not been applied to the interior. This type of pot, with its numerous variants, is without doubt a drinking vessel, either placed in tombs or used domestically. A group of these was found in the fortress of Mirgissa, in the levels pertaining to the occupation of the site by Nubian herdsmen during the 2nd Intermediate Period."}
