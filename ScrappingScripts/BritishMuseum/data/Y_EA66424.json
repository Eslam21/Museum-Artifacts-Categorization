At the top there are a curved sky-sign and a winged sun-disk with uraei. On the right stands the prophet of Amun, Horakhbit, son of the prophet of Amun and secretary of the Lord of the Two Lands \u1e24r, clad in a long robe and a leopard-skin, in an act of adoration. Before him is an altar heaped with offerings. On the left sits the god Ra-Horakhty, mummiform. Between them are eight columns of text consisting of a funerary invocation of Ra-Horakhty, Atum, and Ptah-Sokar-Osiris on behalf of the deceased. On the sides are the standards of East and West. The stela is cracked in several places and slightly discoloured at the top left and the bottom right. The paint has faded in some areas. The general background is white with a blue sky-sign at the top. The disk is red with a white border and uraei outlined in black. The upper wings are white with a blue upper edge, while the lower are green edged in red with feathers delineated in black. The deceased has a red body, black beard, eyebrow, and eye on white. His cone is red and white, his wig blue, and the lotus-bud on his head green and brown. His collar is green, the leopard-skin is brown with black features, and his kilt is white with black lines. The legs and left shoulder under the gown are pink. The altar is blue with white and pink offerings. The lotuses are green with pink flowers, brown bases, and pink stems.
