{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA459"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone figure of an official, only the right-side portion of the body and base now intact. The figure\u2019s right leg is cloaked and laid flat, suggesting that he adopted a cross-legged position. Much of the body is now lost. Two lines of continuous text are inscribed around the statue base, both beginning at the front of the base. These are two offering formulae based on their opening lines, and on the right side this continues with a dedication to Hathor, Mistress of Thebes. The left side of the figure and base has been broken off, and both right corners of the statue base are also damaged. The object is now supported on a thick modern base.
