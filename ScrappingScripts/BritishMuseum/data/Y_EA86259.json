{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86259"], "Description": [" Almost complete scarab, chipped slightly at the base, clypeus is missing made of steatite. Whitish-beige colour with incised lines, glazed in white. The division between elytra and prothorax is indicated by an incised line, as is the suture. The outer lines of the elytra as well as the prothorax are shown with two lines. At the back another line parallel to the perforation. The humeral callosities are shown by triangles. Head and eyes preserved, clypeus broken off. The side shows the legs in fine relief with hairs indicated by small diagonal, parallel lines. Underneath the base part. The back of the scarab is not perfectly symmetrical, one side (the right of the beetle) is higher than the other and therefore it looks a bit irregular. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base very close to the edge. Two columns of hieroglyphs facing right: 1) first sign not preserved, underneath maybe nb - wDA - 'Imn - R'/t-t and maybe a book roll at the edge but this sign joined with the oval line, 2) first sign unclear, maybe TAw-sail - seated mAa.t with anx on her lap - underneath not clear, maybe an animal? - first part of an n waterline. High quality. Perforation along the longitudinal side.
