The protrusion on the back has been hollowed out and has a row of perforations on the upper edge. It is not clear whether such objects were intended to be containers of some sort. The horn-shaped protrusion is usually rather small and not completely hollowed out. They are more likely to be magical objects or decorative elements."}
