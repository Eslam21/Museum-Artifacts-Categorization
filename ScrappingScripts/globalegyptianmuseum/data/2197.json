{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1904:515", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "2.4 cm", "Depth": "1.1 cm", "Name": "Amulet of menat", "Description": "Wooden panel shaped to the keyhole form of the menat or counterpoise. Originally a practical counterweight to the heavy broad collar, the menat became an object of cult in its own right, offered to the goddess Hathor as the patron of all that is sensuous, including jewellery. Votive menat amulets are often of brilliant blue faience, and this item too may have been painted, but no traces survive. There are two holes at the proper lower end of the menat, either for attaching strings of beads or perhaps only for suspension in the sanctuary where the piece was offered. It was found at the shrine of the goddess in the Deir el-Bahari bay on the West Bank at Thebes."}
