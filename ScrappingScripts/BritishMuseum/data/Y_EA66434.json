Petrie illustrated a number of different versions on scarabs and scaraboids (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 4-7). This type was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 98-99, type XXVIII, subtype A159-166). Note that the motif does not look to be stamped, and the cast technique is a major characteristic of Gorton's type XXVIII.
