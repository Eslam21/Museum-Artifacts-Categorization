{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2676", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "ANIMAL/HYBRID FIGURINE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED; FAYENCE", "Height": "8 cm", "Depth": "7 cm", "Name": "Hippopotamus in turquoise faience", "Description": "The figurines of female hippopotami were often part of funerary material of the Middle Kingdom. The blue colour of the skin, which is not natural, refers to the aquatic environment in which the animal lived and symbolises fertility and fecundity. They are also decorated with aquatic plants, such as the lotus, symbol of rebirth. This lovely example from Brussels has been found in a tomb of Abydos during the excavations of J. Garstang in 1908. It is certain that this figurine also had a protective role."}
