{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:790", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "1 cm", "Name": "Amulet", "Description": "Faience figure of the symbol named in Egyptian texts as tiyet, and associated with the goddess Isis. Even in less stylised examples its original form and function are unclear, but it seems to have been a symbolic knot related to childbirth. It was found at the temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari, focus of the cult of the goddess Hathor on the West Bank at Thebes. Numerous votive offerings to the goddess were left by men and women, probably seeking the safe birth of a child. The offerings include a high proportion of blue faience items, presumably a material and colour associated by the Egyptians with fertility."}
