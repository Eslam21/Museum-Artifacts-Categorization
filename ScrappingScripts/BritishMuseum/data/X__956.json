", " The name of Menkheperra appears on a wide range of scarabs. It does not necessarily refer to the prenomen of Thutmosis III and it is used here to write the name of the god Amun-Ra. In addition to this specimen from Naukratis, Jaeger quoted several examples from various Mediterranean sites where such scarabs were discovered (Jaeger 1982, 56, \u00a7 196). A similar scarab was found in Motya in Sicily (Gorton 1996, type VI, 19-20, no. 14). Another close parallel, but made of glazed composition and with a winged sun on the top register, was discovered in Italy, in a context dated around 700 BC (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 9, pl. 67/2, no. 28).
