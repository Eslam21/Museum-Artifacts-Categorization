Most were arrow heads with a transversal cutting edge. In other words, the bevelled rectilinear side of the head was perpendicular to the shaft and assured contact and impact. The circular side, the back of the head, was directly fitted to the hard wooden shaft, which was set in the stalk of a reed.  Occasionally, other heads were placed right under the main arrow head, on either side of the shaft (cant parallel to the shaft, this time), thus creating a barbed arrow.  These were fixed to the wood with a dark bronze-green adhesive."}
