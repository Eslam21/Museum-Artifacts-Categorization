Another stela with the same text was erected at Amada. The elongated rectangular stela with a rounded top is broken into numerous parts which have been divided between the Egyptian collections of Vienna and Cairo. The top of the stela is framed by a winged disk. Beneath it are two scenes showing the king facing the gods, divided by a central column of inscription. Hieroglyphic legends are inscribed over the two scenes. To the right the king is being led by the goddess of the cataract, Anuqet, to the state god Amun, while to the left he venerates Khnum, the Lord of Elephantine. Two-thirds of the stela's surface is covered by a long inscription in horizontal lines. This text extols the king's warlike virtues, continuing with a list of his pious donations and architectural restorations to the temples. The images have been carved in low relief, whereas the signs of the inscriptions are deepened. On the right lateral side is another scene in relief."}
