", " The size of the foot suggests that it comes from a large vessel such as a heavy chalice The heavy decoration is however, typical of the Wild Goat Style. The sherd should belong to the end of the period of the Wild Goat Style since the heavy chalice does not normally appear as early as that style, while the thickness and diameter of this sherd suggest that it comes from a vessel much larger than a chalice. Perhaps the sherd marks the transition to the Mature Animal Style.
