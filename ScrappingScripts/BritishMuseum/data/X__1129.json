{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" East Greek protome of female head. The eyes are asymmetrically sided and of unnatural length. The mouth is naturalistically depicted and asymmetrical with a bold curve between the lower lip and chin. The hair, except that part which is immediately over the forehead, is entirely concealed by an elaborate coiffure; a veil of crinkled material drawn under a huge tiara or stephane, and fastened above the centre of the forehead by being knotted into a large bow. A crimped edge finishes it off prettily in front, and from beneath this a certain amount of hair is allowed to escape. White coating with traces of brown or black paint on hair. Fine red-brown fabric with grey core and rare mica or quartz and white inclusions. Pieced together from twelve fragments, missing large portions of whole.
