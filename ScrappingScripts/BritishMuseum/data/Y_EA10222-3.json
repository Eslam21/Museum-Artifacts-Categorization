Teachings are didactic works, mostly ascribed to famous sages, and they discuss general matters of life and moral principles in the form of short sayings and warnings. The main story tells of a father who seeks to encourage his son to become a scribe during their journey from their home to the royal residence. He extols the virtue of the scribal profession whilst disparaging other trades, including brickmaking, carpentry, weaving, weapon making, farming and others. Although the entire composition may not have been intended as satire, many of the descriptions of the other professions clearly have satirical and exaggerated elements. The last third of the text becomes more like traditional instructional literature, with general advice. The text was clearly a popular learning resource, perhaps in scribal schools, and dozens of copies survive on papyri, writing boards, and ostraca. Mistakes slipped in in the process, which were then subsequently copied. The most complete known version is found on the Papyrus Sallier II (EA10182,3-11). General bibliography: W.K. Simpson, 2003.
