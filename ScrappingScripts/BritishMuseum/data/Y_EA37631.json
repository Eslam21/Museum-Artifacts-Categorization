{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA37631"], "Description": [" A pottery flask in the form of two ribbed pots with short-necked narrow mouths, slightly flaring. Their lower areas (their bases are roughly flat) are encrusted with large acanthus and plain leaves. The pots are probably miniature amphorae (although not of a well-known type), but only the outer handle in each case is modelled: from these handles floral swags droop over the amphorae, and are tied with a wide ribbon which hangs down on each side. A small naked Harpokrates sits between the jars, his finger to his mouth, holding a cornucopia to his left shoulder, and wearing a Double Crown. The rear is unmodelled, except for a small pierced suspension-lug immediately behind Harpokrates. Two-piece mould. Orange-brown Nile silt, with a little mica; overall slip of much the same colour: perhaps related to Memphis Black Ware.
