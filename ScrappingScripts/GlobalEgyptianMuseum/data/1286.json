In the two scenes one sees the deceased on his knees and with arms raised before a chapel. The one on the right shelters the anthropomorphic god Ptah, patron of the town of Memphis; in the one on the left we find the god Sokar, protector of the Memphite necropolis, who is represented with the head of a falcon dressed with an Osirian crown. The text of the stela contains a classic offering formula and finishes with an \"appeal to the living\"."}
