The mane is ornamental and gives a noble rather than a frightful appearance to the leonine face with its bony skull and stylized whiskers. On top of the head rises, or rather rose, a solar disk with a royal cobra which emphasizes the cosmic aspects of this composite manifestation of hazardous divinity. The face has been modelled with extreme care. Its eyes are small and framed by eyelids in relief, which were originally painted, as were the five-partite collar and the edge of the robe. The goddess is seated on a block throne with a low back. To the left and right of the legs of the goddess, vertical lines of inscription have been added to the surface of the throne."}
