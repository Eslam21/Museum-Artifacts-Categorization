{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA21"], "Description": [" Grandiorite statue of Horemheb with Amun-Ra: the figures are carved, almost in the round, in one piece with a back support and low pedestal. The god is represented shrouded and bears the attributes of the ithyphallic god Min. When complete he wore the plumed head-dress, a beard and a bead collar, and held in the right hand a flail. The left arm is placed under the shrouds and grasps the base of the phallus (missing). Beneath the right arm stands the king, wearing a beard, bead collar and short skirt with a girdle on which his prenomen is incised. In the right hand he carries a roll; the left hand rests against the right side of the god. An inscription is incised on the front of the back support between the two figures, and another on the upper surface of the pedestal. Between the two figures, is one vertical column of text. On the pedestal are two vertical columns of text. The monument has been reassembled from the four fragments into which it was broken. The following portions are missing: the plumes which were morticed on to the god's head-dress, part of the beard, nearly the whole of the right arm, and the phallus; the king's head, right arm as far as the wrist, and left foot; the upper portion of the back support behind the figure of the king and a large piece from the left-hand side of the pedestal.
