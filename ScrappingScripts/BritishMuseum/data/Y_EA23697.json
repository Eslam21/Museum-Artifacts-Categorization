{"artifact_name": "cup", "Object Type": ["cup"], "Museum number": ["EA23697"], "Description": [" A cup of pale cream-grey marlware pottery, with a flattened base and almost straight sides, which rise vertically to a plain rim. There is a slight groove around the exterior at the base of the sides. This appears to be the result of manufacturing the base as a separate piece which was then attached, the groove marking the join. Viewed from above, the diameter can be seen to be slightly irregular.
