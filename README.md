## Description

Archaeology involves studying the human past through artifacts like stone, bone, pottery, etc.
Practitioners classify artifacts based on date, cultural attribution, and socioeconomic significance. Computer applications, particularly machine
learning models, have been introduced to enhance this process for automated archaeological classifications (Derech et
al., 2021; Tal, 2014). Our project presents a comprehensive approach to the classification of
museum artifacts, focusing on Egyptian monuments. The methodology involves collecting and
combining visual and tabular data on Egyptian artifacts. Progress on this
challenge improves the tools of a museum curator while improving content-based exploration
by online visitors of the museum collection.
