{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.45"], "Description": [" Terracotta male figure carrying wreath and jar. Mould-made. The upper part of a standing man, a celebrant, wearing a short belted skirt and a bulla on a chain round his neck. His hair recedes over his forehead and he has a tightly woven wreath. A large, separately made phallus was inserted in a hole in the appropriate place, but only a stump remains, fixed in place by plaster. He holds against his left shoulder an Egyptian amphora, with a smooth body, a ribbed neck and a rounded seal. In his lowered right hand he has a looped garland. The back is summarily treated, only the skirt being well indicated. At the nape of the neck is a suspension-loop, probably showing that the figure had no plinth. Both the figure and the inserted phallus were made in two-piece moulds; they are hollow. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a dark-brown core. There are a few traces of an overall white dressing, with pink paint on the wreath, the chain of the bulla, the neck of the amphora and behind the lower right arm.
