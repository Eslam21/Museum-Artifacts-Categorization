The fire lighter functions through the fast rotating, by hand or by using a bow with thongs, of the fire stick into drill holes. The fire stick has 12 holes that contain resin to create the spark by friction which then ignites the nearby tinder. The drill stick is topped by a separate head which helped the user to hold it steady."}
