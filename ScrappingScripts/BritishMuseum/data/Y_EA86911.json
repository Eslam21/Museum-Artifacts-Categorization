{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86911"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a concave surface with wood impression, probably from a bolt. One impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.35cm is impressed perpendicular to the wood. The upper side is roughly flat with the lateral side bending downwards and showing many finger imprints. The upper two thirds of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible on the top, 0.4 cm further to the right another impression of the same motif is visible. Recognisable are two stylized standing figures holding a staff between them. The figure on the left is probably Re-Harakhte and the one on the right Amun. Both are positioned on top of a standing line. The same motif can be found on EA86902 and EA86915. The style is very similar to the motif of EA86792, EA86793, EA86799, EA86800, EA86801, EA86802 and EA86812.
