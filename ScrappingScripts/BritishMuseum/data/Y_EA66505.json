Gorton identified the motif depicted on the underside as a standing figure holding two snakes, a rather common orientalising theme (Gorton 1996, 121). However, the figure does not seem to hold the cobras in his hands like one would expect from a Master of the Animals. For a rather similar motif on a scaraboid from Naukratis: BM 1886,0401.1690.
