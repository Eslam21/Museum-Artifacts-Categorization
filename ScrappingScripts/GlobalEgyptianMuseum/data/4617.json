{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "129", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE; SANDSTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; PAINTED", "Height": "33.2 cm", "Width": "22.8 cm", "Depth": "5 cm", "Name": "Stela for Senwosret", "Description": "A rectangular stela with a rounded top. The scenes and texts are painted. The text was written in rows marked by black lines in characters, which are an intermediate stage between cursive hieroglyphs and hieratic. The colours are well preserved, although the text (in black) has become faint and has been erased in some places. The lunette holds no representation of any sort. The registers are separated by thick black lines with the lines becoming much thinner towards the edges. The background is yellow and all outlines are in black. Both figures and text sometimes show errors and other signs of haste. The outlines sometimes show a double line (preliminary sketch). The front was polished but is not flat - the upper register shows a very slight hollowing, which is not due to damage. The edges, however, are damaged."}
