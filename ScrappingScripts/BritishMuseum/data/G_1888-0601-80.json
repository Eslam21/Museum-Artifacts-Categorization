The pigment had to be ground and mixed with water. Probably found in the cemetery (from Gardner's season, when other fragments of red ocre were found in a funary context; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1888.193). A small stone mortar was found in 1903 with traces of red ochre (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4553), it is not certain whether this was excavated or acquired in 1903 by Hogarth."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (ZA.18)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.80"]}
