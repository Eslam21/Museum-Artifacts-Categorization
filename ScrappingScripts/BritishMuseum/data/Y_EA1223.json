{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1223"], "Description": [" False door of Wadjkaiankhi: the upper part of this monument consists of a raised panel with two smaller side-panels set back, all three being carved in very fine, low relief. On the central panel there is a representation of the deceased seated before an offering-table, above and below which are lists of conventional offerings. On the left side-panel is a representational palace-fa\u00e7ade above which the deceased is described as 'son of Khenet'. On the right side-panel are five small registers with finely carved piles of food-offerings. The lower part of the monument preserves the top half of the false door; there are single lines of text on the lintel and drum with a short offering-formula and the name of the deceased. Each jamb bears two lines of text giving his titles. There has been much surface disintegration through the action of salt. The semicircular cut on the left jamb is probably ancient and structural. No colour remains. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 4th Dynasty (?) ", " 5th Dynasty (?)
