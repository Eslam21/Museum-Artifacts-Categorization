However, this likely came from an earlier simple horse figurines are common in the Archaic and Cypro-Archaic periods of Greece and Cyprus. Simple hand-made rider figurines were made in the Nile Delta of Egypt during the Late Period and found in Naukratis (British Museum GR1886,0401.1468; Higgins 1954, 407; GR1973,0501.18; Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA599; Bristol Museum, H2223; Bolton Museum, 1966.93), Toukh el Karenis (Cairo Museum TR14/1/34/5= SR5/1744), unprovenanced (Cairo Museum TR14/1/ 34/6=SR5/1849; CG32901=SR5/ 1835). They were possibly copying 'Persian rider' types (see British Museum GR1888,0601.90) or Cypriot or Greek types. This may have had a rider. The fine fabric resembles that of some Egyptian Nile silt pieces and some East Greek pieces from Naukratis.
