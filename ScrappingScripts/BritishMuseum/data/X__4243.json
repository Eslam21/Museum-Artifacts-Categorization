", " Marked in red ink \"15\". Phoenician amphora with mud stopper depicted in the background. Two examples from Naukratis probably come from the same mould series (Boston MFA 86.395; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1849). Higgins suggests a similar piece from Naukratis was made there (Higgins 1954, 404), though this type is too generic of the Nile Delta to be specifically attribute to Naukratis. The fabric is in keeping with western Nile Delta kiln products. The form is similar to Rhodian types of mid to late 7th century BC, which combined with the assumption of a 615 BC settlement of Naukratis seems to have guided Higgin's rather specific 615BC- 600BC date for this type. Similar examples from Memphis and elsewhere in Egypt are given Late period or early Ptolemaic dates (Higgins 1954, 404; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148-9, pl. 40.1-5 no. 263-7; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, 137-9, pl.108-109, no. 202-209). The Phoenician amphora depicted, style and technique used to create this plaque would appear to confirm a Late Period date for this piece. Bayer-Niemeier, E. 1988. Liebieghaus Museum Alter Plastik.
