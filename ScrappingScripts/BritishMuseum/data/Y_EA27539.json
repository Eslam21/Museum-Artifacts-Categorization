His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). Amulets in the shape of Bes heads appear in the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 40). They were produced in Naukratis itself. Moulds for Bes head, though of different type, were discovered at the site (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 14): see for example BM 1888,0601.747 and BM 1920,0417.2. The amulet BM 1885,1101.55 could have been produced with the same mould as London, Petrie Museum UC52848. However since BM 1885,1101.55 is incomplete and the features are quite eroded, this is only an hypothesis.
