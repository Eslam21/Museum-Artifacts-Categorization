{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "50", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY (not before); 19TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "OFFERING BASIN", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "21.5 cm", "Width": "27 cm", "Depth": "17.5 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a Hathor basin", "Description": "This is a fragment of a circular washbasin from a temple. The couple who dedicated it, and whose names are only partly preserved (perhaps the owners of Theban Tomb 222), are kneeling on the ground, with their hands on the edge of the basin, and looking inside the basin in the hope of sharing in the water libation. On the interior face of the basin in front of them is the face of Hathor with cow's ears in raised relief, as is usual with this type of basin, where she appears as decoration regardless of which god the basin was dedicated to. Images like this, however, are usually found on the exterior face. The basin and the figures have been carved from a single piece of stone."}
