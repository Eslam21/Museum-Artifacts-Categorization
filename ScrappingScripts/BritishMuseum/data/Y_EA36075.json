XVIII, no. 75). None has the hatching inside figures. The scarab belongs to Gorton type XII, a type especially well-distributed on Punic sites, but present also in Greece, Cyprus and in Naukratis in Egypt (Gorton 1996, 34-38, type XII). According to the examples discovered in good contexts, this type is attested from around 800 BC till 700 BC (Gorton 1996, 37). It could be one of these early scarabs discovered at Naukratis. For another example of this type from Naukratis, see Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86,675. On the presence of scarabs predating the occupation of Naukratis: Masson forthcoming. Other scarabs from Naukratis present a similar composition (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 62; motif found on four examples, two in Egyptian blue and two in glazed composition). Gardner, E.
