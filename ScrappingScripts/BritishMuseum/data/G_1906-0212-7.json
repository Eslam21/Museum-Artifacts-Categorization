Re-thinking Marathon: two memorabilia from the battle of Marathon at the Pitt-Rivers. www.prm.ox.ac.uk ", " Baitinger suggests this arrow-head type was developed from Mycenaean forms that continued to be used into the Hellenistic period (Baitinger 2001, Dornpfeilspitzen types 1A4 figs 34-35). The Archaic form developed out of Late Bronze Age Greek and Cretan types and the use of them is associated with the composite bow. This form was also found on the battlefield of Marathon (Snodgrass 1964, 145-7, boss and barb tanged \u2018Cretan\u2019 type Form 1C2; 1967, 81, fig. 35; Erdmann 1973, 35 Form B1, 1200, 7th to 1st century BC).
