{"artifact_name": "architecture", "Object Type": ["architecture"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1535"], "Description": [" Fragment of terracotta rosette from a round bowl-like object, perhaps intended for the decoration of wall-surfaces; sunk within a high straight lip. This fragment is similar to B 400 and B 402. The flat and round centre ground has a depth of 1.5 to 4.5 cm. Moreover it is framed by a rim of convex leaflets on a s-shaped profile. The rim frames an inner octagonal and 1.5 cm high wall and a concluding bulge. The bottom surface is almost even and the interior of the fragment is badly fabricated, whilst the exterior is rubbed, irregular and has a rounded area without traces of tooling, finger imprints etc. The fragment was made of a burnt light grey and slightly sandy clay.

The interior profile is similar to fragment B 400, however, this piece has s a different wall thickness.It was possibly part of a sculptured rosette, though the shape of the leaves and the flat, deep centre would argue against this. Nevertheless, Petrie and Pryce describe the fragments as decorative rosettes that were set into the plaster of a mud brick wall; Petrie throught the piece might come from the doorway of the temple (Petrie 1886, 15). According to Koenigs this seems very unlikely due to the small size of the piece, the lack of paint and engobe, but also the lack of comparable exampes of recessed rosettes. He therefore suggests an interpretation as a smaller modelled terracotta object such as a lamp or a cake stamp, although the latter normally have a positive profile.
