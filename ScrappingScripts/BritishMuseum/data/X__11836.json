XXXVIII, no. 188). It should be in the British Museum (Newberry 1906, 188; Petrie 1889, pl. 64, no. 2035). Ptahnefer used to be a rare anthroponym used in the Memphite region in the 19th dynasty; it became more common with the 26th dynasty (occuring notably on several steles of the Serapeum: Thirion 1995, 173). His title of \u201cgovernor of governors\u201d would indicate that he was a regional prefect directing several governors of the provinces of the \u2018Kingdom of the West\u2019 depending on Sais. According to Yoyotte, this scarab must be dated to the Saite Period (Yoyotte 1994-95, 670). This Ptahnefer could be the same person as the one mentioned on the Serapeum steles nos 194, 195 (Thirion 1995, 173). On this scarab, see especially: Petrie 1886, pl.
