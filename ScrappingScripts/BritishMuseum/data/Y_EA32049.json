{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA32049"], "Description": [" A pottery flask with a flattened circular body decorated in relief: on each side is a narrow notched border. At the centre is a small rosette from which the long petals of a large rosette extend to the border. Encircling the base of the neck is a series of tongues, encroaching on the body; the central long tongue has an angular tip. The neck survives but much of the flaring mouth is broken away. On each side of the neck are two handles with large bolster lower springs. Two non-functional bolster feet are placed at the bottom. On one edge a series of hieroglyphs have been cut after firing. Two-piece mould: the two sides do not come from the same mould-series. Dark-grey Nile silt with some mica, covered with a black slip (Memphis Black Ware).

Chester. Ptolemaic, late third to second century BC. Most of the signs of the hieroglyphic inscription occur in antiquity, but some face in the wrong direction within the whole inscription; it cannot be read as a continuous text, and was probably engraved by a dealer to increase the value of the flask (I am grateful to Morris Bierbrier and Carol Andrews for discussing this inscription).
