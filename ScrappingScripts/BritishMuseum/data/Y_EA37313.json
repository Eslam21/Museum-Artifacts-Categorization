{"artifact_name": "necklace(?); bead", "Object Type": [" necklace (?) ", " bead "], "Museum number": ["EA37313"], "Description": [" Necklace (?): composed of very small standard convex and truncated convex bicone beads, spherical beads and some barrels. Most of the beads are of garnet, six are of cornelian and one of lapis lazuli. The beads are graded in size with the larger ones at the centre of the string, although it is not known if this was the original arrangement. A few of the beads have a silver deposit on them, probably the remains of a clasp or some other silver object which has corroded away completely. It is most unlikely that the silver was an intentional coating. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Middle Kingdom (?) ", " New Kingdom (?)
