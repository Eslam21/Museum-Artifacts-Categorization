{"artifact_name": "figure; lamp", "Object Type": [" figure ", " lamp "], "Museum number": ["EA2312"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Osiris-Canopus, incorporating a small lamp in the plinth. The head wears a 'nemes' headdress, with uraeus on the brow, surmounted by the horns, leaves and disc of the atef crown. A rectangular bulla hangs on the chest by a cord round the shoulders; below the cord are two large circular impressions. The back has no detail, and a circular depression is situated in its centre. Brown, micaceous clay; details of face, headdress and the bulla cord picked out in black; traces of white on headdress, crown and bulla; these pigmentation details are probably of post-firing application.
