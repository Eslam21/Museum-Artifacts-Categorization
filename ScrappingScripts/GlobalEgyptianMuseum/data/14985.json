Each piece of this statuette was carved separately and then assembled. The statuette once held a scepter as we can see from the hole in the left hand. Traces of the black color surrounding the eyes are still visible. This statuette is fixed on a base, which is carved with the Hetep-di-Nisew offering formula that would enable the text to magically become real offerings to help the deceased survive in the underworld."}
