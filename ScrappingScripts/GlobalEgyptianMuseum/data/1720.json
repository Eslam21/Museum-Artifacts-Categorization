This was among the animals depicted as pets in images of the wealthy at home, in tomb-chapels of the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms. Egyptian texts do not explain the precise significance of the creature as an amulet, but presumably it was intended to secure for the owner certain qualities seen in the monkey, such as procreative activity."}
