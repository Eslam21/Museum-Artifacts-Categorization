{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M14050", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED", "Name": "Mummy", "Description": "This adult male mummy lies in a fine 18th Dynasty coffin which belonged to a singer in the temple of Amun, Ankhesenhesi, but the body dates to the Late Period. The general condition of the mummy is good, the outer shroud held in place by broad retaining bandages. It is possible that artificial eyes have been inserted. The body cavity shows some evidence of either a packing material or a visceral package, but it is equally possible to interpret this opacity as representative of non-evisceration when compared to two similar bodies in Cambridge. The arms lie extended across the genital region."}
