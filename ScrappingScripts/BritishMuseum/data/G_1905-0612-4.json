{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1905,0612.4"], "Description": [" Marble figure of a powerful muscular male cat, with front paws with claws extended resting on a twisted bird. Powerful with pronounced rib cage and muscles on shoulder and legs with thick tail. One forepaw on duck or goose. Red colouring on neck of bird and the cats left paw may have indicated blood. The head, tail, bottom of the back legs and rear part of base has broken off. Top and right side of paw is damaged. Unfinished rear of sculpture group. The cat\u2019s front right paw is not completely carved. Instead, the junction between the cat\u2019s body and this leg is marked with a shallow groove. Similarly, the bird\u2019s wing is only roughly carved, and its underside is only blocked out coarsely with a punch. The body of the bird is treated in a similar cursory manner, with not even an attempt made by the sculptor to mark out its lower extremities: here the marble is left rough. There are areas of the front of the group that have not been finished in the round, for instance at the junction between the bird\u2019s and cat\u2019s body: the sculptor has left an area of coarsely chiselled marble. Furthermore, there is a rough stump beneath the cat\u2019s body at the front, and here the cat\u2019s underside has not been properly modelled. The genitals of the cat are also only roughly modelled. Greek workmanship is evident in the tool mark remains. Running drill used to separate body from base and rump from tail. Most of the surface is covered with claw chisel marks. The bird eye is indicated by an unfinished drill hole. Parts of the bird have also been treated in a rather cursory manner, particularly in areas which would have been less visible. The bird\u2019s left eye is indicated by a shallow drill hole, unlike the more detailed carving of the right eye. That the whole group was originally brightly painted is suggested by the remains of red pigment, probably indicating blood, around the bird\u2019s neck and under the cat\u2019s protracted right claw where it grasps the bird\u2019s wing. The surface was not completely finished as there are claw chisel marks over much of the body. Traces of Egyptian blue paint on the beak of the bird, red on the paws and yellow paint on the rear right leg of the cat. The marble is a fine grained white marble with mica possibly Pentelic marble from the Penteliko Mountain near Athens. Missing: lower back legs and paws; all of the back half of the plinth; the neck and head and the tail; the top and right side of the right fore-paw are also slightly damaged. There are minor abrasions to the surface.

These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria. 1905,0612.4 and 1905,0612.5 were probably made by the same sculptor as both have the same carving style, subject and pose: that of a powerful, muscular, alert cat in an active pose with similar rendering of detail, sharply cut groin and stretched back leg (unlike other cats that are more rounded and less powerful, relaxing). 1905,0612.5 is slightly larger and more muscled than 1905,0612.4, but animals were often offered as pairs and may have been intended as such. The sculpture was probably intended to be seen from the front only, or at least in a position where it would be difficult to examine the back of the group carefully. This is evident from the unfinished state of the rear of the group. Previously restored with the head GR1905.6-12.10. The bird appears to be a representation of a goose. All the birds represented in the British Museum Naukratis cat sculpture group were covered with traces of Egyptian blue plaint. Geese in the Late Period were commonly sacrificed for Horus, son of Isis, representing the symbolic destruction of the enemy (Junker 1910, 69-79; Wildung 1977; Graindorge 1996, 89-91; Bouanich 2005, 151), as represented in contemporary third century BC depictions of Harpokrates (Horus) strangling a fox-goose (British Museum GR 1845,0705.1; Ridgway 2006: 645 fig. 1; Schollmeyer 2003; 2007). Geese were also sacrificed during the festival of Isis in Alexandria and Philadelphia (Dunand 1973, 76; P. Cair. Zen. IV.59560; BGU VII.1501) and for the empress Arsinoe Philadelphos (P. Oxy. 27 2465; Schorn 2001, who was likened to Aphrodite and Isis). Bouanich, C. 2005. Mise \u00e0 mort rituelle de l\u2019animal, offrande carn\u00e9e dans le temple \u00e9gyptien, in S.
