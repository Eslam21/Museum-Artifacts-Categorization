The body is hemispherical with a restricted mouth and a lip, cut with a knife, in continuation of the body wall. The upper section of the body is decorated with diagonal hatching, crossed by two diagonal lines in opposite directions. The incisions were made with a wide instrument and are not deep. The bottom was not reinforced with agate, as was common practice, and is therefore damaged through use. The vessel is decorated with punctated dotted bands made with a swivelling serrated roller."}
