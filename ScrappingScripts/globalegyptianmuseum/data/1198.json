They were supposed to revitalise the deceased. This mummiform statuette of wood is wearing a tripartite wig in dark blue which partly covers the large collar. The face and the neck show traces of green, the ultimate osirian colour. The body is covered by a red sheath decorated with a black netting motif. The lid of the socle is missing. The text written on the front face and the back of the statuette comprises a classical offering formula."}
