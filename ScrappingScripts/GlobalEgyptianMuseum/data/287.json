{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2196", "Dating": "NEOLITHIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AXE", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN", "Height": "11 cm", "Width": "6.6 cm", "Depth": "2.4 cm", "Name": "Polished flint axe", "Description": "Ancient Egyptian polished stone axes were usually made of hard stones such as basalt and diorite. This flint example, with a lenticular profile, is therefore an uncommon type. The polishing, which is usually confined to the cutting edge, here covers the entire body of the axe. The striations from the polishing are still clearly visible. We can assume that this axe was originally inserted into a wooden shaft. A similar artefact, found in a grave at Naqada, has been ascribed to the Naqada II Period. However, it cannot be ruled out that this example is perhaps much older and belongs to a Neolithic culture phase, perhaps the Faiyum Neolithic."}
