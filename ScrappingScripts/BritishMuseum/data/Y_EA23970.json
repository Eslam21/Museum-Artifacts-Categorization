The actual function of the item is undetermined (part of a weapon, spur, ornament?), Petrie's identification as part of a helmet-peak's ornament remains questionable. It might be the tip of a broken 'cage fire head' or 'basket fire' type arrow-head.

Petrie, Tanis ii, Nebesheh and Defenneh, p. 110; see also ibid., p. 77-78 \u00a7 77: \"The objects 8 to 11 are difficult to explain; possibly they may be ornaments fort the peaks of helmets : the thin strips bent out splay at the base of 9, 10, 11, seem as if to fasten the spike into some leather object, and yet it would not be suited for a spur, owing to the barbed form: these barbs could hardly be for use, as the attachment of spike by the splay branches would scarcely be strong enough to bear the wrench of dragging the barbed spike out from anything. On the whole then they were more probably ornamental\"."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1888 / Tanis. Part II.
