{"Present location": "PELIZAEUS-MUSEUM [04/030] HILDESHEIM", "Inventory number": "0748", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE; PLASTER; GOLD; UNSPECIFIED", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; STUCCO; PAINTED; GOLD FOILED", "Height": "46.8 cm", "Width": "23.5 cm", "Depth": "16 cm", "Name": "The goddess Bastet", "Description": "This figure of Bastet was originally entirely gilded. Its modelling is much indebted to Graeco-Roman art, as is apparent not only from its formal appearance but also from the garment with its many folds which has the Isis knot on the chest. A small figure of the god Bes has now largely disappeared, but his deformed legs are still visible to the right of the goddess on the base. Bastet is represented standing upright in mainly human form but with the head of a cat. She is holding a sistrum in her right hand and her left hand supports a nude child, whose two hands are brought up towards its mouth."}
