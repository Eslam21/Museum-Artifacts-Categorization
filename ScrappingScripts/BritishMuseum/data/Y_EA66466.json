Gorton included this scarab in her large group XXVIII A (Gorton 1996, 98, A142), though this type has normally only glazed composition scarabs and not Egyptian blue ones. Another Egyptian blue scarab, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.868, was assigned to that group (Gorton 1996, 98, A144a). BM 1886,0401.1638 would fit better her group XXX A: the motifs are similar to the ones found for her group XXVIII A, but they are roughly carved in coloured pastes and especially Egyptian blue (Gorton 1996, 109-111).
