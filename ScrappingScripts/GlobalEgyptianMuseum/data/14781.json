According to the legend of Osiris and Isis, Horus was the son of Osiris and became the avenger of his father after he had been murdered by Seth. When Osiris stayed as the king of the underworld and the dead, Horus became his heir and successor on the throne of Egypt. In the dynastic era, each king who sat upon the throne of Egypt became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Horus and his successor. The king's names also related him to Horus (the Horus name and the Golden Horus name), which would bestow extra protection on the king and kingship.The statue depicts the falcon Horus wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. It stands majestically, as if prepared to protect its dedicator. The eyes are large and outlined with relief and the beak is short and neat. Some detail has been carved on the body and wings"}
