Indeed had the gem engraver wished to show the man carrying out his own craft, he would have been hard-pressed to show the drill on a smaller scale. The scarab gem, carved in the shape of a beetle with the underside flat and engraved with various subject matter, unsurprisingly developed in Egypt. It was brought to Italy in the 5th century BC by Greeks and Phoenicians where it became extremely popular and was produced in large quantities by Etruscan craftsmen who made it their own. Typifying the Etruscan love of detail and authenticity, the Etruscan carved scarabs are more elaborate and accurate in the representation of the beetle than their Greek and Phoenician counterparts. Carnelian was the most popular Etruscan gemstone, and given the consistency of its red colour, as opposed to the variations used by Greek gem-carvers, it may have come from a single source in Italy.
