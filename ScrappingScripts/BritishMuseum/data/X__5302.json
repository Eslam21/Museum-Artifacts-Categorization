", " Bronze figures of Harpokrates were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods in Egypt (Weiss 2012, 126-157, Typ 41-69, Pl. 11-19), chiefly in the Delta where his cult was particularly developed (Sandri 2006). Likewise, the child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). This figure of Harpokrates belongs to the type 51 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a type that appears on a number of sites in the Delta (Weiss 2012, 138-139, 589-592, Pl. 14, see esp.
