", " The association of a falcon holding a flail with a half cartouche was popular on scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis (on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and in southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 103-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B1-12 and B13-14, but no specimen in the shape of cowroid is listed). Petrie illustrated variants of this association of an animal - often a falcon or a mythical creature - with a debased hieroglyphic inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 71-78). The hieroglyphs, as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93).
