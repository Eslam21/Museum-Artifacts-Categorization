{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:123", "Dating": "MODERN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Name": "Shabti", "Description": "Bronze shabti figure, cast of the front only, with long divine beard and wig-lappets typical of the Late Period. The casting of antiquities is attested in early modern collections within Europe, but not apparently inside Egypt. This shabti was acquired by Lady Harriet Kavanagh, who travelled in Egypt in the 1840s. It may be a rare 19th century cast from a faience original, rather than a Late Period original."}
