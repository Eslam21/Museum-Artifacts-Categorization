This was retrieved by the excavators of the cemetery at Sidmant, near Ihnasiya, the town site of ancient Henennesut (in Greek named as Heracleopolis). The range of flowers and their symbolism changed substantially in these later periods of Egyptian history, as a result of the greater contacts with India to the east and Europe to the north-west."}
