Petrie mentioned that a third of the objects was either broken or burnt (Petrie 1886, 41), such as this piece. The cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). Large amuletic figures of Sekhmet were perhaps produced in Naukratis. A terracotta mould to cast a figure of Sekhmet was discovered in the Scarab Factory (according to Museum records): Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45970.
