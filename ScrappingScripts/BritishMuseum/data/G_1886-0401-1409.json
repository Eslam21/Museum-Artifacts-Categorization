{"artifact_name": "theatre mask; figure", "Object Type": [" theatre mask ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1409"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta fitting (?) in form of comedy mask. A model of a dramatic mask, an Old Man from the New Comedy with a short beard or, less likely, a Slave. He has a wrinkled brow, heavy eyebrows, large eyeballs and a wide open mouth. Finished along its lower edge, it is broken away elsewhere. The start of the hair survives in one place only, low down on the mask\u2019s right side. Pressed into a one-piece mould, and the mouth cut out; the beard is striated by paring on the outside. No trace of lime wash, with paint added directly to surface of the model. Orange paint remains on the upper cheeks, below the eyes, and on the forehead, and red paint on the lips and the eyelids, both upper and lower. Green paint present on the eye ball, with black on the flat of the pupil. The beard does not appear to have been painted, left the natural brown of the fabric. Red-brown Nile silt with a grey core, abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions.
