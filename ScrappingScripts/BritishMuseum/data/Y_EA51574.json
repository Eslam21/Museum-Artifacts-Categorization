{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA51574"], "Description": [" Upper part of a sandstone female ba-figure. A remaining outline of the neck is still visible across the top of the stone. Though the head is now lost, it would likely have been human as attested by several other examples from this site and time period in which the human and bird form of the ba are intertwined. The back is heavily curved and the wings of the bird are undefined, with large abrasions across the surface of its proper left side. The figure has large drooping breasts. The upper arms are intact and hang by the sides of the body, while the base of the fragment gives an indication of her narrow waist. Small traces of yellow paint are visible across the winged back, and a thicker line of brown-red colour is visible between the right arm and wing, giving an indication of the once vibrant colours that adorned the body.
