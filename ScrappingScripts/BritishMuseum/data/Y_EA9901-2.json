Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Sheet primarily composed of lines of cursive hieroglyphic text written in black and red ink with black dividing lines. A yellow dividing line separates a smaller text unit on the right-hand side from the larger left part. Spell 183. In the middle and on the left-hand side are two polychrome vignettes with yellow borders. Middle vignette depicts Thoth holding a nb-sign with an ankh-sign flanked by two was-signs on top of it; no captions; main colours are yellow, blue, black, white and red. Left-hand vignette shows deceased and wife in adoration poses; two black cursive hieroglyphic captions are above and to the right of the figures; main colours are white, pink, black, yellow and green. Vignettes occupy about two-thirds height of composition and about a sixth of width. Composition fills the sheet; framed on top and bottom with red and yellow line. Very little text/image loss except for yellow paint which has faded. Bibliography: Kitchen. Ram. Insc. Vol 1, p. 306. Tarasenko, Mykola. 2016.
