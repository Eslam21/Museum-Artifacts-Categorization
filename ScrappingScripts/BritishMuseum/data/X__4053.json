This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This amulet does not bear any inscription on its underside and differs from known lion's scaraboids (style, paste/glaze, suspension hole or loop not present on lion's scaraboids) produced in the Scarab Factory. On lion amulets in general: Germond 2005, 30; Herrmann et al. 2010, 91-92. Such amulets have a long history. For examples dated to the Late and Ptolemaic periods: Dunham 1963, 42, fig. 28b (26th dynasty); Masson forthcoming (late 26th \u2013 early 27th dynasty); Wilson 1982, p. 32 (Late Period); Herrmann 1994, 121-122, n\u00b0618-627 (Persian and Ptolemaic periods). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised by) Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
