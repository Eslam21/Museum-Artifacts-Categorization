It means a sort of beer, normally made from grains of various kinds and sometimes from other substances. The early Islamic \u1e24ad\u012bth literature defines it variously as being made from wheat, barley or honey. A definition quoted by Ibn-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r mentions wheat, barley and millet. In modern Egypt, one is told, it refers principally to rice beer. As an intoxicant, 'mizr', whatever its ingredients, is forbidden by Islamic law. The historians of later periods mention episodes when the government of the time tried to suppress it, and others when it was content to tax it, or even attempt to monopolize its sale. The anonymous type published by Balog does look early. Miles 1971, 62, also anonymous, seems to be for 'mizr', though the reading is obscure immediately after the commodity. It is one of very few stamps which have both a denomination in ra\u1e6dls (2 ra\u1e6dls?) and a price (1 fals). The script indicates a date in the middle of the eighth century.
