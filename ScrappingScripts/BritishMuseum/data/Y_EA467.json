{"artifact_name": "shrine; stela", "Object Type": [" shrine ", " stela "], "Museum number": ["EA467"], "Description": [" The shrine-stela of Ineny: of limestone with a pyramidion, presumably from his tomb. On each side is a recess, similar to niches in large New Kingdom pyramidions in which stelophorous statues were placed. In each recess is a reduced version of such a statue, abbreviated to a stela with the face and hands of the worshipper above it. The name of the god Amun has been erased, presumably during the Amarna Period. Each niche is framed by symmetrically arranged lines of incised hieroglyphs recording the traditional offering formula. The hieroglyphs are noticeably more tightly spaced at the end of each line, as if the carver had misjudged the space available. The text on the stela itself is inscribed in four lines of incised hieroglyphs. The plinth is inscribed with a horizontal line of hieroglyphs.
