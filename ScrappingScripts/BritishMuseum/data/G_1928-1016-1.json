{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["1928,1016.1"], "Description": [" Pottery: coarse ware basket vase. A double-faced pot, oval in cross-section, with a basket-handle: on one side is the face of a maenad, with a frowning brow and prominent lines bracketing her dimpled chin; she has curls on top of her head and vertical locks falling to her brow and framing her face. The other side has the face of a young satyr with a closely woven wreath adorned with ivy berries crossing above his forehead, his hair showing above and falling beside his face. The resting-surface of the pot is slightly concave. Two-piece mould, with applied handle above. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with the remains of a white dressing outside and in, but not under the base; a little black paint survives on the eyes, and the face of the maenad is painted pink; the hair of the satyr has red paint, and pink paint was used on his wreath.
