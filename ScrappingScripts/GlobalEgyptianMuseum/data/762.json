Osiris, 'ruler of eternity and lord of the everlasting' is seated on a royal throne, his body wrapped in a funerary shroud and wearing a typical Osirian crown. In front of the throne stands a large lotus flower, on top of which are the four Sons of Horus. The god of the dead is accompanied by his spouse Isis and his son Horus, 'the avenger of his father'. The king is followed by a young man, the future Ramesses II, carrying a flail in his left hand. On the lower part of the stela, the owner Mai, who was attached to the temple of Sethos I at Abydos, is shown in an adoring attitude in front of an offering table."}
