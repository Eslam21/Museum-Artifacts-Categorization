", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This amulet might come from such a context. Though they appear already in the 18th dynasty (Andrews 1994, 81-82), wadj-column amulets are especially well attested between the 26th and 30th dynasty and persist in early ptolemaic contexts (Petrie 1914, 12; Wilson 1982, 31-32, pl. XXIX n\u00b01-2; Giddy 1992, pl. 49, 78/284, pl. 53, 78/86, pl. 77, 78/284; Masson forthcoming b; see also numerous Late Period references in Herrmann 2006, 228-229, KatNr. 440-446, Pl. XCIX C). Such amulets are usually associated to ideas of regeneration and youth (Andrews 1994, 81-82; Germond 2005, 24).
