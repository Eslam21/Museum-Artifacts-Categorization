See Matth\u00e4us 1985, 257-60 for a survey and discussion of the three known examples of this type found in Cyprus, two from Tomb 84. They are widely distributed in the Mediterranean. Vonhoff (2015, 280-1) considers the type to be a Phoenician version of a type first attested in Egypt from the time of the Bronze to Iron transition, though some features - such as the bird-headed handle - are found in Cyprus already in the Late Bronze Age (deriving from Near Eastern prototypes).
