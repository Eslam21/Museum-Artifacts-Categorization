A close parallel is from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525 BC - 400 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2115). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9). Probably from South Ionia, Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). Blinkenberg, C. 1931. Lindos.
