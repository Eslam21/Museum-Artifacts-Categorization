Cartouches are more often stamped on jar-sealings in the Late Period. See examples from Tell Dafana: jar-sealing with plumed cartouche of Nekau with the title \"son of Ra\" inside cartouche (EA 23793) and jar-sealing with plumed cartouche of Amasis (EA 23795) For a seal in situ on a jar, see EA 22356. See also a seal in bronze with plumed cartouche of Amasis including the title of \"perfect god\" (EA 23903). It was found in Tell Dafana and was probably used to stamp amphoras, usually jar-sealings as aforementioned (Petrie 1888, p. 77 \u00a7 76, p. 111, pl. xli, 76). Petrie, W.M. F. 1888.
