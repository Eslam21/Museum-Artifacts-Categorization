", " Button seals are usually produced between the Old and Middle Kingdom. The presence of such an early type of scaraboid in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). Another button seal decorated with a sema-tawy on its underside was discovered in Naukratis: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H3710 (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 160). A similar thicket of papyrus decorates a cowroid with a patterned back, also found in Naukratis: BM 1888,0601.69 (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 159).
