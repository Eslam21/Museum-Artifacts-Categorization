Ragged fragment, probably from a wool garment, woven from yellow yarn (S-spun), 12\u201314/13 threads per cm.

The figurative pattern with lotus-flowers, fish and a putto outlined in dark blue may be compared with that on the \u2018Sabine shawl\u2019 from Albert Gayet\u2019s excavations at Antinoupolis in 1902\u20131903 now in the Louvre and other collections (Rutschowscaya 2004).
