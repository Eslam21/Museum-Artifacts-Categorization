{"artifact_name": "battle-axe", "Object Type": ["battle-axe"], "Museum number": ["EA67479"], "Description": [" Axe-head: the ends of the lateral tangs are irregular and the central tang tapers towards the rear. The blade has a broad mid-rib flanked by a series of furrowed bands and ridges, which are decorative and were produced by chasing. Unusually for this type, the rear edge of the blade around the scallops is flanged. The blade is slightly warped and is thickly corroded in parts. The cutting edge bears a number of small indentations. The accompanying haft is a roughly cylindrical wooden stick, now broken at the bottom, which is still partially covered by bark. It has three narrow sockets for the tangs, which fit quite well. The bark bears the clear impression of the original binding. "], "Cultures/periods": [" First Intermediate (?) ", " Middle Kingdom (?)
