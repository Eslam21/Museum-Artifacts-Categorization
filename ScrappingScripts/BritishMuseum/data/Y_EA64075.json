It was presumably intended as a representation of the god Anubis. The object displays a number of stylistic peculiarities which suggest that it is a forgery: for example, the very short snout and the deep, squat face. The ears are not positioned symmetrically and are anatomically inaccurate. X-ray diffraction analysis of the lapis luzuli has now revealed the presence of a calcium silicate, wollastonite. This mineral is not present in the lapis from Badakshan, Afghanistan, which is thought to have been used in Egypt, but is a characteristic impurity of lapis from Lake Baikal, Siberia, a deposit which was not exploited until the nineteenth century AD. In view of this the modern origin of the head becomes a virtual certainty."], "Bibliographic references": ["Jones 1990a / Fake?
