Due to its weight and the small central hole this fragment could have been, together with B 433b, a flywheel mass for tools (drill, lathe). If its context should be truly the Apollo temenos, this fragment could also be considered as a craftsman\u2019s votive. The latter has three circle incised and not spirals, like Pryce suggests (Dm 4.4 cm, 7 cm, 9 cm).
