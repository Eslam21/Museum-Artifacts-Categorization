Petrie originally described it as having \u2018an early Greek scroll pattern\u2019 (Petrie 1886, 43); however, its shape, size and material is similar to rings from 6th and 5th century BC Cypriot tombs (British Museum 1969,0401.38 and 1969,0401.174). The spiral motif is known from Egyptian scarabs of the Middle Kingdom onwards, and some Cypriot scarabs dated to the 7th or 6th century BC (British Museum 1894,1101.425). Three spirals were used as a cryptic form of the name of Amun-Ra on Egyptian amulets (Drioton 1957, 11\u201333), and therefore this piece may be a reinterpretation or misunderstanding of the original Egyptian meaning.
