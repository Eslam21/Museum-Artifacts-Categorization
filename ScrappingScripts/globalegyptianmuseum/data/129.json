Inside a rectangle in the centre of the stone slab stands as protector the falcon god Horus, to whom the king is assimilated, while below is a schematically represented palace enclosure. Inside this enclose may be seen the (so-called Horus) name of the king, the reading of which is uncertain. Den is currently the most favoured reading, but some Egyptologists prefer Udimu or even Niudi. This funerary stela from the royal cemetery at Abydos was placed in front of the king's mastaba and was one of a pair."}
