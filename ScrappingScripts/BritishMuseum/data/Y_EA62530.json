{"artifact_name": "bead; amulet", "Object Type": [" bead ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA62530"], "Description": [" Amuletic string: the electrum eye amulet is not a wedjat but the hieroglyphic sign of an eye. There are three gold cylinder disc beads and three gold barrel beads, the latter made of foil. The black material showing in the join of one bead is not core material but apparently the same resinous compound which covers some of the other beads. The gold spiral bead is made from a flat piece of gold wire twisted into seven coils with space between each twist. There are two long truncated convex bicones and a long, thin cylinder, all of green feldspar. The cornelian beads consist of one long barrel, three short barrels and two cylinders. A single long cylinder and eight short cylinders and discs, all of turquoise, complete the string.
