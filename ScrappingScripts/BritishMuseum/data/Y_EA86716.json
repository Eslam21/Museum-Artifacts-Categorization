{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86716"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression with impressions of basketry coil at the rear and at the side, probably from the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica. The top part is broken away except for the most part of the impression of a scarab-like seal. It shows three figures in striding position and arms parallel to the bodies. The figure at the left is a falcon headed deity, facing to the right, the figure in the middle is Amun with the double feather crown, facing to the left. The head of the third figure at the right side of Amun is not preserved but the figure was facing to the left and was either a third deity or pharaoh. The seal impression looks like it was distorted by some plant remains or the seal was not cut very well. The same motif (but probably not the same seal) was used on EA86712.
