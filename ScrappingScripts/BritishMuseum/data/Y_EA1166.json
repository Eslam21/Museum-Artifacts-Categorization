{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1166"], "Description": [" Limestone relief from tomb of Khnumhotep: this panel, which is carved in good, shallow, sunk relief, shows Khnumhotep seated before an offering-table loaded with conventionalized sliced loaves of bread; he is represented wearing official dress with leopard-skin. To the right and below the offering-table is an enumeration of funerary offerings. Above are the titles and name of Khnumhotep. Near the top is a single red line. Much colour still remains: the flesh of the principal figure is coloured red, the wig black, the leopard-skin yellow; the chair is yellow, the sliced loaves alternately yellow and black. Most of the signs are without colour but a few show traces of having been blue completely; one has a green top and dark blue bottom; the wig of the head symbol is black.
