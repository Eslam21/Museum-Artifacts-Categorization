However this was registered with pieces labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary, during Gardner\u2019s season at Naukratis in 1885-1886. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Cow figurines were popular votives used during the worship of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, here probably associated with the cult of Aphrodite. Hand-made quadruped animals were made by adding sausages of clay, and pinching or impressing details to the clay. Relatively poorly represented at Naukratis (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston RES.87.219, RES.87.217, 86.423; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge GR.15.1899, GR.37.1887, E.237.1899; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896- 1908-E.4788, AN1886.507; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA626, NA624), considering this is usually a common figure in Late Period Nile Delta sites. The animals primarily represent bulls or cows, though rams may also be represented and this is not always clear.
