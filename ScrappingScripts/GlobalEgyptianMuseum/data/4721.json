{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "176", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; ENGRAVED", "Height": "27.2 cm", "Width": "19.8 cm", "Depth": "5.5 cm", "Name": "Stela of Reny-seneb", "Description": "A rectangular stela with rounded top. Both scenes and texts are carved. The representations are all painted in monochrome green and have no inner detail. The paint is remarkably well preserved. The decorated part is framed on three sides by a simple carved line, along the bottom by three carved lines. Underneath this, however, there appear to be still more (less important ?) scenes and texts. The stripes between the border and the edge of the stone as well as the bottom lines have been painted black. The front surface of the stela has been smoothed and polished well, the sides to a lesser extent. Some chisel marks can still be seen. The back has received minimal attention. Simple lines divide the registers."}
