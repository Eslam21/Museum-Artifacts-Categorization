{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA880"], "Description": [" Fragment from the throne of a calcite royal statue. The fragment preserves two columns of incised text, executed to a high quality, with the beginning of the inscription now missing. The text records the names and titles of the king Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti. The final section of text from the second column on the right side is now lost, though parts of the initial signs are visible. In addition to the breaks at the top and bottom of the fragment, there are chips to the surface along the edges of the stone, and a large chip to the left side at the sign immediately underneath the cartouche. Small chips are also visible across the text but these do not impair the reading of the text.
