{"artifact_name": "sarcophagus; lid", "Object Type": [" sarcophagus ", " lid "], "Museum number": ["EA78"], "Description": [" Red granite sarcophagus lid of Setau: a massive anthropoid sarcophagus lid inscribed with texts for the viceroy of Kush, Setau. On the lid, beneath the head, is a seated figure of Nut, who is named, and beneath this a single column of text with a prayer to Nut on behalf of Setau. A line of text runs around the edge of the lid below the shoulders, interrupted at intervals by short lines of text inscribed at right angles to the main line, creating six panels on the lower half of the lid. The main text consists of two balancing inscriptions which begin at each shoulder, both containing standard sarcophagus texts addressed to Geb and Nut. The transverse bands of text, five on each side, presumably continued from the lid down the sides of the sarcophagus which is now lost. In the four upper texts on each side Setau, whose name is lost, is described as a person revered before various funerary and canopic deities: on one side [name lost] either Hapy or Amsety, Anubis, Duamutef and Geb; and on the other side [name lost] either Hapy or Amsety, Anubis, Qebhsenuef and Dunanwy. The fifth transverse line on each side contains the name and titles of Setau. The six panels on the lower part of the sarcophagus contain figures in sunk relief and incised texts. In the upper four panels Setau is shown adoring various deities before each of whom is an altar with offerings: Osiris in the upper two scenes; Anubis and Hapy in the lower scenes. The two panels at the foot of the coffin depict, in opposite order to the rest of the scenes and inscriptions, the goddesses Isis and Nephthys in an attitude of mourning. The lid has been broken in two and rejoined in modern times. The foot of the lid is damaged and the foot-end is lost. There are no traces of colour.

Setau appears to have been of Theban origin and, prior to his viceregal appointment, held the rank of chief steward of Amun at Thebes. He held office in Kush at least from Years 38 to 44 of Ramses II. He was buried in Tomb 289 of the Theban necropolis together with his wife Nefretmut who may have originated from El-Kab.
