{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA64653"], "Description": [" Spheroidal vase of variegated limestone: with pink, white and black veining. The rim is flat-topped with a sharp outer edge and the interior is fairly well hollowed. On the shoulder of the vase are two tubular handles, both covered by rectangular gold plates with an openwork cross cut in the middle. The handles still contain loops of copper wire, covered with gold foil. The base was drilled right through for ease of hollowing, and would have been plugged by a separate piece of stone, now missing. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 1st Dynasty (?) ", " 2nd Dynasty (?)
