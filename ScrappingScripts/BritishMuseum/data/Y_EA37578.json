{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37578"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta figure of Hathor, naked, with her hands to her sides. She has Isis-locks falling onto her shoulders, and wears an elaborate headdress of bound and leafy wreaths, with the ties hanging down beside her arms; it is surmounted by a large 'kalathos' with a notched upper edge: the surface of the 'kalathos' is eroded, and it may have had a Hathor/Isis crown in relief on the front. She has bracelets, an armlet on her left arm, and an anklet on her right leg. There is only summary treatment at the rear, including six long locks of hair, rather eroded. Circular vent. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with a dark-brown surface. Black paint on the hair in front; pale-pink traces on the lowest wreath.
