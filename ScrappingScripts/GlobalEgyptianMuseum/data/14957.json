It has a small handle, by which it could be suspended, and a clapper. The four corners of the bell's sides are clearly pointed. The bell was considered in Ancient Egypt to be an idiophone musical instrument, together with the clappers, the sistrum and the cymbals. Bells were particularly associated with worship in the temples. The Egyptian Museum collections attest to the many forms and sizes of bells, which have round, square, rectangular, or oval bases."}
