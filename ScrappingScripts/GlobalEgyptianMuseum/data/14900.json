The god wears his characteristic crown with the tall plumes and a long sacred beard. The upper lintel of the naos bears a double scene, back to back, of King Amenhotep the third, wearing the Khepresh Blue Crown of ceremonies, offering and praying to Amun-Re. The vertical texts on both edges are a dedicatory text of King Amenhotep: \"the good god, lord of the Two Lands, Neb-Maat-Ra, son of Re, Amenhotep, ruler of Thebes, beloved of Amun-Re, lord of the thrones of the two lands.\" During the time of King Ramesses the second, nearly 140 years after the naos was placed in Karnak by King Amenhotep, the \"Hereditary Prince, Overseer of the priests of all gods and the chief priest of Amun-Re (named Bak-en-Khonsu),\" ordered his name and titles to be incised at the sides of the naos, in order to participate in the offerings presented to Amun-Re and at the same time to show his respect to the original dedicator."}
