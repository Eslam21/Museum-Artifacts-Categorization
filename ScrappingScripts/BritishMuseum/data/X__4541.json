", " The hieroglyphs in the \"half cartouche\", as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93), a recurrent element on the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d products (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). The identification of the rest of the motif is far more difficult considering the bad state of preservation. The EEF distribution list suggest a \"winged sphinx seated (?)\". A better preserved specimen corresponding to that description would be BM 1886,0401.1650 (Gorton 1996, type XXX A17). It could also be a falcon holding a flail, such as Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.695 (Gorton 1996, type XXVIII B2) or even a hieroglyphic inscription as seen on Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.696 (Gorton 1996, type XXVIII C8).
