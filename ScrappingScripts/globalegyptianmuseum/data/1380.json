A bivalve amulet, crossed by a sort of spine, that the man wears on his chest, is very particular and offers an indication of chronology. First attested under the Middle Kingdom, it reappeared at the end of the 25th Dynasty up to the beginning of the 26th Dynasty. It is therefore very probable that our person lived in this period of transition. "}
