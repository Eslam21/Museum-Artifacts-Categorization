", " For a parallel regarding the shape and decoration, see the krater in Walter-Karydi 1973, pl. 20, no. 166 from Tarsus. Cook suggests that Oxford AN1925.608b belongs to the same vase as Boston 86.636 and Cairo CG26152. In the first instance, it is unclear to which of two Oxford AN1925.608b sherds Cook is referring (this one or AN1925.608b(8)). The tongue band on this sherd is framed by narrow black lines and the circumference of the neck suggests that the vessel is a krater and not a closed vessel. On the other hand, there is added red on the lotus flower's kalyx and there is no evidence of added red on any of the other sherds, thus suggesting the sherd belongs to a completely different vessel. There is a single black band above the lotus flower and lotus bud on the Boston sherd. Finally, there is no narrow black band between the tongues and the flowers on the Cairo sherd.
