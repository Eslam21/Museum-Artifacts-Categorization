", " The sherd NA165 joins Reading 26.2.90 and Boston 86.631 and may also belong to the same vase as Alexandria 9488. The vase is probably by a painter in the Three Maidens Group (Early-Middle Corinthian). For the drawing of the floral elements and the proportion of lotus to palmette, see the Basle krater (private collection) (Benson 1956, pl. 75, figs 34-35), which Benson (1969, 120, no. B 1a) attributes to the manner of the Memnon Painter. The sherd Louvre E 630 (Payne 1931, 154, fig. 62c; NC 1181D) is attributed by Benson (1969, 120, D2) to the Detroit Painter. Benson, J. L.
