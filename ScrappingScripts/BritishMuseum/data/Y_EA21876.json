{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA21876"], "Description": [" A pottery flask in the form of a satyr, modelled in the round. He squats on the ground, holding a striated drinking-cup between his knees with both hands. He has a frowning brow and receding hair: a deep V-shaped plain element at the rear, running from his head to mid-back, may be long hair, or the tail of a hood. A short-necked opening rises from the top of his head and is flanked by small ring-handles. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, covered with a mottled red-brown slip.
