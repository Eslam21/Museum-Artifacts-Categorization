", " A perfect pendant to the inscription on that scarab was discovered in Vulci (scarab in glazed steatite: H\u00f6lbl 1979, II, 67-8, pl. 80/3, no. 329). Not only the inscription is similar but the style of the hieroglyphs are comparable. H\u00f6lbl suggests a date before the mid-7th century BC (H\u00f6lbl 1979, I, 147).
