The raw glass itself might thus have been an import from the Levantine area. However, this does not exclude that the vessel was worked in Naukratis."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (FE.08)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886 (?)"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["2011,5009.303"]}
