{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86923"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration with a partly glossy surface. The rear shows two sides with two rows of basketry coil each, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front has a small flat area with slightly downwards bending sides. On the flat area parts of an oval scarab-like seal-impression. Visible is a thin circumferential line. In the lower middle part a stylised nbw sign (Gardiner S12), above it a horizontal oval field with a line, inside a spiral that continued further to the left. To the left of the nbw-sign there is an ankh. The same motif is found on EA86820 and EA86920 and the latter shows that a small nfr-sign was positioned at the right end of the seal.
