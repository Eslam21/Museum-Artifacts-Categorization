{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA27332"], "Description": [" Wooden funerary stela of Deniuenkhons: Deniuenkhons wears a long, full wig embellished with a floral fillet, a perfume cone, and lotuses. Her voluminous pleated robe is sheer enough to reveal the flesh creases on her belly and her rather plump hips and thighs. Deniuenkhonsu worships a falcon-headed god named Ra-Horakhty-Atum, a composite or synthesis of all the main solar gods. The all-inclusiveness of this figure is borne out by his regalia: in addition to the cobra-encircled sun disk on his head and the 'ankh' sign in one hand, he holds a crook and flail, usually associated with Osiris, and the was scepter in his other hand is crowned by the feather of Maat and another 'ankh'. Solar imagery dominates the arch of the stela. Under a blue border representing the sky, the winged sun disk, propelled by the scarab beetle, rises from his nocturnal travels in the Underworld, symbolized by two figures of the jackal god, Anubis. The offerings include lotuses; a plucked, eviscerated fowl; a bowl of grapes (?); round, decorated loaves of bread; and, beneath the table, two stalks of cos lettuce and a beer jar set in a stand and wound with a lotus stem. The lower border of the stela is a reddish strip lined with a row of little green plants. Since red and pink were used to represent desert land , in contrast to the black earth of the Nile Valley, this must represent a plant-bedecked strip of desert.
