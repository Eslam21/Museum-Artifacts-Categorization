{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37559"], "Description": [" Hollow terracotta figure of Harpokrates reclining on the back of a goose; he wears a himation, extending from his left shoulder and covering him from the waist down, leaving his legs free below the knees. A Double Crown surmounts his hair, and lappets of a ribbon emerge from behind his head to fall on his shoulders. His finger is to his mouth and he holds a cornucopia in the crook of his left arm. The goose stands stolidly, with its foot on a flat-faced plinth. Back plain, except for a raised rim round a circular vent. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with a brown surface. Traces of an overall white dressing. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Roman Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
