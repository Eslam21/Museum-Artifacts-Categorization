It comes from a statuette originally erected in a temple. Later, the broken head was used as a grinding stone. The lower parts of the striated wig, which originally reached the shoulders, are very worn away. The large protruding ears were not covered by the wig. The nose is almost completely broken off. In spite of the damage, this head can be dated to the reign of King Amenemhat III because of its great similarity with heads of this king."}
