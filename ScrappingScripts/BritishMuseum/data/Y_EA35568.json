{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA35568"], "Description": [" Squat vase of the higher type, made of magnesite: the mouth is very narrow and it has a raised external rim. It is closed by a thin gold cover, secured by two turns of gold wire, twisted together at the ends. The cover is decorated with punch-marks, made from the underside. The base has been drilled right through to facilitate the hollowing of the interior, and would originally have been closed by a separate piece of stone, now missing.
