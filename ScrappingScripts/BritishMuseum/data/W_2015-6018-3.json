Her artistic training began in Egypt in 1965 and continued in London where she studied painting and printmaking at St Martin\u2019s School of Art between 1976 and 1978. A love of tradition and a desire to record it in the face of Saudi Arabia\u2019s rapid modernisation has influenced Safeya\u2019s choice of subject matter. She built a museum called Darat Safeya Binzagr, which opened in 1995, to house both her paintings and a growing collection of costume and jewellery from Saudi Arabia. The Darat Safeya Binzagr is an important cultural institution in Jeddah, not only as an art gallery but also as a meeting place for artists, intellectuals and students.
