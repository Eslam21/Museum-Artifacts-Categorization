Closest parallel for the form, but in a different fabric is a duck vase from Kamiros BM1867,0508.866, originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1959: 35), but possibly Ionian as per BM1888,0601.752b that has a similar fabric (Jones 1985: 670). Higgins' East Greek classification is confirmed by Jones' NAA analysis of BM1888,0601.659 that places it within his East Greek, possibly Milesian group (Jones 1985: 673). Jones erroneously identifies this as 1888,0601.654. NAA suggests this is the same fabric as GR 1888,0601.605. Jones, R. E. 1985. Greek and Cypriot Pottery: A Review of Scientific Studies.
