", " Sow amulets are associated to ideas of fecundity and to the sky-goddess Nut. They start to be popular with the Third Intermediate Period, though they were already produced in the Late New Kingdom: (Herrmann et al. 2010, no. 4) and are common during the Late Period (Andrews 1994, 35, fig. 32; Germond 2005, no. 6-7; Herrmann et al. 2010, 94).
