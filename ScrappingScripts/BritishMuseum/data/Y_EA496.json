{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA496"], "Description": [" Fragmentary basalt figure of the god Osiris, only the upper body remaining. The god wears a wide broad collar with individual rows of beaded detail, and the outline of his now missing false beard is visible in the centre. His arms were crossed across his chest, as shown by the remains of the heqa-crook on his right side, while across his left side he would have held a flail. A thin part of the flail is still intact across this area, though most of this is now badly damaged and his hands are also lost. The intact right side of the upper body also confirms that the god adopted his traditional mummified form, with the outline of the elbow underneath the material still visible. On the reverse is a section of a slim back-pillar, now badly damaged and with no clear traces of an inscription. In addition to the loss of the head, lower body, and back-pillar, the left side of the body has been reconstructed in modern times.
