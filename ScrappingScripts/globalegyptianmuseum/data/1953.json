{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:712", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-RUBIYAT", "Category": "MASK", "Material": "GESSO; LINEN; GOLD", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; PAINTED; GILDED", "Height": "40 cm", "Width": "23 cm", "Name": "Mummy-mask of painted and gilded cartonnage", "Description": "Gilt painted cartonnage mask in Egyptian style, from the early Roman Period cemeteries at el-Rubiyat in the Faiyum. The workmanship is of the highest quality, and the delicate material is still in exceptionally good condition. In the first centuries BC and AD, the Faiyum was a prosperous province, and the local elite continued to use Pharaonic traditions in mummification and funerary equipment. The back of the head is decorated with a winged scarab beetle supporting the solar disc, emblem of rebirth, flanked by adoring baboons. Each wig lappet is painted with the human-headed Ba-bird, pairs of Anubis jackals on shrines, rows of rearing cobras wearing sun disks, and, below, figures of (left) Osiris and (right) a falcon-headed god, either the sun-god Re or the funerary earth-god Sokar. Beside the lappet ends is a udjat-eye on each side, guaranteeing the restored health and life of the deceased after death. Rosettes adorn the lower band, and the rich floral collar includes a thick bead at the centre below the neck, a talisman featuring in burials since the Middle Kingdom, two thousand years earlier. A thick cylindrical bead is painted at the neck of the early Roman Period painted panel portrait 1902.4, also from el-Rubiyat."}
