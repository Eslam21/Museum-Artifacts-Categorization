They were found in an anonymous tomb together with other items belonging to King Seti the Second and his consort, Queen Tausert. Thieves who had violated the couple's burial place probably used this tomb as a hiding place. Possibly they were arrested and never came back to collect the jewelry.Each bracelet is composed of two parts joined by a hinge and a clasp. The main part is decorated with a scene that shows the queen offering the pharaoh a vase and a flower. The king is seated on a throne with his feet shown as the paws of a lion; he is holding a cup in his left hand and a palm leaf in his right."}
