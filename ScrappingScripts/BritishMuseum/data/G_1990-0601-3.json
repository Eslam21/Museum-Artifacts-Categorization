An inkwell with bowl-shaped body and two pierced lug-handles, one on each side, rising from the outer rim. The almost enclosed, slightly domed top has concentric mouldings, with a rosette round the dip-hole and a stylized eggand- dart pattern near the edge. The dip-hole has a lowered edge within the body to guard against spillage. The body is plain except for double volutes in relief below the lugs, and the bottom has an angular rosette within the base-ring. Two-piece mould, the join horizontal just below the rim. Micaceous dark grey-brown Nile silt with a black slip overall (Memphis Black Ware).
