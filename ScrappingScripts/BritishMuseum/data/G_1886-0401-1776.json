{"artifact_name": "stove", "Object Type": ["stove"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1776"], "Description": [" Terracotta cooking stove fragment. A pot-support broken from a cooking-stove. This differs from most in that the pot-rest, which is plain and conical, is placed high on a raised round-topped panel, well above the rim of the bowl. At the back is part of a sunken horizontal rectangle with a simple raised wave pattern within; below is part of a sunken rounded device, also with a wave pattern, following its shape. None of the fire-bowl survives, but it was probably wheel-made, and the support and panel hand-modelled. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a red and grey core, the top of the support and the side of the panel darkened by use.
