{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "1082 (=7)", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY (not before); 13TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "31 cm", "Width": "19.5 cm", "Depth": "5 cm", "Name": "Stela of imnii-snb(.w)", "Description": "Round-topped stela, with incised decoration and traces of red pigment across surface, best preserved at edges. The roundel contains the wAD.tj motif, with 3 horizontal lines of hieroglyphs below (Inscription A), an offering-table scene, and 2 horizontal lines of hieroglyphic inscription at the bottom (Inscription B). The opening hieroglyphs of the last line contain slight traces of blue pigment. The scene of offerings shows at the centre a tall stand supporting a bowl, depicted as joining directly a shorter offering-table laden with two round loaves and two piriform loaves. On either side is shown a man with short wig and long kilt, seated on a lion-legged stool. The man on the left wears a plain collar, and extends one hand along the leg; the other hand was originally shown stretched to-wards the offerings, but the pose was then corrected to depict him holding the hand to the chest. The man on the right, with face erased, has one hand stretched along the leg, the other towards the offerings. A vertical line of crudely incised hieroglyphs (Inscrip-tion C) occupies the space behind the left-hand chair."}
