{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7571", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS ?", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "FULL CAST; CASTING; ENGRAVED", "Height": "13.5 cm", "Width": "2.8 cm", "Depth": "3.7 cm", "Name": "Ptah", "Description": "This statuette depicts the Memphite god Ptah standing on a platform in the form of the hieroglyph for 'Maat'. His head is covered with a cap which follows the shape of his skull, and his chin is elongated by a false beard. The god is covered with a tight-fitting robe which envelops his slim body, the only part of him visible being his hands which hold a was-sceptre; he also wears a broad 'wesekh' collar. The large ears are perhaps not unrelated to his divine epithet 'he who listens to prayers'. On the base is a short text which emphasises the votive character of the piece."}
