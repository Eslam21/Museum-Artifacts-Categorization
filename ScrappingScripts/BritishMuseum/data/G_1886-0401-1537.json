A mould-made model sword and its scabbard, with a ribbed handle and quadruple-balled pommel, the guard of pedimental form enclosing a raised stud. The blade has been pared. The separate scabbard has reinforced edgings, each terminating in a loop at the bottom and plain horizontal mouldings, probably representing metal bindings; there is a loop for suspension on each side near the top. The backs of both the sword and the scabbard are plain; both were made in two-piece moulds. Brown Nile silt with a reddish core and abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions (<1.5mm).
