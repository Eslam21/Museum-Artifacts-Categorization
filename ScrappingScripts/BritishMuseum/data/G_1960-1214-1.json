A sealing, on the face of which, in relief within a beaded circle, are facing busts of Sarapis and Isis, flanking a standing figure of Tyche (?) with a cornucopia, or, less probably, Harpokrates; below Sarapis, Nike stands to right, winged and holding a palm branch and wreath; below Isis, Neilos reclines, with a branch or stem of wheat, and a cornucopia. Surrounding the circle, also in relief, is an inscription. The back is concave and rough, impressed upon an uncertain surface, probably cloth and perhaps comprising the outer wrapping of a bale. Two holes in the edge, for string, now burnt out, run more or less parallel from side to side. Nile silt, with white inclusions, fired, probably accidentally, red-brown to brown.
