The form of the head is exceptional: the skull is elongated and the angular face is cut under the chin. The features of the face are equally remarkable: triangular brow, eyes marked with double lines, flat nose, badly formed lips and a small goatee beard. The face is entirely defined by a large wig which falls down onto the shoulders and the chest and which goes past the ears, depicted in frontal style. The verso side shows a head in profile of average quality."}
