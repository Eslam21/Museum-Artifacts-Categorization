John, knife in his right hand, about to swallow a French ship speared on his fork, says: \"What! more Frigasees? - why you sons o' bitches, you, where do ye think I shall find room to stow all you bring in? - \" In the foreground is Nelson, in profile to the left, his face bearing scars; from his pocket hangs a 'List of French Ships Taken Burnt & destroy[ed]'. His dish is 'Fricass\u00e9e \u00e0 la Nelson'. Howe, full-face, is the centre of the group with 'Fricando \u00e0 la Howe'. Warren holds up 'Desert \u00e0 la Warren'. Behind Nelson (right) is Duncan, whose dish contains 'Dutch Cheese [bis] \u00e0 la Duncan'. The other three are less characterized, their dishes are: 'a la Gardiner', '\u00e0 la Bridport', and '\u00e0 la Vincent'. Behind appears the head of an eighth officer. On the wall behind John Bull hangs a hat with a ribbon inscribed 'Nelson'; it obscures a print of 'Buonaparte in Egypt'. On the floor stands a large frothing jug of 'True British Stout', decorated with the Royal Arms. The table is laid with crossed cannons, a dish of battered ships: 'Soup and Bouilli'; and side-dishes containing small gunboats. Through an open window leaders of the Opposition are seen in flight, with upraised arms: Fox says, \"Oh, Curse his Guts! he'll take a Chop at Us, next.\" Next him is Sheridan. 24 October 1798 Hand-coloured etching "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: James Gillray ", " Published by: Hannah Humphrey "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1798"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 262 millimetres ", " Width: 362 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VII, 1942) One of many prints illustrating the exultation at Nelson's victory, see BMSat 9250, &c.
