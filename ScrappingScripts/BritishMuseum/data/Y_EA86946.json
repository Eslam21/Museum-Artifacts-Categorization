{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86946"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows two coils of basketry on one side and one row on the other, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. At the flat upper side one almost complete preserved impression of an oval scarab-like seal are visible. It shows a circumferential line and two figures. The one on the left is only partly preserved but seems to be an upright uraeus with a double crown, facing towards the left. On the right a standing deity, facing to the left, holding a staff in front of the body, probably Sekhmet, with a sun disc above the head. Between the two figures a small vertical sign, similar to aA (Gardiner O29).
