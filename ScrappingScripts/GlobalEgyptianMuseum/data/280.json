Phillips collection at Paris in 1905. It depicts a god with the head of an animal whose identification is difficult to discern. Represented standing, the person holds his left fist, in which he held an attribute which has disappeared, forward. On the head, one notices the base of the crown which the god wore. If one sees the head as that of a ram (?), it could be a figurine of the Theban god Amun."}
