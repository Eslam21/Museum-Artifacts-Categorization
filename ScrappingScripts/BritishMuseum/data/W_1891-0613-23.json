It certainly looks like \u1e25\u0101' or its equivalents, leading Balog to identify the substance as rakham, which he translates 'sour milk'. However, when the last letter is clear it can be seen to be an ordinary 'tooth-letter'. Miles and Vir\u00e9's reading, zayt, is undoubtedly correct. In the series of qis\u1e6d-system stamps for olive oil the quarter-qis\u1e6d denomination is normally much the most common, and for \u1e24ayy\u0101n.b. Shuray\u1e25 one is required to accompany the half-qis\u1e6d and qis\u1e6d types. Miles 1948, 10, identified as a quarter-qis\u1e6d of olive-oil, is certainly not that, though a convincing reading of the type has yet to be proposed. See OA+ 4335.
