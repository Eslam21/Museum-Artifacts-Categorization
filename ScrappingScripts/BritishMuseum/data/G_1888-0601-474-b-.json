For parallels regarding the exterior decoration and shape, compare the sherd with British Museum 1888,0601.474.a, which Lemos describes as belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices because it is a large and heavy-walled chalice-krater. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1). British Museum 1888,0601.474.b could also be included in this group."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1580) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["sphinx"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.474.b.+"], "Joined objects": [" Joined Object Group: G16220 (3 objects) "]}
