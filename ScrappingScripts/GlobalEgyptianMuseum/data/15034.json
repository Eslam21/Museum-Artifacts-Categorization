Osiris is in his characteristic pose holding his two scepters, the crook and the flail. He also wears the Atef crown. Isis wears a tripartite wig with cow horns, the sun disk on top, and a uraeus, or royal cobra, on the front. Her right hand holds the Ankh, the sign of life; and her left hand passes behind the shoulders of her husband, Osiris. The pharaoh wears the Nemes headdress with the royal uraeus. The face of the deity, obviously Horus, who sits next to the king, has been destroyed. The slightly protruding eyes and full cheeks of the figures are typical of late Eighteenth Dynasty sculpture."}
