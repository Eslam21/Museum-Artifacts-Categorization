{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA73548"], "Description": [" A terracotta figure of a man, probably but not certainly standing, blowing a cylindrical wind-instrument which he holds to his mouth with both hands. He has a pointed head and pinched-out eyes, nose and ears. Of the legs, only the upper thighs survive, projecting from below a loincloth of grass or string wrapped round and sealed with pitch or glue. There is an off-centre hole pierced in his torso at navel level, through which some strands of the grass or string pass, or possibly the stem of a plant. The top of his head is damaged. Solid; hand-modelled. Brown Nile silt with some mica. Traces of an overall cream-coloured slip. Minute signs of red fired-on ceramic colour remain on the body and under the musical instrument; pink colour below the nose.
