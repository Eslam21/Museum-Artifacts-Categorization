{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6662", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD (not before); 26TH DYNASTY; LATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS/CARTONNAGE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING; ENGRAVED", "Height": "6.7 cm", "Width": "4.4 cm", "Name": "Ichneumon", "Description": "This rectangular sarcophagus in bronze is surmounted by a finely worked ichneumon figurine. On the front panel of the sarcophagus, the inscription in two lines tells us that this piece was consecrated to the goddess Wadjet, which is  rather remarkable seeing that  the ichneumon was above all the animal sacred to the god Mekhenty-irty, that is to say Horus of Letopolis. The object bears the name of Amenirdis, son of Psammetik-aoui-Nieth and Ireterou."}
