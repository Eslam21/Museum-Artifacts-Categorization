{"artifact_name": "buckle", "Object Type": ["buckle"], "Museum number": ["1923,0716.81"], "Description": [" Buckle; bronze; complete with tongue and plate in the form of an open-work palmette; three attachment loops on the back. Andr\u00e1si 2008 Copper-alloy buckle with an openwork palmette on the plate. Oval loop and rectangular-section tongue. The copper-alloy plate is cast in one piece together with the loop. It consists of a semicircular frame of flat, rectangular section, with a small rectangular projection at the end. The frame contains an openwork, three-leaved palmette projecting from behind the tongue into the centre. There is an incised line all along the outer edge of the frame which interlocks with another such line below the tongue running round the edge of the palmette. The back is flat with three perforated, cast attachment lugs. The oval loop is rectangular in section, narrowing along both sides and expanding towards the tongue-rest. There is a triangular panel on each side of the tongue-rest, decorated with an incised triangle containing transverse, incised lines. The loop is only slightly flattened for the tongue-rest. The tongue is rectangular in section with a cast lug above the base and a similar, but smaller, lug towards the end of the tongue. The tongue is hooked through a perforation in the top of the plate. The hook of the tongue is cast in one piece with it. The hook of the tongue is imperfect. This buckle has been heavily cleaned, so nothing can be concluded about the decoration.
