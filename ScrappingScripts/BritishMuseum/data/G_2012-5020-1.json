Base surface of mould is completely flat, unlike the majority of Naukratis moulds, which are slightly concave. No exact parallels amongst BM scaraboids from Naukratis, although other types of African head are found, some mould made, while others are smaller, and cut by hand. Museum impression makes it clear that this is Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 11. ", " Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Scaraboids in the shape of a Black African head are a standard production at Naukratis. Petrie listed a number of variants for Black African head scaraboid-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 8-11, especially 11). For a very close parallel to this type of African head, see Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4570.6: they both seem to come from the same master. Gorton, A.
