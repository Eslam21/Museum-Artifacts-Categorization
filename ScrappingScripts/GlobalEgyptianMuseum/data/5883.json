{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "960", "Dating": "21ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI BOX", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Height": "34 cm", "Width": "30 cm", "Depth": "17 cm", "Name": "Shabti box", "Description": "This colourful painted box was intended for the storage of shabti figures or of other funerary gifts. Its shape imitates a silo with three vaults as its roof and highly raised side walls. The four sides are decorated with painted scenes. The front and back carry scenes of the adoration of Osiris by the tomb owner, one of the lateral sides depicts two of the sons of Horus, Hepi and Amset, and the other side has an image of the tree goddess who provides for the soul of the deceased. The soul is depicted as a bird with a human head and arms. Note the charming detail of the two grasshoppers in the tree. From the perspective of cultural history, it is interesting to note that the inscriptions on the box were obviously not understood by the painter."}
