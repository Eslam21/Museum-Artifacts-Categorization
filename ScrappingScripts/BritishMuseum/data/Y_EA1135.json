{"artifact_name": "naos", "Object Type": ["naos"], "Museum number": ["EA1135"], "Description": [" Limestone naos of Pasanesu: the naos contains a figure of Osiris, wearing the atef-crown, inside it and has a hawk on top. Texts are incised around the pedestal on which the naos sits and on the front of the naos consisting of prayers on behalf of the scribe of offerings of all the gods Pasanesu. The right side of the shrine bears a scene in sunk relief showing Pasanesu offering incense to Osiris, while a scene on the left side depicts him worshipping Ptah-Tatenen. A scene on the rear of the naos portrays Harsiese in the company of Isis and Nephthys. The top of the naos is also inscribed. A cartouche, apparently of Amenemhat III, on the top of the naos may relate to the worship of that king since it cannot be regarded as contemporary to his reign, being written with a sign which was commonly used instead of the 'n' sign from the New Kingdom. The naos is well preserved apart from several gouges, especially on the corners and left side. The bottom of the pedestal has been damaged and repaired in modern times.
