{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74707"], "Description": [" Portrait of a young man in encaustic on limewood: a vertical fissure runs through the panel from top to bottom, with slighter splits on either side. The painting is otherwise well preserved. The background is creamy grey. The youth wears a creamy-white tunic and mantle; a narrow mauve clavus appears on the proper right side of the tunic. The mantle is draped over both shoulders. The brush-strokes suggest thick folds of cloth, though the line of the tunic is visible on the proper right shoulder. The hair is very curly, with strands escaping from the edge of the coiffure. The beard is very short and trimmed square around the chin and cheekbones. The eyebrows are very long, as are the prominent upper lashes over the slanting brown eyes. The red lips are closed and turn down beneath a narrow moustache. The flesh is painted in warm honey tones with touches of pink and cream highlights on the nose and chin.

Egyptian funerary portraits in the Petrie Museum', Walnut Creek CA 2007, 61 ", " The style of the beard may be a sign of early (Flavian-Trajanic) date. The mouth and chin give the painting an unsatisfactory appearance, but this is more likely to represent a facial disability, in 1999 recognised as a hemiatrophy, rather than any inability on the part of the painter, who is in other respects competent.
