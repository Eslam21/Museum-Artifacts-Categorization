", " The sherd belongs to the same vase as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.129.1a, AN1896-1908-G.129.1b, AN1896-1908-G.129.1e and joins AN1896-1908-G.129.11. Cook states that the coarse execution of the decoration on this vase is very unusual in Clazomenian black figure. The fabric of AN1896-1908-G.129.1a was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the fabric found great similarities with the fabric from Wild Goat Style sherds found at Bayrakli in Asia Minor, which Dupont had attributed production to Clazomenae. Based on the similar composition types, Dupont then suggested that the place of production for this sherd ought to be situated near Clazomenae, Erythrae, or Teos (Boardman 1986, 664).
