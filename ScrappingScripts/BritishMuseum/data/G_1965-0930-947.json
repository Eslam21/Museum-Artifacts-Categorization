Reclining female limestone plaques are crudely carved rectangular limestone relief plaques of a reclining nude female figure, often with one or two small children, with a square-cut wig to the shoulders. They are often called \u2018concubines\u2019. Red and black painted decoration depicting jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets are also common on these. Many examples from Naukratis of this diverse group (Coulson 1996, 139-145, pl. XVII-4; Petrie 1886, 40, pl.19. 7-9; Hogarth 1899, pl.14.1-5; Hogarth et al. 1905, 127; see also comments by Gutch in Hogarth 1899, 82 nos. 49-56; Amsterdam 7948; Alexandria 16866, 16865, 16864; Cambridge E.191.1899, E.192a.1899; AN1896-1908-G.1008, AN1896-1908-G.1035, AN1896-1908-G.1034, AN1896-1908-G.1032, AN1896-1908-G.1031, AN1896-1908-G.1030, AN1896-1908-G.1029; Bolton 1966.88.A, 1966.89.A; British Museum EA 1886,0401.1506, 1886,0401.1506, 1886,0401.1504, 1886,0401.1510, 1886,0401.1511, 1888,0601.21, 1886,0401.1512; Cairo JE33574, JE33575; Heidelberg ST54; Coulson 1996, 142-3, pl.17.4, no.18, see nos. 19 and 21). This is specifically a variant with three dimensional rendering of the bed/couch and more detailed figures including individually carved feet (British Museum 1886,0401.1513; Oxford AN1896-1908-G.1028; AN1896-1908-G.1033; AN1896-1908-G.142), reminiscent of sympotic groups from Sais (Daressy 1901, 230-239; dated late 6th to early 5th century BC). Hogarth states these were common and popular in the sixth century BC (Hogarth 1905, 129, pl.19.4). Gutch regarded these (and terracotta copies) as offerings of women before or after childbirth, but dated them them late on the basis of being found near the surface (Gutch in Hogarth 1899, 82 nos. 49- 56, quoting Petrie 1886, 40). They were commonly found at Naukratis in the town (Petrie 1886, 22, 36, 40-1, pl.19.2, 7-9, Level 420 dated \u2018late 5th century BC\u2019; Hogarth et.al. 1899, pl.19.4). The majority of these types were found in, or adjacent to the Great Temenos area, the \u2018South site\u2019 (Hogarth 1903 box lists; Oxford, G.1035, G.1032, G.142, G1028) and east, but outside of the Great Temenos. (Griffith notebook January 1885; Oxford AN1896-1908-G.1031). Parallels from Memphis (Anthes 1959, pl.30, b.48, variant type 1.1c; Petrie Museum UC 8650-3; UC8648 dated 26th Dynasty), Kom Firin (Petrie 1884-5 notebook), Sais (Wilson pers. comm. see also Daressy 1901, 230-239) Hermopolis Magna (El-Ashmunein, Spencer 1989, 51, pl.80, 79, no.111; Spencer, Bailey and Davis 1984, 100, Figs 12.3 and 12.8) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC8649, UC8651, L-F.1.2 variants UC860, UC8653; see also UC8652). These figures originate from earlier Dynastic nude female on votive bed tradition, associated with the cults of Isis, Mut, Hathor and Anuket (Del Vesco 2009). These reclining female limestone plaques date from the late 7th to the 5th century BC. This three dimensional variant may represent a (later) late 6th to 5th century BC type. Anthes, R. 1959.
