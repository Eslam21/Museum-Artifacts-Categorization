XXXVIII, no. 78). Petrie illustrated variants of this association of an animal - often a falcon or a mythical creature - with a debased hieroglyphic inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 71-78). Such compositions are common on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B1-12, especially B5 for this piece). The hieroglyphs in the \"half cartouche\", as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93).
