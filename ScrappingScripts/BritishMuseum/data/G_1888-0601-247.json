Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 67, no. 825, pl.
