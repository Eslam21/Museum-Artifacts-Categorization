The front depicts the butchering of animals. It is probably one of three similar scenes of which only the middle one has been preserved intact. One front and both hind legs of the animals have been tied together with rope. The other front leg is stretched upwards being severed from the body by the butcher. Two other men are acting as assistants. The original paint on the relief is partly preserved: red-brown, red and blue. The relief may well come from one of the royal funerary temples at Abu Sir."}
