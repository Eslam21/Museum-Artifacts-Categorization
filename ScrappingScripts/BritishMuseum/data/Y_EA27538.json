Petrie interprets these small heads as two deities (illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XX, no. 3). This hybrid figure is characteristic of the Late Period; in better preserved parallels, the deity is represented naked, crowned, with multiple arms and wings and several pairs of animal heads framing his head, standing on crocodile and other dangerous animals: Andrews 1994, 38-39, fig. 34c; Herrmann et al. 2010, 74, no. 35 (Bes pantheos); Bianchi, Ziegler and Gandur 2014, 172-175, no. 46; Herrmann 2003, 101, pl. LXVIII, no. 493 (winged). Such figure had apotropaic properties against dangerous animals. According to mentions and representations in papyri, this composite deity is related to Amun-Ra and his hypostasis; this type of amulet suggests \"visually [the] universal omnipotence\" of Amun-Ra (Bianchi, Ziegler and Gandur 2014, 174; see also Herrmann et al. 2010, 74).
