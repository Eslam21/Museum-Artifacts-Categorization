{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA795"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Naya: a round-topped stela divided into three registers. All figures are in sunk relief and all texts are incised. In the upper register the first stable-master of the lord of the two lands and royal messenger to every land, Naya, is kneeling on the right in adoration of Osiris who is seated in the centre and behind whom stand Isis, Horus and Khnum. In front of Osiris lies an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. In the second register the stable-master Naya stands beside a heap of offerings and is pouring a libation and offering incense to six figures squatting on the ground: his father, the overseer of horses, P\u0292y, his mother, the lady of the house and chantress of Khnum, \u02bf\u0161\u0292t-nbw, his sister, the lady of the house and chantress of Khnum, Ty, his son, the w\u02bfb-priest of Khnum, P(\u0292)-n-T\u0292-wr(t), his sister, the chantress of Khnum, Wrt-nfrt, and his sister, the chantress of Khnum, B\u0292kt\u1ec9\u0292. In the third register Naya is shown making similar offerings before seven squatting individuals: his father (doubtless grandfather), the overseer of the cattle of Amun, N\u0292y\u0292, his sister, the lady of the house and chantress of Khnum, Wr(t)-nfrt (Naya the elder's wife and Naya the younger's grandmother), the chantress of Khnum, \u1e24ry, the chantress of Khnum, Nbt-wnw, his sister, the chantress of Khnum, \u0292st, the w\u02bfb-priest and temple-scribe of Khnum, P\u0292-sr and the porter of ... P\u0292-sr, whose title is obscure but may refer to some type of shrine or ritual object. The stela is in a good state of preservation. In places the text and figures have been carved directly over the imperfections in the stone with no attempt being made to smooth the surface. There are no traces of colour.
