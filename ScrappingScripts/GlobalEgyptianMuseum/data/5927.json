{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "A 1286", "Dating": "15TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TELL EL-DAB`A/AVARIS", "Category": "AXE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Name": "Battle-axe", "Description": "Characteristic of the weapons of the Hyksos are their bronze battle-axes. This type of weapon was not known in Egypt. The Egyptians used axes with a flat broad blade. The Hyksos battle-axe has a loop to fasten the handle to the axe. The loop was strengthened by ridges and at both ends are short thorn-like protuberances, which gave a better grip when binding the axe to the handle. The blade itself was long and slender. Such battle-axes are found in tombs, usually close to the head or chest of the deceased. "}
