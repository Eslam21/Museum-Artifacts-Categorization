Hogarth also mentions the find in his 1899 diary: 'In morning a little gold Bes [...] found by a woman who grumbled at 12 francs. However it kept work alive at N. end' (entry of Thursday March 2nd). He probably acquired it from a sebbakh-digger working in the area of the Hellenion. Another gold Bes amulet made with repouss\u00e9 technique is Brooklyn Museum 08.480.208, dated to the Late and Ptolemaic period.
