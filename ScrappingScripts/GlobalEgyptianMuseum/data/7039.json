The upper section, which at 7,5 cm is widest, was used to hold the object. Two fingers would have passed under each of the projections in order to enclose the entire object in the palm of the hand (note the polish of the stone caused by the friction of the grip). The lower section of the object has a sharp cutting edge, 4,9 cm in length. The cutting edge is smooth: certainly natural wear as a result of the use of the instrument."}
