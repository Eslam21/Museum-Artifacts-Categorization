{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 31301", "Dating": "AMENEMHAT III/NIMAATRE", "Archaeological Site": "HAWWARA", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "157 cm", "Name": "Seated Statue of Amenemhat the Third", "Description": "The limestone statue of Amenemhat the Third seated on his throne was found in the funerary temple of the pharaoh at Hawara. The sculpture was supposed to decorate the large building, which was probably built to celebrate the Sed festival. The sculpture of Amenemhat lacks the appearance of vigor and muscular strength found in other statues of the king. His physique is less robust. However, the idealized lines of his face give life to a portrait of a man with absolute steadiness. His gaze is fixed and severe, and his body has been shaped with rigid forms. The pharaoh sits with his hands resting on a striped kilt. His throne is similar to statues of Senusert the First found at Lisht. The sides of the throne are decorated in the same manner with the Sema-Tawy sign that symbolizes the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Two standing images of the Nile god Hapi flank the papyrus and a lotus plant, symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt."}
