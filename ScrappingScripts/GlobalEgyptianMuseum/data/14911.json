Sen-Thoth, son of the deceased, stands before his father carrying a libation vase in his right hand and a geese in his left. He wears a curled wig and a collar. He is dressed in two kilts; a short one of thick linen with a long, transparent one over it. The father sits on an elegant chair, the feet of which are modeled like the feet of an animal. Between them is an offering table laden with tall jars on stands.The offering text, in three horizontal lines, runs from left to right. It reads as follows: \"May the king give an offering and may Osiris, lord of Busiris, the great god, lord of Abydos, give an invocation offering consisting of bread, beer, calf meat, fowl and all good and pure things, on which the god lives there, (which are actually) given by heaven, created on earth, brought by Hapy (the Nile God) as his beautiful offerings, to the Ka (guardian Spirit) of Sheri, (dedicated) by his son who makes his name alive\"."}
