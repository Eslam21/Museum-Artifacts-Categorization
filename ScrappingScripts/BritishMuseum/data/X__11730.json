Head fragment of a woman wearing a high decorated head-dress of the kalathos type worn over her long hair. Possibly a representation of a goddess. Her hair is worn up into a point at the front in Classical Greek style. The face is naturalistic, though the eyes are almond shaped and heavy lidded. Mould-made and hollow or open backed. Traces of a white residue, probably from a white coating preparation for paint, possibly traces of red paint. Cypriot yellow-buff marl clay with abundant black or dark grey(volcanic?), red and white (limestone) inclusions. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Cypro-Classical II (?)

Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers.
