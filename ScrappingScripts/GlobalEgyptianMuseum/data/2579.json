{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1913:287", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "EL-RIQQEH", "Category": "INLAY", "Material": "CALCITE/ALABASTER; OBSIDIAN ?", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Name": "Pair of eye inlays", "Description": "Pair of eye inlays from a Middle Kingdom coffin, the whites of calcite, the pupils of a deep black stone, perhaps the semi-precious imported obsidian. The tomb from which they derive was not published by the excavators, perhaps because it was robbed, and it is not clear whether the eyes derive from the precise place they were found, or from a nearby burial, robbed in remote antiquity. The cemetery where they were excavated lies near the villages of el-Riqqeh and Girza, not far from the Residence of the Middle Kingdom kings at Itjtawy (probably modern el-Lisht)."}
