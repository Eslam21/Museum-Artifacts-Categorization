This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Marked '4' in pencil, a reference to the number of the object in the EEF distribution list. ", " This New Year\u2019s flask is recorded on the EEF distribution list for Boston as an 'aryballos, nearly complete, with necklace' from Naukratis. Much better preserved than any other specimens recovered from the site, it is also made in a different paste, whitish in colour. It does not seem to have been produced locally, unlike the ' \u201cpilgrim-bottles\u201d of fine yellow paste\u2019 that Petrie mentioned in his publication (Petrie 1886, 37). New Year\u2019s flasks are very common during the 26th dynasty. When cartouches are incised on the body of the flasks, they always refers to pharaohs of the 26th dynasty, especially Apries and Amasis, or to the Divine Votaress Ankhnesneferibre (God\u2019s wife of Amun from around 586 to 525 BC) (Caubet and Pierrat-Bonnefois 2005, 148-151, no. 398). Specimens discovered outside of Egypt seem to originate from 7th-6th century contexts (Caubet and Pierrat-Bonnefois 2005, 151). However, recent excavations provided a few examples from later contexts. They are attested in late 26th-early 27th dynasty contexts (Masson 2007, 614, pl. XXVII) and in Persian contexts at \u2018Ayn Manawir in the Oasis of Dakhla (Wuttmann et al. 1996, 429- 430). These flasks, offered as a gift for the New Year, were possibly meant to contain the water of the Nile as it rose at the beginning of the flood season.
