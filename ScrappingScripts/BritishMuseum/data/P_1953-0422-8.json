This example was probably acquired by the Museum in the 19th century, and although it once had the 'Old Collection' number 270 it is not possible to give a more precise date of acquisition (information from John Taylor, Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan, January 2003 ). Though usually a studio practice Legros did execute metalpoint drawings in front of the motif, particularly when copying from Old Master paintings in museums and art galleries (information from Timothy Wilcox 2002)."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 2015 10 Sep-6 Dec, London, British Museum, 'Drawing in Silver and Gold' "], "Subjects": ["museum/gallery"], "Associated names": ["Associated with: The British Museum"], "Associated places": [" Associated with: Tell Basta (Bubastis) "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Guy J F Knowles"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Charles Julius Knowles (Knowles Collection No.25)"], "Acquisition date": ["1953"], "Acquisition notes": ["1953,0422.1 to 14 are all by Alphonse Legros, and all come from the collection of the donor's father, C.J.Knowles (d.1900), who was a friend of the artist."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1953,0422.8"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 16 Mar 2015"]}
