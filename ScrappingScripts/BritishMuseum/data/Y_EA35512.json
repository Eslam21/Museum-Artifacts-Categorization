See also 1901,1012.11. The recess was not intended for the palette to fit within the cover, as the mudstone palette found with this object does not do so (1901,1012.11). Probably the recess was made to allow some cosmetic to be kept on the palette when the cover was in place. For similar objects, see W. M. F.
