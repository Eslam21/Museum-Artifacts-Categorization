The rear shows one side with two coils of basketry and anotherside with one coil of basketry. Both sides show traces of secondaryfire impact. The front bears a large oval scarab-like seal-impression with a fingerprint on top distorting the motif. A circumferential line is visible around a standing bull, facing to the left, positioned in the upper part of the seal. To the left of it what looks like a seated Horus, facing to the left. A third sign was positioned under the bull, behind the falcon but is not further recognisable.
