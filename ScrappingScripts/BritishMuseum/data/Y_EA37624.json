{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37624"], "Description": [" A forepart fragment of a hollow terracotta caparisoned racehorse, probably the lead-horse of a circus team, modelled in the round, the neck, head and chest remaining, and the upper part of the front left leg. The bridle and breastband are well indicated, and circular horse-brasses depend from the latter. The mane is wavy on both sides of the neck and also on top of the head, where it partially covers a triple wreath that rises from the forehead and which is drawn back in a multiple queue that is slightly damaged at the rear. The animal is modelled on both sides. Two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with a thick dark-grey core.
