Petrie's drawing indicates that the inscription displayed on this scarab was reproduced on several scarabs in glazed composition and Egyptian blue produced in the 'Scarab Factory' (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 90; on the various productions of the 'Scarab Factory', see Webb forthcoming). Numerous variants of the name of Amun-Ra were discovered on scarabs and scaraboids in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. 18, 25 and 36), without including all the different cryptographic writings of Amun on Naukratis scarabs and scaraboids. This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B97-117, see especially B97 for this piece).
