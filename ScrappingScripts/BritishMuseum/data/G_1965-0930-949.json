Fragments of ithyphallic limestone riders are rare at Naukratis (British Museum GR1965,0930.949 and possibly 1965,0930.952). They belong to a rare type known from Block 3 of the southern dependencies of the temple complex by the sacred animal necropolis at North Saqq\u00e2ra (Martin 1981, nos.303, 304) dating to the 30th Dynasty or the 4th century BC. They appear to represent Harpocrates (like terracotta types Thomas M-R.1, see British Museum GR 1973,0501.58, and stone figure type L-R.1, see British Museum EA 1886,0401.1486), though this is not certain, and possibly relates to other more ornate fragments of a youth on horseback in limestone found at Naukratis (Ashmolean AN1896-1908-G.1027; British Museum GR1886,0401.1493). Earlier (?) limestone horsemen figures dated between c.600 and c. 350 BC (with the majority likely coming from 27th Dynasty contexts) are common at Naukratis (Heidelberg, Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t, ST48; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1850; Cairo, Egyptian Museum JE36257, JE33573.2; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, AN1896-1908-G.1013, AN1896-1908-G.1007, AN1896-1908-G.109, AN1896-1908-G.1041, AN1896-1908-G.1040, AN1896-1908-G.1039, Bolton Museum 1966.90.A; British Museum 1886,0401.1486, 1886,0401.1487, 1886, 0401.1766; Cambridge MCA NA306, see also variants: Oxford, Ashmolean MuseumAN1896- 1908-G.1027; British Museum 1886,0401.1493, 1965,0930.952, 1965,0930.949) with parallels known from Buto (Cairo Museum TR14/ 1/34/8), Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888, 71, dated 7th century BC; Edgar in Hogarth 1905, 129, dated 6th century BC), Saqqara (Quibbel 1907, 13), and Sais (Wilson pers. comm) and can be dated Martin, G.
