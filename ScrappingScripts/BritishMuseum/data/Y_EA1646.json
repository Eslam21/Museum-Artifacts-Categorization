{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1646"], "Description": [" Quartzite statue of Nakhtherheb: Nakhtherheb is shown kneeling in reverence before Osiris, from whom he seeks benefits, his head slightly raised and his hands lying flat on his thighs. His unadorned headdress and short, plain kilt enhance the viewer's impression of deliberate simplicity and a kind of monumental tranquility. In Nakhtherheb's face and body, however, there is a considerable amount of modeled detail. His almond-shaped eyes and the high-set, horizontal line of his eyebrows, as well as the sickle-shaped curve of his slight smile, follow the pattern for facial features set early in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. But this face is broad and full, consonant with the body, which, though not fat, looks soft and fleshy. Nakhtherheb's torso is designed as three sets of swelling curves placed one below the other and comprising the breast, the rib cage, and the abdomen. The large round navel is set within a bulge shaped rather like a teardrop. The plinth is inscribed with a horizontal register of hieroglyphs and the dorsal pillar with two vertical registers of hieroglyphs.
