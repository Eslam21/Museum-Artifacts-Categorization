{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7039", "Dating": "3RD DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS ?", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "QUARTZITE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "8.3 cm", "Width": "6.8 cm", "Depth": "8.7 cm", "Name": "Divine head", "Description": "This statuette fragment, probably dating to the 3rd Dynasty, represents an anthropomorphic deity. All that remains of it are a roundish wig and the beginning of a curved back support. There is a parallel to this statuette in the Brooklyn Museum, which has the same wig but also a face with a false beard, and it is certain that both pieces were produced in the same Memphite workshop. Both formed part of a series of local nome deities intended to be placed in chapels located in royal funerary complexes, there to receive offerings made by the king."}
