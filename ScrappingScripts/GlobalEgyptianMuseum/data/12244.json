The arms, without sleeves, seem to be crossed left over right but this is difficult to tell. Both hands hold hoes. The modelling of the face is crude, the ears are relatively too big. The buttocks are placed disproportionally high. The statuette is provided with a peg under the feet for placing it on a pedestal. On the front, on the legs, the cartouche of Psusennes I is incised."}
