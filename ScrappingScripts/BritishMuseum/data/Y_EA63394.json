{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA63394"], "Description": [" Portrait of a woman in tempera on wood: the panel is broken at the right side, with much loss of paint in the lower right corner, along the lower edge and in the flesh areas. The upper corners are clipped. The subject is a woman dressed in a pink tunic painted with madder, an organic pigment applied with gypsum. The black clavi extend to the edge of the garment, but the painting is so crude and damaged that it is difficult to see whether a mantle was also shown. In her ears are triangular hoop earrings with suspended elements; only the pink outlines are preserved. Around her neck the woman wears a bead necklace and, beneath, a gold chain with a central stone or medallion. The black hair, painted in carbon-based pigment, is drawn back in rolls from the face and wound into a plaited bun on the crown of the head. The large eyes are simply drawn in black, with no pupil and roughly sketched upper lashes. The nose is much damaged; its pillar-shaped outline is drawn in orange, with dark red nostrils. The lips are typical of paintings from er-Rubayat, with a line drawn through them in darker tone. The flesh was originally ivory, with pink cheeks.
