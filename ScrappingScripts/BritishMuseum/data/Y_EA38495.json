{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA38495"], "Description": [" A pilgrim-flask. On each side, within a chevron-border, Saint Menas stands to front, his arms outstretched in blessing. Beside his head in relief lettering is an inscription. He has a nimbus, wears a short tunic with sleeves and a long cloak, and is flanked by camels. The two moulds used appear to be from the same archetype, but one was much more worn than the other; the applied neck, mouth and both handles are missing. Buff fabric, containing both dark and light sand.
