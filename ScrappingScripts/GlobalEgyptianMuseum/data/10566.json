On the basis of their posture and facial expressions they have been identified as actors. The right figure is male and the left figure is female because of the indication of breasts. Both wear short-sleeved chitons girded around the hips, hanging down to above the knees. Another interpretation of this group statuette identifies the figures as a pair of beggars."}
