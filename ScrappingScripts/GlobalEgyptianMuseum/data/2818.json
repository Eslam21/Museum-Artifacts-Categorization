{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:143", "Dating": "27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "STELA ?", "Material": "LIMESTONE ?", "Technique": "CARVED", "Depth": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a cuneiform inscription", "Description": "Fragment of limestone, bearing traces of three horizontal lines of inscription in the cuneiform script used in Western Asia. Although only one sign seems preserved intact, the scale of this suggests that it comes from a monument of some size. If it indeed comes from Egypt, it is a rare example of the use of cuneiform there. The most famous example of such usage is the Canal Inscription of the Persian King Darius, recording the decree for the cutting of a canal from the Nile to the Bitter Lakes and Red Sea. This fragment perhaps also dates to the period of Persian rule over Egypt, in the late sixth and fifth century BC. It may belong to the same inscription as L1030:144."}
