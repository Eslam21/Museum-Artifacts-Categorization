Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Naukratis Painter. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. Williams suggests that the sherd is a piece by the Aphaia Painter and compares the scene on the sherd with those on British Museum 1888, 0601.493.i, London UCL 383 and another from Aegina (Williams 1983 157- 160 figs.1-2)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
