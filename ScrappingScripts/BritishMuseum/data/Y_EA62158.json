{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA62158"], "Description": [" Four copper beads in the form of rings: one is described by the excavators as 'of thin metal ribbon wound up spirally to form a ring'; the shape is Brunton's 86W3. The three others are quite different: 'a thick strip of copper, rectangular in section, was bent round in a flat circle till the ends touched, thus forming a ring.' The first method is the usual one of Predynastic times; the second is apparently new.
