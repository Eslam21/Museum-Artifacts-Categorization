{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1982,0406.8"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Priapos. A bearded and draped Priapos standing, flanked by date-palms, with his head inclined to his right, pulling back his garment with his left hand to expose the hole where his separately made phallus was inserted (its stump remains together with its plaster adhesive). His right arm is contained within the drapery, the hand resting on his chest. He wears a dry measure with a disc or stud on the front, and boots. Only the upper part of a plinth survives. Behind his neck is a suspension-lug, but otherwise the back is plain. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with minute traces of a white dressing on the front.
