These cups are both the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes' Ionian Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). These cups were common drinking vessels, not just in the Greek sanctuaries at Naukratis, but elsewhere as well, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. The number in Petrie 1886, 143, is written in ink on the exterior surface of the sherd."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis. Part I., 1884-85 (pl.
