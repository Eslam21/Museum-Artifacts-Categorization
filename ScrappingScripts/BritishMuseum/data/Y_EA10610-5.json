{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10610,5"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum B (the Dramatic Papyrus)"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum B, Frame 5. Papyrus written on the recto in linear hieroglyphic script, containing the text of a liturgy in honour of Senwosret I (the so-called Ramesseum Dramatic Papyrus), illustrated with vignettes. The text is written in vertical columns with titles and some text in horizontal lines, possibly in retrograde script. This frame contains lines 108-138 on the recto and the plan of a building on the verso. The papyrus was a full-height roll. A rough plan is drawn on the verso of the papyrus, but the nature of the building depicted is not clear. 'The small chamber below to the left might be a porter's lodge, while the three circles to the right suggest bins. The hieratic legends are too faint and too incomplete to be read, but the word in the long corridor to the left must be attached either to the stem smA \"to slaughter\" or to sAm \"to burn\"' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 18). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
