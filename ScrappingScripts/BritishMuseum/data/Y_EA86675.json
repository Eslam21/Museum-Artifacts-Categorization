{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86675"], "Description": [" Quite tall seal-impression of clay, showing two smaller rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side one further but slightly larger coil, meaning that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket as EA86673 and EA86674. In the second coil an impression of a small square in which the lines are perpendicular to the basketry fibres, maybe this is a repair at the basket. The same can be found at EA86692. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles. The top part shows two impressions of a scarab-like seal close to each other, many finger prints around the seal impressions. The seal impressions show the same motif as EA86674 with a bird in the middle, facing to the left, in front of it two hieroglyphs (maybe nfr or nTr) on top of two small and flat signs like Gardiner N19. Behind the bird probably an uraeus. EA86674 also has the same impressions of basketry on the rear. The clay was hardened after excavation.
