Later in the first century BC the mint seems to have switched to the depiction of living Ptolemaic monarchs rather than dead Seleucid ones on the obverse of the silver. Quite why Ascalon should have been placing the portraits of Ptolemaic monarchs on its coinage in 64/63 and 50/49 BC is not immediately clear, since the city was not within the Ptolemaic realm at this point. It has been suggested that the issue of 50/49 BC was produced by the city to aid the campaign of the young Cleopatra during her period of exile at this time, before her restoration by Julius Caesar."], "Bibliographic references": [" BMC Greek (Palestine) / Catalogue of the Greek coins of Palestine (Galilee, Samaria and Judaea) (20, p.108) ", " Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth (219) ", " SNG ANS / Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum: The Collection of the American Numismatic Society (648-652) (cf.)
