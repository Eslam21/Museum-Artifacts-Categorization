{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1978.291.452", "Dating": "UNKNOWN", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS OF HUMANS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Width": "41 cm", "Depth": "27 cm", "Name": "Coffin", "Description": "A small wooden coffin, crudely fashioned and probably that of a child. The stucco on the surface is badly deteriorated. Separate pieces of wood have been added to the basic shape to form the wig lappets and face, which still bear faint traces of paint. On the sides the faint outline of figures remain, and as they appear to be mummiform it is possible that they represent the four Sons of Horus. There is no interior decoration and the planks are held together with many wooden dowels."}
