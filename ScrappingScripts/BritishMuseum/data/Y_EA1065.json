Now as the big column is destined for the British Museum, we have thought that a smaller monolith with palm leaf column capital which we found & which is in good condition, might be removed to be send (sic) to Boston. Mr Naville has to-day written about it to London & arranged that I shall get an answer by telegraph. \u2019 Extract from a letter from Count d\u2019Hulst to Amelia Edwards Cairo, Apr 22 1888 (EES Archive III.k.105) Count d'Hulst was employed by Naville to remove monuments from the temple area and transport them to Cairo.

It occurs to me that we could manage that because Mr. Gr\u00e9baut provisionally asked last year for the fine pillar we found to place it in the Gardens of Gezirah Palace in case the Boolak Museum should be transferred to there. Now that this project has been abandoned or at least postponed at (sic) infinitum I think one might obtain permission to remove it elsewhere.\u2019 "], "Location": ["On display (G4/B3)"], "Condition": ["good"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Ramses II ", " Named in inscription: Osorkon II "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1889"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA1065"], "Registration number": ["1889,0413.3"]}
