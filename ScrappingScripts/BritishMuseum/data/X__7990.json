", " Ball-shaped weights with a flat base are very close to the dome-shaped ones and form the same category of weights for Cour-Marty (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 5). Often made out of igneous rock such as basalt and diorite \u2013 which is the case for this specimen, they do also occur in copper alloy. They are very common weights at Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII, \u201cdome\u201d type), and elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 13). Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 26). These weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples; however a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, p. 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654).
