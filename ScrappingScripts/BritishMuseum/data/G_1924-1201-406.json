According to Lemos, that sherd is from a Grand Style chalice, but she places 1924,1201.406 in the Mature Animal Style. The vertical dividing band decoration on both sherds is typical of the Wild Goat Style and is no longer observed in the Mature Animal Style or Grand Styles; nor is the triple guilloche pattern typically seen on Grand Style vases, where decoration principally consists of human figures; and the pattern is not usually seen below the rim of vases in the Mature Animal Style. Such heavy decoration is most frequent on Wild Goat Style vases. The pendant roundel as filling ornament is not found in the Grand Style, but does appear in the Mature Animal Style, while interior decoration is not seen on Wild Goat Style vases, but appears in the Mature Animal Style. Perhaps this sherd marks a transition between the Wild Goat and Mature Animal Styles and so stands out for depicting human figures earlier than normal. Some Type A kantharoi, however, do have human figures, dividing bands and interior decoration. For other Type A kantharoi, see Williams 1983, 170-1, no. 57, fig. 12.
