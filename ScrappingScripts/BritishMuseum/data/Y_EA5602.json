This fragment from the tomb of Sety I in the Valley of the Kings comes from the king\u2019s titulary. The goose and a red sun-disc read \u2018Son of Ra\u2019, which generally preceded the king\u2019s nomen, or birth name. The text is painted on a yellow background and goose is painted blue-green with a red head, red and yellow back, and details of feathers in black. Below is a canal sign in green and blue, likely part of an epithet reading \u2018beloved of\u2019 a certain god. The text in the tomb of Seti I was written in vertical columns; the green band at the top indicates the top of the inscription, while the right hand side features a column dividing line and further hieroglyphs, one of them a mouth sign for the letter R.
