The top as well as the bottom is not preserved. The hieroglyphs are not very clear with other impressions on top of them and do not seem to make any sense. The upper side is flat while the underside is convex but quite uneven with several finger indents and impressions. This object might have been used as a stamp although the handling is not so easy without actual handle at the back.
