", " Bes on capital parallels are commonly dated 1st to 2nd century AD (Fischer 1994: no. 551, with other references to Bes on a capital), or Roman period (Frankfurter 1998: pl. 11 from the Fayum). Similar Bes figures have been found in Ptolemaic contexts, or dated to the Roman period (Bailey 2008: 38; Dunand 1990: 42-3, Cat. 42-45; Gutch in Hogarth 1898\u20139: 95n. 5). A similar example found at Naukratis (BM 1886,0401.1455), was previously considered to be late 6th century BC in date and made in Naukratis (Walters 1903: C 594; Higgins 1954: no. 1546). Though the fabric is consistent with Nile Delta kiln products, it is impossible to confirm a Naukratis origin for it. Parallels from Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos.3088-9, 3092, GR 1888,0601.95, GR 1886,0401.1455) and Cambridge MCA (NA684) probably all date from the late 4th century BC to 2nd century BC.
