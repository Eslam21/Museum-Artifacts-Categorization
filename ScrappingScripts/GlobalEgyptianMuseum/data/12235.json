An undetermined wing-like object is visible behind the left shoulder. He holds an oryx-gazelle in the right hand, and a lion plus two snakes in the left one. A dwarf with a necklace (in frontal view) stands beside him at the left side; a scorpion is depicted above the dwarf. Harpocrates stands on a ledge formed by two crocodiles, facing opposite sides. Underneath two more crocodiles are incised. The usual head of Bes is broken off, only the beard is still visible.The back has an inscription in eight lines; above is a row of gods: from left to right: a pathaikos (dwarf god), Amun-Re(?), an undetermined figure, Osiris, a pharaoh(?), Min, Horus, Thoth and some kind of animal. The inscription is continued on the bottom of the stela with three lines, and on both sides with one badly legible column each.The modelling is rather crude; the hieroglyphs are more evenly incised."}
