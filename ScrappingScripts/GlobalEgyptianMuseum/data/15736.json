{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 25132", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; PAINTED; DRAWING", "Width": "23 cm", "Name": "Wrestlers' Ostracon", "Description": "Two soldiers, perhaps Nubians, are shown grasping each other's necks in what is presumably a starting hold at the beginning of a match. At the side of the sketch a long hieroglyphic inscription reads, \"Behold, I will make you take a fall helpless, in front of the Pharaoh, may he live, be prosperous and healthy.\" It seems that the figures of the wrestlers were sketched on this ostracon and then corrected later in the final drawing."}
