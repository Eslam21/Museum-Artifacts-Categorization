Type 10 cups were mass produced and include numerous variants. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type V (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Numerous Type 10 South Ionian cups have been found at Naukratis, as well as in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra and at Megara Hyblaea on Sicily, and at Berezan on the Black Sea (Posamentir 2006, 165). The place of production of Type 10 South Ionian cups is determined as probably Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.1025) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 53, no. 361) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.190) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Made for: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.397"]}
