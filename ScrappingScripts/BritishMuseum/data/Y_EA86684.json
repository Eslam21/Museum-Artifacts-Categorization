{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86684"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, triangular in section. At the rear on each side one row of basketry coil. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica. The front shows one quite large impression of a scarab-like seal, the surface in this area bears little cracks. On the shallow seal impressions one long sign on the bottom right that seems to be a standing deity (Ptah?), facing to the left. Only two other signs visible in faint traces, above the deity could be an jmAx-sign (F39) and opposite somewhat further down a Hr-face (D2). Rest illegible.
