Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Sheet split into two sections by a double black line. Opening hymn to rising sun (Spell 15) plus vignette. Left-hand section is primarily made up of 20 lines of black and red cursive hieroglyphic text with black dividing lines. In the bottom left-hand corner beneath lines 12-20 (R-L) is a polychrome vignette of the deceased and his wife in adoration poses; framed by double black lines; black cursive hieroglyphic captions above both figures and to the right in front of them; main colours are white, pink, yellow, red and blue. Right-hand section contains full height polychrome vignette of Isis and Nephthys standing either side of a personified djed-pillar; above this a falcon with a sun-disk on its head (Ra-Horakhty) is flanked by seven baboons underneath a curved blue line possibly representing the sky. By most figures are black cursive hieroglyphic captions organised in single lines with black outer lines. Main colours are blue, green, white, black, red, pink and possibly yellow but it has faded. Framed by black lines. Composition fills sheet; framed by faded red and yellow line on all sides except right-hand side. Hardly any text/image loss except for yellow paint which has faded.
