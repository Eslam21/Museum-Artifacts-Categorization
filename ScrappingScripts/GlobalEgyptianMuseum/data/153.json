They appear from the middle of the 18th Dynasty, particularly during the reigns of Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten, and were produced until the end of the 20th Dynasty. The decorative motifs are limited to floral illustrations and lines with a preference for the blue lotus. The Brussels jar is a typical example of this blue ceramic. It comes from the excavations of Gurob at the beginning of the 20th century and probably dates from the 18th Dynasty."}
