{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA58077"], "Description": [" Fragmentary dark steatite male figure, the lower legs and base of the figure now lost. The figure is depicted in a standing position and wears a long kilt wrapped high on the abdomen and a shoulder-length wig which is tucked behind the oversized ears. The heavy clothing at the front of the figure curves outwards from the belly to the figure\u2019s calves. His elongated arms are held against the sides of the body with the palms placed flat against the clothing. His eyes are wide with a heavy upper eyelid, and a comparatively smaller and more crudely shaped nose and mouth. He has a clear upward gaze indicated by the sharply raised chin. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar inscribed with a single column of text, the lower portion of the inscription which included the subject's name is now missing. In addition to the loss of the lower legs and base, there are a number of scratches and cracks to the stone surface across the body of the figure. The nose has also been damaged though the outline of its shape is still intact, and there are small abrasions to the stone around the chest and arms, with damage to the left hand and forearm. The figure has been attached to a modern rectangular base.
