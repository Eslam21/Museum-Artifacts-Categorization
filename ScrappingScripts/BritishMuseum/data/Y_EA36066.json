It could be understood as a motto, a prophylactic inscription or it could be a way to write the name of Amun-Ra, with the sign j replaced by a Maat feather (Hall 1913, 206, no. 2051; see also on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). Similar cone seals were discovered on Punic sites such as Carthage (Gorton 1996, 48, fig. 8, no. 23-24, type XVB). According to Gorton, such scaraboids belongs to a Phoenician type of the 7th-6th centuries (Gorton 1996, 43, 48, type XVB). An almost identical conical seal was discovered in Naukratis (Gardner 1888, pl. XIX, no. 6). Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
