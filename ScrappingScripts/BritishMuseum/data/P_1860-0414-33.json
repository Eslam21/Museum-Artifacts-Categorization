This is the only etching Maella made and very few other impressions are known. Whereas is not possible to determine how many impressions were made, that so few are recorded suggests a very limited print run. Despite his fleeting engagement with printmaking, the composition and delicacy of the etching demonstrates his facility in this field. The print is technically close to those by artists who worked in his orbit including Ram\u00f3n Bayeu y Subias and Jos\u00e9 del Castillo suggesting the environment encouraged him to make this print. A preparatory drawing in red chalk for the print survives in the Royal Palace, Madrid (see J. de la Mano, 'Mariano Salvador Maella (1739-1819).
