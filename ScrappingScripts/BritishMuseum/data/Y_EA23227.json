{"artifact_name": "stamp", "Object Type": ["stamp"], "Museum number": ["EA23227"], "Description": [" A circular terracotta bread-stamp with an applied rectangular grip on the centre back. It has an incuse pattern: within a bound wreath, two erotes ride an elephant moving to right (in the impression). The elephant's back is covered with long drapery, on which the erotes perch. The front Eros sits astride the animal's neck, his upper body turned to front, and he plays a kithara; the other sits sideways on, also facing front; drapery or perhaps a single body-chain crosses from his left shoulder to his right hip. The elephant is tusked and raises its trunk. Pressed over a plaster form. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a lighter brown surface.
