{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1967.60", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED", "Name": "Mummy", "Description": "This mummy was in a badly damaged condition when the X-rays were carried out, the head was detached, the lower jaw missing, the feet missing and the wrappings were all gone. The body itself was a shapeless mass, heavy and covered in a layer of blackened resin. It seemed that the mummy had been subjected to considerable heat causing the resins to fuse, producing a solid casing around the body. The heart had been removed from the body and replaced by a collection of straw. Soft tissue turned to dust when touched and the bones themselves were brittle and easily broken. "}
