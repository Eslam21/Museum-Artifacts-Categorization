{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA14395"], "Description": [" Fragmentary green mudstone head of a male figure. He wears a smooth close-cropped wig that partly obscures the ears. His eyes are narrow and almond shaped, with sharply incised edges and a faint arched ridge above conveying the eyebrows. His nose is long and particularly broad at the tip, with a clear cupid\u2019s bow at his upper lip. The mouth is full with thick lips shown pursed together. His lower lip is sharply incised and the outer corners of the mouth are slightly upturned. On the reverse is an outline of the top of a back-pillar however the pillar itself has been gouged out. The tip of his nose has been damaged, and there are several discoloured marks on the right side of the face and wig. The figure is attached to a modern base.
