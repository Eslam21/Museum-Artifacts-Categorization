The dilute concentric lines on the interior surface suggest the sherd cannot be of his Type 9A. The concentric circles on the interior surface of the sherd find parallels with British Museum 1924,1201.1297 and 1965,0930.871. The sherd may belong to Schlotzhauer's Ionian Cup Type 9.C. This type (without the myrtle leaf pattern around the rim, which is missing in this instance) corresponds with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 49, no. 35) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.704) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.1291"]}
