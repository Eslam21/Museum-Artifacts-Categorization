{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA460"], "Description": [" Limestone seated female figure of Duat, part of a pair composition with her husband Mahu now broken into two pieces. Duat sits on the right side of the high-backed chair. She wears a long and heavy wig with detailed individual tresses and separated tighter braids of hair around the ends. Black paint has been applied to the wig. Her eyes are almond shaped with a thick upper eyelid and an incised line above indicating the eyelid crease. The arched eyebrows are indicated with faded black paint, and her nose is long and broad. The nose has a slightly bulbous tip. Her lips are thick and fleshy, and sharply incised along the edges. Her lips are pursed together with the outer corners of the mouth visible upturned. Her face is fleshy in appearance around the mouth and jawline, with traces of yellow paint applied to her face and body conveying the skin. Traces of red paint are also visible across her lips. She wears a long broad-collar across her chest, detailed with faded black paint. She also wears two striped bands across her upper arms. Her left arm extends out beside her, likely originally placed behind the image of her husband, while the right arm is held across the lap. On her right wrist is a bracelet detailed with faded red paint. She wears a long tight-fitting dress with visible traces of white paint across the clothing. A single column of text is inscribed across her lip and extending down to her ankles. A horizontal line of inscription is featured around the statue base, beginning at front and continuing around the right side of the seat. On this right side of the seat seven further columns of text are inscribed, and on the reverse of the chair six long columns of text are inscribed behind Duat. There are traces of blue paint in some of the hieroglyph signs, and red paint within the incised borders. There are several chips across the edges of the chair and front of the statue base, resulting in damage to some of the inscription.

The figure of Duat, arrived at the Museum two years before her husband\u2019s statue (also EA 460: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA460). The surviving inscription across the monument features various dedications to Theban deities, and their professions also suggest a link to the Theban area. Mahu is given the title \u2018overseer of the work of Amun at Karnak\u2019, while Duat is described as the \u2018priestess of Amun-Re and Hathor\u2019, thus it has been inferred that the statues originally came from Thebes. Such statues would have typically been established either in tomb or temple contexts, where the statue was likely intended to receive offerings for the afterlife. Further Bibliography: J. Assmann, M.
