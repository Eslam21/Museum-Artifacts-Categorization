Since the early Dynastic period, wooden sickles with flint blades attached with resin were placed in tombs for use in the hereafter. This marvelous model sickle of Tutankhamun is made of gilded wood and decorated with the cartouches of the king, bearing his birth and throne names. The serrated blades are made of colored glass. The sickle was probably used for ceremonies in which the king himself took part during Peret, the annual harvest feast. The deceased king also could use the sickle in the afterlife to harvest his crops or cut down any evil that might oppose him during his journey in the underworld."}
