{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1882:3118", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "5.8 cm", "Name": "Amulet of aegis of Sakhmet", "Description": "Votive or amuletic aegis, a form derived from the garlands around the head of a deity at the prow and stern of ceremonial boats. In this example the head of the deity above the semi-circle of garlands has been abraded, but enough survives to identify it as a lion-head. The lion was used in Egyptian religious iconography to depict goddesses such as Sakhmet embodying the fury of the sun-god, called 'eye of Re'. This aegis could come from a shrine to that goddess."}
