The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which bears the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure. However, none of these features are visible on British Museum 1924,1201.414. Whilst all that is visible of the female figure is her chiton, it is not depicted in outline. The interior decoration on the sherd, which is elaborate, is consistent with the Grand Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
