Above the boats are spikey zig-zag lines rather than the more usual wavy lines. The lower body is painted with two elongated Naqada plants and two elongated skin on pole motifs. The presence of Naqada II style motifs applied in white paint on this red polished jar was initially seen as evidence that the Naqada I and Naqada II cultures were separate entities that overlapped in time, and this generated much discussion, which can now be discounted as the decoration is now considered to be have been added in modern times to an authentic pot of Naqada I-early Naqada II date.
