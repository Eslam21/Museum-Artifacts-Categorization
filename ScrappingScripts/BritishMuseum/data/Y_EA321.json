In the upper register the ship's captain, Pata(?), kneels on the right in adoration of Osiris, Horus and Isis; before him is an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus blossom. In the second register the follower Harmin, the lady of the house Astniut, the stable-master Bakaa, the porter Ipy and the lady of the house Mery squat in a row before a pile of offerings on the right. The third section of the register consists of a prayer in two lines to Osiris and Anubis on behalf of Harmin. The edges of the stela are slightly damaged, and there are gouges on the surface. A nodule of rock remains in the left-hand lower corner. Traces of yellow can be seen on some of the figures.
