{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 31144", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "EL-LISHT", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "194 cm", "Name": "One of Ten Sitting Statues of Senusert the First", "Description": "Senusert the First seated on a solid cubic throne is one of ten similar white limestone statues found hidden near the funerary temple of Senusert the First at Lisht. The white limestone sculptures were carved to adorn the complex but were never placed in the temple, perhaps because of changed decoration plans. The whole stylized figure still demonstrates the artistic traditions of the Old Kingdom, with a rigid depiction of the figure's musculature that accentuates the pharaoh's impression of strength. The king has a serene expression on his well-proportioned and youthful face. He wears the Nemes headdress and a clinging kilt that is striped on some of the 10 statues. The uraeus, or royal cobra, on the forehead and the false beard are both symbols of royalty. The pharaoh's hands rest on his legs, one hand holding a kercief and the other palm downward. The solid throne is decorated on its sides with reliefs of the Sema-Tawy, sign of the unity of the two lands. These are flanked by two personifications of the Nile god and by the papyrus and lotus plants. The cartouche with the king's coronation name, \"Kheperkare,\" crowns the composition while other hieroglyphs bear the names and epithets of the gods portrayed.The double image of the Nile god seen on the thrones of five of the statues is replaced on the others by the portrayal of Horus and Seth and a cartouche with the king's birth name, \"Senusert.\""}
