The nose and the left ear are broken.The head was in the process of being carved. This is evident from the guideline that extended through the philtrum, or midline groove in the upper lip that runs from the top of the lip to the nose, and down the center of the lower lip. The parts that needed special attention were indicated by black brush marks. The sculptor had apparently copied this from the painted master portrait of Nefertiti. He made the mouth of the queen larger than usual."}
