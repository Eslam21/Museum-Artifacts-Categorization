{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1131"], "Description": [" Limestone block-statue of Inebny: the sculptor's clearly appreciated how the simple, broad planes of the cloaked form focused attention on the face; here, the effect has been dramatized by unusually sparing use of paint. The pose conveys humility, making it appropriate for a temple setting, and the shape offers large surfaces for inscription. Inebny's statue is striking for its use of colour, which draws attention to its two most important elements: the inscription, filled in with blue, and the head, on which the hair, eyes, and brows are painted black. The treatment of the eyes is particularly noteworthy because they appear as brown rather than the usual black. This effect was achieved by applying an initial layer of red paint that was then covered with black. The triangular shape of the face, with its wide-open eyes and arching brows, is typical of the period.

Inebny served as a troop commander and overseer of weaponry during the joint reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. He also had the title King's Son, which has led to the suggestion that he served as viceroy of Kush, but this cannot be verified. He certainly campaigned in Nubia, however, for his inscription states that he \"followed his lord\" on expeditions into the foreign lands both south and north of Egypt. The statue was dedicated to Inebny by both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, whose names appear in the first and second lines of the inscription. In the text, Hatshepsut's royal epithets are given feminine gender, \"the Good Goddess, Lady of the Two Lands, Maatkare,\" and Thutmose is called \"her brother, the Good God, Lord of Action, Menkheperre.\" As one would expect, at some later time the cartouche of Hatshepsut was erased by the agents of Thutmose III; however, the feminine epithets were left. The fact that the statue itself survives unharmed suggests that Inebny had done nothing to incur the wrath of Thutmose, unlike some of Hatshepsut's officials, whose monuments were destroyed.
