This unique model of a palette is made of schist. It is decorated with pieces of colored glass in simple geometric designs. The upper part contains the throne name of Tutankhamun, \"Neb,\" the basket; \"Kheperu,\" the scarab; three strokes; and \"Re,\" the sun disk. These are inlaid with colored glass and faience. Two Udjat eyes, symbols of protection and healing, are placed above the throne name. Beneath the name are two Djed pillars, the symbols of stability and endurance."}
