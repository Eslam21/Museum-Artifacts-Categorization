{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA8506"], "Description": [" Limestone ostracon: a sketch for a wall painting. It depicts a young woman sitting in a vine-covered bower nursing an infant. Her hair tied atop her head, she appears to be naked except for a cloak (or a sling to carry the child?), elaborate sandals, jewellery, and a belt. Her cushioned stool is distinctive in shape. The fragmentary servant figure below, whose earring and partly shaven hairstyle suggest that she is a Nubian, is proffering a mirror and a tubular container for kohl, complete with applicator stick. Since she is surrounded by the same vine leaves, it is probable that she is also in the pavilion, presenting these objects to the young mother, who, secluded in her bower, is tending to her newborn, regaining her strength, and perhaps undergoing purification.
