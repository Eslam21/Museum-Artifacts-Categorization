", " According to its findspot from the Museum's register, this scarab comes from the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see: Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). The inscription written on its base, however, is atypical among the scarabs from Naukratis, as it refers to a pharaoh of the 25th Dynasty, Shabaqo. The presence of this early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). A exact pendant to this scarab is published in Petrie 1889, pl. 59, no. 1877 (British Museum EA3920). Duck scaraboid presenting the same inscription: \u015aliwa 2015, 35-36, no. 27.
