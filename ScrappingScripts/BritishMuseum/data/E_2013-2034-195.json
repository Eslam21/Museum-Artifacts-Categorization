The handprint is quite faint and the outlines have been blown in brown pigment. To the left of the central hand print are two human figures painted in darker brown, upright and facing right, apparently running with arms and legs splayed. The right figure (woman?) has short appendages (breasts?) hanging from beneath the arms on either side and appears to be carrying something in the right hand. This object has a thin arc outline on one side and a bulbous, infilled object on the other (bow?). They are running toward three tiny human figures which superimpose the hand print and are pictured in a line, bent at the waist, upright and facing left toward the runners. To the lower right of these figures is the figure of a brown standing bird, upright and facing left. Cave of Swimmers, Egypt.

Wadi Sura (also spelled Sora) is a valley on the western edge of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s western desert. There, two shallow caves lie on the right at the entrance to the inlet, one smaller than the other and both containing rock paintings. Hans Rhotert designated the caves C and D. Cave C is the larger and contains the paintings of the famous \u2018swimming\u2019 figures inspiring those in \u2018The English patient\u2019. Cave D, which is close by, contains a single scene of cattle and archers. These caves were discovered, and the valley named, in 1933 by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy. There are several other rock art sites nearby, some discovered by Alm\u00e1sy and Rhotert in the same year, or by P. A. Clayton in 1931, and several which have subsequently been found and documented by Giancarlo Negro, Yves Gauthier, Werner Lenz, Andr\u00e1s Zboray, Werner Lenz and others."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " bird ", " arms/armour "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Cave of Swimmers "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.195"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWSU0010010 (TARA number) "]}
