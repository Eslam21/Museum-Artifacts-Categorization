The practice of mummifying large numbers of animals and birds began in the Late Period, around 700 BC. It is one of the most striking features of Egyptian religion in the Late Period and Ptolemaic to early Roman Periods, but it remains little understood. The falcon appears in Egyptian iconography as a means of depicting celestial power, above all for the sun-god Re, and the god of kingship Horus. Already at an early date the mummified falcon was also a symbol of the divine image in general."}
