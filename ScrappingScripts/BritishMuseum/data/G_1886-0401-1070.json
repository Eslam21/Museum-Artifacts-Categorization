Iconographically, it does not differ from its counterparts in the Sphinx and Lion style (both derive from Middle Wild Goat). Williams places the sherd within the Sphinx and Lion style based on the presence of bulls on other sherds in that style. The interior of vessels in the Sphinx and Lion Style are very rarely covered with a black slip. Furthermore, the bull is stylistically different from those found on Sphinx and Lion Style vases (see British Museum 1886,0401.1296; Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.97a.1894; Boston 88.957; Oxford AN1896-1908-G.120.5). The sherd might be more appropriately placed with other Black Figure Animal Chalices. At least one bull does appear on another Black Figure Animal chalice (see British Museum 1924,1201.340)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
