The rear shows a convex impression like from a vessel or similar object, in the break two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.15 cm. The front side is flat and covered by finger impressions, it shows most parts of a larger oval scarab-like seal-impression with a circumferential line. The lower part is covered with finger impressions. The upper part shows a standing figure of Amun, facing towards the left, wearing the double feather crown and a beard, both arms at the side of the body. Around the figure very small signs, in front an unidentified sign (seated goddess?), underneath possibly a wsr, in the lower part an ureaus. Behind the figure another unidentifiable sign visible in the upper part. The same motif as EA86808.
