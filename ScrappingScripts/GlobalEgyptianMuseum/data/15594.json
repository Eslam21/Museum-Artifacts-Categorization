{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63798", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING", "Height": "8.7 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of a Monkey Carrying a Net", "Description": "The drawing shows a seated, colored monkey holding a net bag. The monkey bends its right leg slightly to lift the back of the netting up a little bit. The top of the bag is very close to the monkey's mouth, and one might think the monkey has already started to eat from the bag. The artist has used cross-hatching effectively to indicate the monkey's fur. On the upper right-hand corner of the ostracon, a few hieroglyphic signs can be traced. These possibly read, \"Has done it for his lord.\" It seems that this drawing, in its full version, belongs among the socially critical comic drawings that were common during the Ramesside period when this sketch was made."}
