{"artifact_name": "model; axe", "Object Type": [" model ", " axe "], "Museum number": ["EA47790"], "Description": [" Iron model axe-head: made of sheet metal. It has a relatively squat blade with splayed sides and a slightly convex cutting edge. Instead of lugs there is a roughly cylindrical socket formed by hammering the butt round. Enclosed in the socket is a narrow metal rod, presumably the top section of the original haft. The blade is warped and lightly corroded. There are small cracks in the sides and on the socket. The cutting edge was shaped by light grinding but is not very sharp.
