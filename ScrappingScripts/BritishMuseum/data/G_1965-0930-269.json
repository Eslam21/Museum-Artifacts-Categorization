The size of the sherd suggests that it most likely comes from a heavy chalice, a shape that was introduced with the Mature Animal Style. The wall decoration of Mature Animal Style chalices is more restrained than that on Wild Goat Style chalices. Therefore, this vessel may belong to the transition from Wild Goat to Mature Animal Style.
