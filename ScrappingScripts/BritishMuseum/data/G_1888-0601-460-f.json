Although Lemos does not discuss this sherd, she does discuss two other sherds from the same vase: 1888,0601.459 she describes as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration (Lemos 1991, 72-3). 1888,0601.460. e she describes as part of the Group of the Aphrodite Bowl, rather than as by the painter of the bowl, because the sherd displays a greater amount of variety in the filling ornaments, albeit similar to those on the Aphrodite Bowl (Lemos 1991, 74-5).. However, the filling ornament on this dinos is not as expertly and evenly executed as that on the Aphrodite Bowl. ", " Although it is worn the ornament band at the top of the sherd does not appear to be the maeander of 1888,0601.460e; the sherd may therefore be from the other side of the pot.
