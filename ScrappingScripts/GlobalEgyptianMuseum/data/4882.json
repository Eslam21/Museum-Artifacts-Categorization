Merimose's wig is falling over his shoulders. He is wearing a broad collar and his arms are decorated with numerous armlets and bracelets. His right hand is flat on his thigh, and the left hand is clasping a towel. Despite the slight damage to the face, it conveys a lively and even individual expression.
