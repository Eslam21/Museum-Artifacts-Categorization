{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86691"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration An almost complete sealing is preserved with two rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and one at the side, showing that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica. The top part shows two impressions of a scarab-like seal and many finger prints around the seal impression. There are several cracks on the surface. The clay was hardened after excavation. The seal impressions are very shallow and show a circumferential band two or three figures at the shallow side. The figure on the right seems to sit on a throne, facing left, the figure on the left could be kneeling, facing right, in between them some sort of sceptre or an offering table. Above the figures a cartouche, illegible. Next to the cartouche a thickened line, maybe a winged sun disc? Same seal as used on EA86693, EA86705 and probably EA86713.
