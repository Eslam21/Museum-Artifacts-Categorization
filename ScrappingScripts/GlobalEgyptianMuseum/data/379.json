It was in the name of Neferirtenef, an important person who had fulfilled a series of administrative and judiciary functions under the first  reigns of the 5th Dynasty. His wife, Outheset-kaou, was of illustrious origin and bears the titles of \"prophetess of Hathor, mistress of the sycamore\" and of \"prophetess of Neith who is to the North of her wall\". The chapel, originally of rectangular form, comprises two false-door stelae of which the vertical uprights were decorated by reliefs figuring Neferirtenef and his wife. The other walls show offering scenes, scenes of provision supplies and scenes of agricultural work and of the hunt. Even if the chapel is in a reduced size, the scenes represented and the quality of work show the exceptional character of this funerary monument of the Old Kingdom."}
