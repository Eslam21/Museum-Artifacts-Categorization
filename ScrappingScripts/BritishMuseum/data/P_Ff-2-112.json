Bohn dates this to the early 1590s, a decade or so before the Windsor sheet. Loisel suggests that this drawing may have inspired the figure seen from the front in Annibale's 'Landscape with a fishing scene' of the late 1580s in the Louvre, Paris (D. Posner, 'Annibale Carracci :a study in the reform of Italian painting around 1590', New York, 1971, II, no. 44, pl. 44b). Lit.: H. Bodmer, 'Lodovico Carracci', Burg bei Magdeburg, 1939, no. 39; R.
