", " Bronze figures of Harpokrates were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods in Egypt (Weiss 2012, 126-157, Typ 41-69, Pl. 11-19), chiefly in the Delta where his cult was particularly developed (Sandri 2006). Likewise, the child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). This figure of Harpokrates belongs to the type 42 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 128-130, 573-576, Pl. 11c-e, see esp. Nr. 1545 for this specimen), a type that appears on a number of sites in the Delta, such as Saqqara, Herakleion-Thonis, Sais and Athribis (see for instance: Davies, Smith 2005, 121; Roeder 1956, 119-121, \u00a7170b, k-h, Pl. 17d and 18d).
