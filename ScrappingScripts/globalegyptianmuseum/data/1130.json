The scribe is holding a writing support on his knees. This was probably a  wooden board whitened with stucco, which could be wiped after each use. The text is limited to a summary of foodstuffs. Seeing that the majority of similar objects has been found in tombs, it is certain that the summary written by the scribe on the tablet must be interpreted as a verbal list of provisions meant for the dead."}
