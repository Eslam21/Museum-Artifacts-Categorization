Ring flasks in pottery and stone appear to be a short-lived variant of 'pilgrim flasks', appearing in the middle 18th Dynasty (reign of Tuthmose III, 1490-1436 BC) but going out of fashion before the Amarna period (1364-1347 BC). This flask is certainly of a later date, but no parallel from a securely dated context is known to me. The flask came from the excavations carried out at Abydos in 1925 by Henri Frankfort ('Journal of Egyptian Archaeology' 12 (1926), pp. 157-65; 'Journal of Egyptian Archaeology' 16 (1930), pp. 213-20). Grave 1200 was not published, but the records indicate that a string of beads was the only other object found in the burial. Bibliography: W. M. F.
