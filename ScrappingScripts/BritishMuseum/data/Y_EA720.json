{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA720"], "Description": [" Sandstone head of Mentuhotep II: This head comes from an Osiride statue, which represented the king with his royal headdress but with his body wrapped in a short white cloak. Beneath it, his arms were crossed over his breast, with only his hands exposed. Since the paint on this head is unusually well preserved, we can see that it followed the standard convention of showing the king's face a dark red, as on most representations of Egyptian men. His eyes and eyebrows were painted black and white. The white crown retains traces of white paint.
