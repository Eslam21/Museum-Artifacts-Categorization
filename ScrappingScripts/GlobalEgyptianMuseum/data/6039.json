This is a so-called Pataikos figure, who resembles Bes (prominent belly with short and twisted legs). His face, however, is that of a man with succinct but precise features. The ears of the figure were placed very low down, allowing for a hole to be pierced through the head and eventually to suspend the figurine on a string."}
