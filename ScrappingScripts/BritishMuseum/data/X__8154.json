", " Dome-shaped weights are very close to the cupcake-shaped ones; they just do not show a sharp edge, or strong carination. Such type, especially the one made out of basalt, is one of the most common weights found in Naukratis, and elsewhere in Egypt (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201csub-domed\u201d type; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 26). Dome-shaped weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples, like with this example; however a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; Gerritt van Alfen, P. 2002, 184, n. 654). The Egyptian standard kedet is nonetheless the most used standard in Naukratis (Petrie 1926, 14; Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 25). The original weight was ca. 185 g (loss of 5% about), so 2 debens.
