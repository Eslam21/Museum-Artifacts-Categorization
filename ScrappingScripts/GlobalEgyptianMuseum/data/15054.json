Most of them come from Lisht where the king and his predecessor Amenemhat the First built their pyramids, surrounded by the tombs of their relatives and most important dignitaries. Senusert is portrayed here in the traditional pose as a mummy with his arms folded across his chest. Unlike other Osiris colossi, or large statues, here the arms and hands are clearly distinct from the body. Senusert wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. His squarish face, painted in light red, has strong features. The large almond-shaped eyes with well-defined lids are below thick eyebrows in low relief. The nose is wide at the base and the rather large mouth has fleshy lips. The pupils and eyebrows are painted black."}
