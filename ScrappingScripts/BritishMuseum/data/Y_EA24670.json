This extraordinary set of moulded green glazed composition game pieces (seven jackals and ten Bes-headed figures) almost certainly accompanied an elaborate board, now lost, for the funerary 'senet' game. In this context, the Bes image, which might normally suggest the visage of the dwarfish divine protector of the household, probably recalls the group of mysterious underworld deities known collectively as 'Ahau', the \"fighters\", who were seen as the enemies of all supernatural miscreants and all those inimical to the sun god in the netherworld. As game pieces they would probably have been thought efficacious in defending the \"deceased\" player in his simulated journey with the sun god through the realms of night on the senet board.
