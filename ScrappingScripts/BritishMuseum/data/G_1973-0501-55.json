{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.55"], "Description": [" Terracotta female figure. Naked pregnant woman, squatting with legs raised on each side to expose her genitals: she holds her left leg up with her left hand, but both her left arm and her lower leg are lost; she indicates her pubic area with her right hand. She looks down to her right; her hair has a centre parting, and she wears bracelets and armlets on her right arm. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with traces of a white dressing; there are minute touches remaining of pink-buff paint on the flesh and dark-red paint on the hair.

Naukratis is the most likely find spot and production place for these objects, based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% are from Naukratis). Similar parallels dated from the second century BC to first century AD, from Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.104.1914; = Ashton et al. 2004: no. 92). The Hellenistic period is also suggested (Montserrat 1996, pl. 23; and Dunand 1990, no. 562; and Grmek and Gourevitch 1998, 167, fig. 115). Petrie Museum UC33447, from Memphis; and parallels from a Ptolemaic context at Akoris (Tsujimura 1999, 16, fig. 12:6). Also a very similar Hellenistic terracotta from the Cyrenaica, regarded as based upon Egyptian examples (Burn and Higgins 2001, no. 2777). Ashton, S.-A., Buttrey, T. and Popescu, A. 2004.
