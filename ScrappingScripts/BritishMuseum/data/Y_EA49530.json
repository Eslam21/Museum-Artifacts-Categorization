The details are rather clearer, and the back has an incuse palm branch from top to bottom rather than a series of lines. The circles in the V of the necklace are in relief and not incuse. A large part of the lower body is lost. Two-piece mould. Pink Aswan kaolinite clay, covered with an overall yellow-white slip. Details of decoration - the face, hair and wreath, breasts, clothing and jewellery - are picked out in black fired-on ceramic colour, with touches of orange.
