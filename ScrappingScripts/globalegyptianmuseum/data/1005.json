The upper part, which was probably of falcon-headed form, is not preserved. The coffin and the mummy have their place in the context of the \"Mysteries of Osiris\" during the month Khoiak. After having \"fabricated\" a mummy of barley grains, the priests of the cult of Osiris sprinkled it with water over nine days. The germination was the symbol of the rebirth of Osiris and at the same time of all nature.  The rite coming to an end, the mummy was laid down in a coffin which was then interred in the necropolis. The coffin, which is difficult to date precisely, was painted in black."}
