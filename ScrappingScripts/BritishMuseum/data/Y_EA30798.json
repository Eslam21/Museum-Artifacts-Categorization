{"artifact_name": "gaming-piece", "Object Type": ["gaming-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA30798"], "Description": [" Forty-nine marbles: mostly spherical, but including a few which are pear-shaped. The marbles are made of various materials, the number of each being: porphyry 15, limestone 21, breccia 4, quartz 9. Five of the quartz marbles have three white veins running through the stone, which has been deliberately cut so that the veins are in the centre of the marble, no doubt as a decorative effect.

R. Ayrton & W. L. S. Loat, 'Pre-dynastic cemetery at El Mahasna' (London, 1911), pl.XVIII, 1'. The British Museum marbles are said to have been found together with the stone bowl, also numbered 30798 (28). This form of vessel is undoubtedly to be dated to the First Dynasty, and most probably to the earlier part of that period. For similar Early Dynastic marbles, see W. M. F.
