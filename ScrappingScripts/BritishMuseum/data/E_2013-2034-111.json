{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.111"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of engraved rock art on a limestone cave wall showing an unidentified quadruped animal figure, upright and facing right. The figure is outlined and infilled with multiple flowing, sketchy incisions and the neck and forequarters appear to have been slightly rubbed. The animal has an upright, arched neck but the trunk and hindquarters devolve into multiple parallel incisions which meet in a diagonal cross-hatched pattern. The engraving is somewhat blended with multiple natural, close, vertical drip marks covering the rock surface, two of which suggest ears at the top of the engraved head. To the bottom left of the image are two toepads of an engraved, pecked, infilled and polished lion pugmark. A 10cm photo scale has been fitted at the bottom of the image. Wadi el-Obeiyd, Egypt.

This limestone cave site is a series of connected caves above the Wadi el-Obeiyd (also spelled el-Obeiyid), north of the Farafra Oasis, in Egypt. The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave has an entrance about 2.5m wide and 2m high with a flat natural lintel which makes it look from a distance as if it is man-made. The cave opens inside with a curved back wall and domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with circular rear wall. Both domed ceilings are smooth except for remains of old wasp nests forming small rough protuberances. The walls are scored by numerous parallel vertical striations and there are stalagmites near the cave entrance. These engravings are on the back wall of the first chamber. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " mammal ", " wild cat/big cat "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.111"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010018 (TARA number) "]}
