{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:134", "Dating": "MODERN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "PAPYRUS", "Material": "PAPYRUS", "Technique": "CARVED; WOVEN", "Name": "Fake papyrus roll", "Description": "Roll made from ancient Egyptian or Coptic papyrus fragments, stuck together in the last century and bound with strips torn from mummy-wrappings, to give the whole the appearance of a papyrus roll. By the 1830s, finds of intact papyrus rolls were scarce, even in Thebes, and the unwary traveller was more likely to be offered such a fabricated roll. The fragments from these rolls can now be detached and pieced together, to reveal the original document. On this example a Coptic papyrus fragment is visible, whereas the seal impression is from a New Kingdom scarab."}
