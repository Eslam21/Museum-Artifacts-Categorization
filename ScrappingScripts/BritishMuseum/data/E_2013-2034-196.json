{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.196"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on a sandstone cave wall, showing the painted, infilled figures of two human figures and six unidentified shapes. The human figures are of commensurate size and infilled in brown. The central figure is upright and facing right, with handless arms outstretched and legs swept back in a fluid sense suggesting movement. The other human figure lies above this, turned to the side and facing down with the head to the right and body curving down at the waist, with straight, slightly splayed legs. To the left of these figures is the very faded remains of some lighter pigment, now a pale green, suggesting an upright teardrop shape, now almost all disappeared by leaving an outline of an oval turned to the side at the base. From the bottom of this oval protrude two brown, infilled, downward facing points next to each other (legs?) and another resembling a lower leg and foot sticks from the upper left of the oval. A 5cm photo scale has been fitted at the base of the image. Cave of Swimmers, Egypt.

Wadi Sura (also spelled Sora) is a valley on the western edge of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s western desert. There, two shallow caves lie on the right at the entrance to the inlet, one smaller than the other and both containing rock paintings. Hans Rhotert designated the caves C and D. Cave C is the larger and contains the paintings of the famous \u2018swimming\u2019 figures inspiring those in \u2018The English patient\u2019. Cave D, which is close by, contains a single scene of cattle and archers. These caves were discovered, and the valley named, in 1933 by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy. There are several other rock art sites nearby, some discovered by Alm\u00e1sy and Rhotert in the same year, or by P. A. Clayton in 1931, and several which have subsequently been found and documented by Giancarlo Negro, Yves Gauthier, Werner Lenz, Andr\u00e1s Zboray, Werner Lenz and others."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["painted rock art"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Cave of Swimmers "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.196"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWSU0010011 (TARA number) "]}
