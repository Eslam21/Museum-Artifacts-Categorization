The king is wearing the Nemes headdress and a short kilt. One hand rests flat on his knee, while the other probably held a royal staff. The right side of the throne features an inscription of the royal names and epithets of the king, \"Horus, Appearance of Stability, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Shabataka, Beloved of Ptah, living forever.\" There is also a scene that is divided into two registers, or sections. The upper register features the Horus name and epithets of the king flanked by two large \"Was\" scepters. Below this are two figures of the Nile god, Hapy, a fecundity deity, kneeling and holding a Hotep sign. The lower register features a lion, the symbol of kingship. The rest of the register has fragments of hieroglyphic inscriptions, which were intended to praise the king's heroic power."}
