{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:267", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "0.8 cm", "Width": "1 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs. This example is of faience, produced in a mould, from which the features on the back and the inscription on the underside cannot easily be read. The central hieroglyph in the inscription may be the chessboard 'men', as part of Menkheperra, throne-name of Tuthmosis III, used widely in the long reign of the king and for centuries after his death as a talisman."}
