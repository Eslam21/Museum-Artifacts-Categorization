This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The name of Wahibra appears on a number of scarabs discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII no. 185 and 187; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII no. 27, 29 and no. 65). The inscription Wah-ib-ra, the prenomen of Psamtek I or nomen of Apries, is rather frequent on scarabs of the 26th dynasty (for example: Fraser 1900, 46, 374; Newberry 1906, pl. XXXVIII, 10; Hall 1913, 251, nos. 2506-2508; Petrie 1917, LV 26.1,19/ 21; Vercoutter 1945, 95, 5; Matouk 1971, 200, 835/ 221, 871-872; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 285, 469; Ben-Tor 1989, 79, 13; Jaeger 1993, 116; Magnarini 2004, 421, 11.77). Very close in composition to a steatite scarab found in Naukratis (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.1045). The winged sun, which normally occupies the upper register, is here replaced by an upside-down neb basket sign, which should occupy the lower register. Another rather similar type of scarab, but in stone, has a neb-basket sign at each end of the motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 187). This scarab could be a product from the Scarab Factory. If this were the case, Wahibre would refer to Apries rather than to Psamtek I (this is also suggested by Petrie: Petrie 1889, pl. 62, no. 1989). However, its craftmanship is of better quality and the scarab is much larger than the usual scarab produced at Naukratis. Ben-Tor, D. 1989.
