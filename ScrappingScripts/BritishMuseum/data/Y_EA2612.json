{"artifact_name": "kohl-pot; kohl-stick", "Object Type": [" kohl-pot ", " kohl-stick "], "Museum number": ["EA2612"], "Description": [" A terracotta kohl-pot modelled in the form of the hemhem crown, the inner element fluted, the outer left one ribbed, and the outer right with a pine-cone-like cross-hatched decoration; the flanking feathers are plain. The three main elements are supported by a palmette on either side of which is a large plain leaf. The flaring tops have three separate mouths, but the interior is not divided. The vessel stands on an oval ridged base; the underside details are hidden by a modern stand. The back is treated only summarily, the central palmette replaced by a plain leaf; a pierced suspension-lug is applied in the centre. The flask is supplied with a wooden rod-applicator surmounted by a carved standing falcon, 11.3 cm long; it is probably ancient but need not belong. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, covered with a brown slip: probably related to Memphis Black Ware. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": [" 3rdC BC(late) (?) ", " 2ndC BC (?)
