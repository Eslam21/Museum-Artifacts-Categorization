{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1413"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure head. A head of a man or boy, broken from a figure in which the head was thrust forward from the body. The face tends to the grotesque with puffed cheeks, and the hair is short, with a peak over the forehead; the strands are smooth. Hollow, from a two-piece mould. Remains of a white dressing on the flesh and the peak of hair, with traces of an orange-red paint on all these areas; a greyish deposit over a large part of the hair may be intentional, but was probably picked up during burial. Orange-brown Nile silt, with frequent fine gold mica, quartz and white inclusions.
