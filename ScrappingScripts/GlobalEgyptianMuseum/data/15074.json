A soft pillow or cushion would have made it more comfortable for the sleeper. Spell 166 of the Book of the Dead ensured protection for the head of the deceased in the afterlife by warding off demons who might attack. This headrest is similar in shape to a folding stool. The pillow holder of the headrest is made of strands of ivory beads stained dark green, red-brown, and black. The two sides are decorated with the face of the god, Bes of Joy, on their outer surface and a lotus flower on the inner surface. The legs end in ducks' heads."}
