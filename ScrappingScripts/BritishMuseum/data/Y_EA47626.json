The left most sign can be interpreted as a serekh, referring to the Horus name of the king. E. Naville, The XIth Dynasty Temple at Deir el-Bahari III, EEF Memoir 32, London 1913, 31, n. 1, notes that the fragment was found during the excavation of the temple, but was \u201cnot certainly found in the \u2018tomb\u2019\u201d and that on it \u201cseem to appear the signs of the king\u2019s Horusname\u201d.

Arnold interprets the object as a fragment of a box-shaped coffin (rather than an anthropoid coffin). He confirms the reading of nbw and mr.y and tries to explain Naville\u2019s reading by reconstructing a double line with Mentuhotep\u2019s names. He admits that the traces on the left are not easy to reconcile with the Horusname."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["poor (incomplete and cracked)"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Mentuhotep II"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1907"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA47626"], "Registration number": ["1907,1015.1"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 18 Sep 1992"]}
