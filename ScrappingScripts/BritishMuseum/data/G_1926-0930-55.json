{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.55"], "Description": [" Black terracotta figure of Zeus and his eagle. Zeus seated on his eagle, left leg crossed over right. A himation is draped over his head, covering his legs and falling down over the left shoulder. His sceptre rests diagonally against his left shoulder. The lower part, including the eagle\u2019s feet and the plinth, is lost: the break has been filed down in modern times to make the object stand. The back is plain except for a raised rim round a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous grey Nile silt (fired in a reducing atmosphere) with a black surface, probably a slip.
