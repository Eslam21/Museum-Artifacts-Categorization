{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 11236", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "14.5 cm", "Width": "9 cm", "Name": "Votive Stela with the Solar Symbols", "Description": "A simply carved stela that depicts figures of the sun and has no accompanying text. It was probably dedicated by a pious worshipper, as the sun god would be worshipped by pilgrims at Abydos. The principal, upper, scene shows the sun disk, illuminating the horizon and sending its rays from above. The other scene shows the solar boat embraced by two stylized arms. The sun is being worshipped by a standing baboon, a symbol of joyful animals, when the sun rises in the morning, warming and illuminating the universe. This is to be compared with the baboons depicted at the top of the facade of the temple at Abu Simbel, and at the bases of the obelisks of Ramesses The Second from Luxor temple."}
