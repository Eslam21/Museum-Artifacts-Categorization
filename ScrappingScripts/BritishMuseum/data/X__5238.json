", " As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). Amulets in the shape of Bes heads appear in the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 40). They were produced in Naukratis itself. Amulet-moulds with impression of Bes head of small size (smaller than this specimen) were discovered at the site (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 14): see for example BM 1888,0601.747 and BM 1920,0417.2. Similar amulets probably from the same mould: Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.555 and AN1896-1908-EA.862. See another close type, also discovered in Naukratis, but slightly smaller in size: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H1042.3.
