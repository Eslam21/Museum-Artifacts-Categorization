The white is of limestone, with naturalistic redder patches at each extremity, and the pupil may be of another stone. The eye was found in the rich burial placed in the northern chamber of a Middle Kingdom shaft tomb, about 1700 BC, dated by its other contents: fragments of a wooden coffin of a military officer, the 'commander of the ruler's crew' Sobekhotep (written over the name of the original owner of the coffin), an alabaster kohl-pot, fragments of gold foil, blue faience beads, a rock-crystal drop-pendant, and three pottery dishes. The other eye from the coffin was not retrieved. The burial lay in the south area of the north cemetery at Abydos, a crowded part of the necropolis in the late Middle Kingdom."}
