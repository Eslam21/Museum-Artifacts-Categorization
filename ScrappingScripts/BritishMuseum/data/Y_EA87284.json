{"artifact_name": "pendant; ear-ring; bead", "Object Type": [" pendant ", " ear-ring ", " bead "], "Museum number": ["EA87284"], "Description": [" One pendant, one ear-ring, two beads made of different materials. A: Small pendant made of faience, partly chipped off, flat at the rear and textured at the upper side in the shape of a mandrake with the lower part showing the leaves of the fruit. Remains of the lug at the top end. The lower end is broken off so that it is impossible to say if there was a second lug for a collar. The faience is preserved in a cream colour, white in the lower end and is probably eroded. B: Fragment of an ear-ring, made of shell, getting slightly thicker towards the end, the surface is well smoothed. C: Extended sphere bead with a ridge in the middle of the body, made of white faience. D: Disc-bead made of red faience.
