{"artifact_name": "weight", "Object Type": ["weight"], "Museum number": ["EA86704"], "Description": [" Small clay object, slightly conical in shape but with four sides, rounded square in section and on the base, possibly a weight. The top is tapered and shows a hole that runs into the body but stops at some point (not cleaned yet). One of the sides shows impressions of fingers as does the base. No seal impression can be seen on the object, more likely to have been used as a weight or might just have been the clay material used to seal the objects that was shaped in the hand. The top is blackened due to fire. The fine Nile clay has inclusions of mica and the object was hardened after the excavation.
