The inscription mentions that this Naukratite was a priest of Min (Yoyotte 1994-95, 671-673; Guermeur 2005, 135-137). Min appears however rarely in the material of Naukratis. See nonetheless the small bronze figure Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.86.71. Such amulets were \"presumably worn by men in order to assimilate the god's virile powers\" (Andrews 1994, 17).
