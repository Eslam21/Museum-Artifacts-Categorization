The central human figure is dark brown and large, points left facing right and up and are bent at the knee. Immediately above it are two smaller light brown figures parallel to one another, pointing right and facing down, the smaller of which is below the larger. Below them is a gesticulating figure in light brown, pointing right and facing up. To the top left are two figures, upright and facing left, the one on the right (woman?) with breasts. The central dark figure has what appears to be a white apron and anklet and is holding a long white object in its left hand. Above the dark central figure is an unidentified shape in light brown consisting of a long, straight line with an arrowhead-like shape at the top. The central dark figure has what appears to be a white apron and anklet and is holding a long white object in its left hand. The lighter figure to the left is also apparently wearing a white apron. The smaller figure appears to be wearing a skirt. To the right are the legs of a light brown figure, pointing left and cut off the edge of the image at the shin. At the top is the hindquarters of a white infilled cow pointing right which has been cut off the edge of the image and at the bottom are the tips of a pair of thick white infilled cattle horns cut off the edge of the image.

Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists. ", " Detail of 2013.2034.23.
