Near: Graindor 1939: pl. ii:9, with a central relief of a soldier wearing a Phrygian cap. Circular shields are common from Greek archaic times, and probably earlier, but this may be based upon Macedonian shields such as would be seen in Egypt from the later fourth century bc onwards. For a common pattern found on such shields, see a second-century bc flask from Karanis in Sekunda 1995: fig. 128. Full-scale limestone models of helmets and a Macedonian shield were found in Memphis, most of which are now in the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam (Gagsteiger 1993). Acquired from Cairo dealers, they were said to have been found in magazines or workshops, where they may have acted as guides for making actual armour.
