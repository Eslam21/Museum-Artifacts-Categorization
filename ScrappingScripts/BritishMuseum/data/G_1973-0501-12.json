{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.12"], "Description": [" Lower part of an Egyptian terracotta figure of an ithyphallic figure sitting on a stool, probably Harpocrates. The lower part of a man, modelled in the round, seated on rough support which rises from a crude sub-rectangular plinth. His feet rest on the plinth, and a huge phallus projects horizontally between his legs and is held up by a tapering support (damaged) rising from the plinth. The figure is lost from the waist up and a scar at the root of the phallus indicates that he was holding an object, possibly a pot or a musical instrument, in front of him. Apparently hand-modelled. Micaceous red Nile silt with a thick darkgrey core and a buff salt-induced surface.

One of numerous examples from, or probably from, Naukratis (Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1836; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA599; British Museum 1973,0501.18, 1973,0501.12, 1973,0501.30, 1973,0501.21; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum E.119.1914, E.98.1914; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.386). A similar hand-made ithyphallic Harpocrates figure was found in a 5th century BC Persian period deposit at the bottom of a well (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4653It; Hogarth 1905, 125; Hogarth 1903 Diary April 24th and 25th, well 2 bottom). Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum, UC48351, see also similar UC49892-3, but uncertain subject). The upper body fragments are identical to contemporary hand-made Persian rider figures from Naukratis and fragments can be hard to distinguish (see British Museum, 1886,0401.1468). Naukratis is the most likely source for these based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% is from Naukratis)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Terracotta / Catalogue of Terracottas in the British Museum (3253) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DC.078) (Phase 1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Lost from the waist up.
