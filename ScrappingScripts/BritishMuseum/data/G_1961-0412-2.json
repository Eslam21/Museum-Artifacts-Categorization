{"artifact_name": "jar-sealing", "Object Type": ["jar-sealing"], "Museum number": ["1961,0412.2"], "Description": [" Clay jar-sealing. A sealing of uncertain use, impressed with an intaglio rectangular stamp showing Aphrodite in a shrine. The goddess is naked, standing to front in an anadyomene pose, but not wringing her hair, her head in profile to her left; above her left hand is a round object, possibly a mirror or an apple. A minuscule Eros stands on each side, with arms raised towards her. The shrine has an arcuated pediment, with a ball or disc in the gable, and a row of raised points on the raking cornice; the apex is turned back on each side. The pediment is supported by Corinthian columns with moulded bases and spirally channelled shafts. In a panel below the shrine, at right angles to its verticality, is a draped male bust to right. The bust is possibly jugate or there may have been a double strike, not evident elsewhere on the sealing. The rear is roughly modelled, with a short linear impression on one side; the lower left corner is injured. Unfired micaceous light-brown clay, with white inclusions and some black ones. An intermittent line in a black substance is found on the back edges of the object: this may reflect the object that was sealed.
