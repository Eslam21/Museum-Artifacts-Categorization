{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1894:365.36", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Width": "0.9 cm", "Name": "Scarab with motif of a tilapia fish", "Description": "Steatite scarab with crudely incised head and v-marks on shoulders, and incised design on the underside showing a tilapia fish with lotus flowers emerging from its mouth. The fish and flower were symbols of rebirth in Egyptian art, because the blue lotus opens at sunrise and provides a strong scent, and the tilapia holds its eggs in its mouth before hatching, creating an image of self-reproduction. Both motifs become common, and are often paired, in the 18th Dynasty."}
