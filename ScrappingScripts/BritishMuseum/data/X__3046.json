{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta reclining ithyphallic figure. A naked child (Harpocrates?), modelled in the round on a low rectangular plinth, reclining with his legs extending to his right, the left leg flat to the ground, the right knee raised (mostly lost). He leans on a block with mouldings above and below. His huge phallus curves round in front of him. A duck or goose is held to his left side with his left hand, and his right hand reaches over, possibly strangling, the bird. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous light red-brown Nile silt with limestone inclusions. Surface is flaking due to salts erupting.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Two examples from Naukratis appear to be strangling a goose (British Museum GR1973,0501.24, Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1833). These are similar to other variants of reclining ithyphallic Harpocrates from Naukratis (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.3719; British Museum GR1973, 0501.19, GR1973,0501.20, GR1973,0501.36). Unprovenanced parallels are dated end of fourth, beginning of third century BC (Fischer 1994, no. 19) and are known from Ptolemaic Memphis (Petrie Museum UC48467, UC48376). Similar reclining Harpocrates figures were made of faience, found in a third century BC context at Athribis (Szyma\u0144ska 1999b, 73, fig. 2) and also found at Naukratis (British museum GR1886,0401.1495) and Karnak (Masson pers. com).
