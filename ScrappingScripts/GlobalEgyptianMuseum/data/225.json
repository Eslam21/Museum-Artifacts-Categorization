{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.1236", "Dating": "NAQADA II (not before); 1ST DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "DIMU ?", "Category": "KNIFE", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; UNSPECIFIED STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Width": "7.1 cm", "Name": "Flint knife", "Description": "The degree of technical difficulty and the symmetry achieved in the making of this large knife makes this object a masterpiece of cutting from the flint. A large block, detached from the side of flint, first received the general profile of a knife. Polished on the two sides, the knife was then subjected to carving, tracing grains in the shape of an S. Seeing that the majority of knives of this type has been found in tombs and that they lack traces of use, it is best to consider them as symbolic objects, like the diamond shaped knives."}
