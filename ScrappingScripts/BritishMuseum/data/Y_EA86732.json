{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86732"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows a convex rounded area like from a bag or suchlike (similar to EA86742, EA86756, EA86759 and EA86762) with the impression of a string of 0.25 cm width, a second thinner string impression perpendicular to the first one. The front shows the larger part of an oval scarab-like seal impression with a circumferential line. The seal is divided into three parts by vertical lines, in the outer two fields each a red crown. In the middle a symmetrical ornament, three out of four parts preserved showing each a raised middle part in a drop-shape from which two antithetical curled lines run of (like in the red crown).
