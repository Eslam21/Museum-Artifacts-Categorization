{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1167"], "Description": [" Fragmentary granite upper body of a king, the lower body now missing. He wears the nemes headcloth with the material tucked behind his ears, and the long striped lappets extending down onto his chest. Above his forehead is the uraeus cobra, now headless, with its coiled body extending over the top of the headcloth. His eyes are wide-set, slanted and narrow, with visibly sunken skin underneath. His eyebrows are conveyed as a slightly arched ridge. His nose has been broken off with an implement that has left behind a rectangular recess in the stone. His mouth is small with a slightly fleshier lower lip, and the outer corners are downturned creating a stern expression. His face is long in appearance, while his jawline is rounded and fleshy. A thick raised line around his neck possibly indicates a necklace. His chest is bare, with notable ridges at the breastbone area. The statue is damaged in several areas including the top and outer edges of the nemes headcloth on both sides, the left ear, and much of the left upper arm is also cracked.

The indication of the breastbone is also associated with 12th Dynasty sculpture (detailed with examples in Russmann 2001).
