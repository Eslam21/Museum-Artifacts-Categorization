{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 48406", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FAYENCE", "Height": "20 cm", "Width": "6 cm", "Name": "Shawabti of Ptahmose", "Description": "A remarkable statuette, made out of faience, depicts a Shawabti of Ptahmose, who was the vizier, the mayor, and the high priest of Amun at Thebes. Faience is a glazed, highly colored and decorated earthenware. A shawabti is a mummiform figure, placed in the tomb, to take the place of the deceased in performing certain manual tasks in the Afterworld. Although the tomb of this nobleman was at Thebes, this statuette was found in Abydos. Therefore, it could be considered as an ex-voto, an offering placed by Ptahmose or one of his family members in the domain of Osiris, so that Ptahmose might participate in the offerings presented to this god. The statuette shows Ptahmose in a mummiform where the body is enveloped in a close-fitting garment and the arms are crossed over the chest. Ptahmose is also protected by a vulture with outspread wings. A large collar adorns the neck of the statuette, while the headdress is striped yellow and violet. As for the hieroglyphic inscription that covers the body, it is an excerpt from Chapter Six of the Book of the Dead, known as the formula of the Shawabti."}
