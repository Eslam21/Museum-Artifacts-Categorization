This was Isma'il Pasha, Khedive (viceroy) of Egypt and Sudan from 1863 to 1879. The group was registered alongside other groups which came from the 1867 Paris Exhibition (one of which was given by A W Franks), and all these works were shown in that exhibition. The slips sometimes record their descriptions in French. A W Franks was one of three commissioners appointed to spend the Government grant for the purchase of objects at that exhibition (for what is now the V&A). All the objects in the group were recorded on the slips as from \"Eastern Central Africa\". This term was used at the time for the southmost part of Sudan, which abuts onto the modern Congo, the Central African Republic, Uganda and Kenya. This area was occupied by many different ethnic groups, some of which spill over the colonial borders into other countries. The identity of the donor implies that they were collected in Egyptian territory or in territory into which Egypt had made an expedition. The slips only occasionally record which ethnic group any object came from. So most attributions were made later by BM curators. Another comparable collection in the BM formed in the same area, but slightly earlier, is that of John Petherick (qv)."], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["Af.4390"], "Additional IDs": [" CDMS number: Af1867C1.4390 (old CDMS no.)
