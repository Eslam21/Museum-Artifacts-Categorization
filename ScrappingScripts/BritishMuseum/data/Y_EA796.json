{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA796"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Ramesesemperre\u2018: round-topped stela is divided into four registers with figures in sunk relief and incised texts. In the centre of the upper register Osiris is seated upon a throne and behind him stand Isis, Horus, son of Isis, and Thoth. In front of Osiris is a lotus blossom on which stand the four sons of Horus. On the right the chief guardian of the Ramesseum Ramesesemperre\u2018 stands with his arms raised in adoration. In the second register the goddess Nut stands in a tree on the right and pours a libation into the hands of the kneeling Ramesesemperre\u2018. Behind him sit five figures holding lotus blossoms: Panakhtremetj (?), Horemhat, Sutymose, Neferrenpet and Nakhtemwaset. In the third register six men and one woman are shown squatting on the ground and holding lotus blossoms: Sur, Khons, Khons, Panrenu, Any, Ptahemheb and Hwt-Hr. In the fourth register it is impossible to read anything apart from a few signs because it is too damaged. This register presumably consisted of more squatting or seated figures. This stela has suffered much surface damage. More deterioration has occurred since the photograph used here was taken, and large parts of the stela are illegible. There are no traces of colour.

Schulman suggested that the guardian of stela EA 796 might be identified with the royal butler (Schulman, 'Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt' 13 (1976), 117-30). There is no firm evidence for this suggestion, and it is not certain that the royal butler under Merenptah is the same man under Ramses III.
