The shape of the vase, based on the lower body sherd, can not be confirmed but the decoration is consistent with other cups with everted rims. If the sherd belongs to the Type 9, it would be more appropriately placed in his Type 9B or Type 9C. Schlotzhauer also explains that contrary to the common practice of inscribing dedications on the rim and upper body of cups with everted rims, the inscription on this cup is at the bottom of the vessel. Type 10 cups were mass produced and include numerous variants. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type V (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Vallet and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). Numerous Type 10 South Ionian cups have been found at Naukratis, as well as in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra and at Megara Hyblaea on Sicily, and at Berezan on the Black Sea (Posamentir 2006, 165). The place of production of the vase was determined as probably Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.1025) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric. Type 9 cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups and have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (p. 711, no. 688) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p.54, no. 21, p. 113-4, NAU 73, pl.15k-m) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.226) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.124"]}
