{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86689"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, with a convex rear, showing traces of a surface, maybe a leather bag or similar, with some finger prints on it, perpendicular to this another side with deep impressions of turned cord with a knot. The fine brown Nile clay seems to be a bit lighter in colour than the previous examples and contains small mica particles. The object was hardened after excavation. The top shows the half of a deep impression of a sharp cut scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal itself is only preserved in its upper half, showing a circumferential line and a standing deity (possibly Thoth) on the right facing to the left, wearing a sceptre in front of it. Left of the sceptre a very small nb-sign. Above the deity another hieroglyph, maybe an n without the zig-zag lines or a p.t?
