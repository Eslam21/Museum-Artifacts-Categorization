XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyemi and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of this pylon provided several rectangular plaques made in various materials- various metals and stones, as well as fragments of raw material, such as lapis lazuli and turquoise. Six plaques in lapis lazuli, like this one, were discovered in total: one in the north-east corner, two in the south-east one, two in the south-west one and one in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. XXV no. 29). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-west or south-east corner of the pylon. It is usual in Ptolemaic foundation deposits of that type that several uninscribed rectangular plaques are discovered and associated to only a few cartouche-shaped inscribed plaques (Weinstein 1973, 359-360).
