", " Scarabs with a winged sphinx motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 28-30, see especially 29 for this piece though the wings are omitted on the drawing). Gorton assigned this scarab to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A91-107, see especially A92 for this piece). The drawing of the motif is, however, more refined than usual and does not seem to be stamped, but rather carved with fine incisions. Its size and technique recall more her type XXXIV A (Gorton 1996, 121-123).
