The representations and inscriptions are rather hasty and inexact. In the lunette are the two udjat-eyes, which are typical for this period. Underneath them are three lines containing the offering formula invoking Osiris-Khentimentiu. In the main register is a seated man on the left facing an offering table with a huge heap of offerings.
