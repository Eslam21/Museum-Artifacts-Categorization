{"artifact_name": "cornice", "Object Type": ["cornice"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.69"], "Description": [" Fragment from the angle of a marble cornice. Corner fragments of a marble Ionic cyma without astragal. The fragment is decorated by a handing and in a right angle kinked lotus-blossom with volute coves on both endings of the core. On each side, seven-pedalled palmettes with tendrils hang upside down from the spirals. A rebate is worked on the top and the bottom is broken, but seems to have been rounded. The ornaments are sanded smoothly, while the relief background remains rough. The upper and back side of the light grey marble fragment are fractured.

Moreover, a detailed shaping of the corner suggests the connection to the fragments B 430, B 409 and B 407. The embedded surface of the underside is 0.90 cm deeper than the endings of the lotus-blossom and the relief background, which means that the existence of an astragal is very unlikely.
