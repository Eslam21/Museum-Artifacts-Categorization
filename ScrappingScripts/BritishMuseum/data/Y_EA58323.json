Vessels in the shape of hedgehogs are found in the Predynastic Period, but cosmetic containers of this type, with a criss-cross pattern representing the animal's spines, appear to be products of the New Kingdom to the Late Period. No deity ever took the form of the hedgehog, but this animal must have had some symbolic value. In the Old Kingdom a hedgehog head is shown on the prow of boats making the symbolic passage from this life to the next, and it might be identified with a form of the sun god. The awakening of hedgehogs from hibernation may also be seen as a symbol of rebirth. In several scenes hedgehogs are shown as inhabiting the deserts; by living there, on the edge of the ordered world, they could be seen as triumphing over adversity, and hence as another symbol of continued life.
