The dispute became so hostile that one of the parties went so far as sealing up the tomb, thereby preventing any further mummies from being interred or removed. The case had been referred to the appropriate authorities to be resolved. The writer of the text had lost the dispute and accordingly signed a written oath stating that his claim had been invalid and issuing instructions for the tomb to be reopened, therefore allowing the other person to carry out his duties. The text on the interior of the ostracon is a summary of that on the exterior, suggesting that this is simply a draft for a more comprehensive record. Regulski, I. (ed.), 2022.
