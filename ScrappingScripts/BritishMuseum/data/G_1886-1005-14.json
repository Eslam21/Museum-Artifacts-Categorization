The foot on this cup is very narrow in comparison with the lip of the cup which is also frequently observed on the Corinthian versions. Corinthian kotylai have horizontal handles situated directly beneath the rim, the lug handles on this miniature kotyle may be explained by the limitations created by the size of the vessel. For parallels, see British Museum 1864,1007.1427 from Rhodes."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (IA.21)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,1005.14"]}
