The lack of rim and other diagnostic elements prevents the confirmation on the cup shape. Type 5 cups are both the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). Type 9 cups were the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis and the shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Both types have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 54, no. 3) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.098) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.276"]}
