Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Full size polychrome vignette of Hunefer in judgement scene. From left: above, Hunefer kneels in adoration before a company of deities, who are named as Ra, Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Hu and Sia, and the Southern, Northern and Western 'roads'. Below, the jackal-headed Anubis leads Hunefer towards the balance of judgement, where Anubis is depicted again, kneeling to adjust the plumb-weight on the balance. On the left scale-pan is Hunefer's heart, and on the right the feather hieroglyph which symbolises Maat. Below the balance crouches Ammit, the 'Devourer of the Damned', accompanied by a short inscription which describes her: 'Her front is a crocodile, her rear a hippopotamus, her middle a lion.' To the right, Thoth, ibis-headed, holds a pen and scribal palette to record the outcome of the weighing. Horus then conducts Hunefer to a shrine in which Osiris sits enthroned, accompanied by the goddesses Isis and Nephthys. The four Sons of Horus stand on a large lily (lotus) which grows from a pool of water beneath Osiris' throne. The lines of inscription above the scenes contain passages from spell 30B of the Book of the Dead. Composition is framed on top and bottom with red and yellow lines. Very little text/image loss except for yellow paint which has faded. Bibliography: M.A. Corzo, Nefertari Luce d'Egitto, Rome 1994, pp. 176-80 [43]. Tarasenko, Mykola. 2016.
