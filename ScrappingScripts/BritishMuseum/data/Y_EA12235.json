Perhaps originally the 'djed' represented a stylized tree trunk with lopped off branches. Certainly, at first, when it was associated with Sokar, the funerary god of the Memphite necropolis and later with Ptah, the Memphite creator god, the ritual raising of the djed involved pulling a huge djed upright by ropes in the manner of a maypole. However, by the time an amulet in its shape had become one of the prescribed funerary amulets, it was associated only with Osiris, god of the dead, and considered to represent his stylized backbone and ribs. Chapter 155 of the 'Book of the Dead' required a djed pillar amulet to be made of gold, but very many are of a green material, as here, a colour with regenerative connotations.
