{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA30715"], "Description": [" Wooden tomb statue of a man: the arms, fronts of the feet, and base were made separately. Both of the fists were drilled to hold implements now lost, probably a 'sekhem' scepter in the right hand, possibly another baton or a rolled cloth in the left. Though the statue may have been entirely painted, all that survives is black on the hair, black and white on the eyes, and white on the finger- and toenails. The nipples were indicated by the inlaying of tiny bits of darker wood. His short curly hairdo was particularly popular during the Eleventh and early Twelfth Dynasties, for both men and women. His long kilt - may be meant to indicate maturity here, despite the youthful hairstyle and body.
