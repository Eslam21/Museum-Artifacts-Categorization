The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of Naukratis provided a wide variety of models of ceremonial instruments and tools. Fourteen were made of copper alloy, ten of stone and four of iron. Two hoes in iron were discovered in the foundation deposits: one in the north-east corner and one in the south-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. 25 no. 5). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the south-west corner of the pylon. Models of ceremonial instruments and tools are a customary feature in foundation deposits since the Middle Kingdom. They tend to be of small size and poor quality in the Ptolemaic Period, as during the Late Period (Weinstein 1973, 297, 307-308, 356). Model tools in iron are unusual and not attested in foundation deposits of the Late Period (normally made of copper alloy: Weinstein 1973, 297). Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
