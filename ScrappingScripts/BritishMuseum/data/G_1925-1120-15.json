{"artifact_name": "model building/structure", "Object Type": ["model building/structure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.15"], "Description": [" Terracotta model naos. A model stool, roughly square, with a curved seat and four legs of stylized animal form. The front, between the legs, is decorated as the fa\u00e7ade of a shrine, with a door cut through for the insertion of a miniature lamp. An architrave is supported by columns, above which are a row of dentils and a cornice; at the bottom, the columns have steps between them. The sides are plain and the back, again between the stool\u2019s legs, has an incuse chevron. There is slight damage on one side. Hollow; two-piece mould, the join running diagonally from the front left to the right rear; the seat and a rough floor were added after the object left the mould. Micaceous orange-red Nile silt with a redbrown surface. Traces of a white dressing overall; one of the rear legs seems to have had a pale-pink paint applied.
