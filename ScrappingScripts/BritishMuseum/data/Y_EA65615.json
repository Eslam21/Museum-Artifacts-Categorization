The cornflower pendants in the lower row are of gold foil over a core, the blue glazed composition head is held in position by a gold spike. Only the central example is completely of glazed composition (green patterned body, yellow head), but it also is in two parts. The drop shaped pendants are of sheet gold punched into a mould with a back plate added later. They have a suspension loop at top and bottom to accommodate two strings of beads, as now re-strung. The variously shaped gold beads are all of thin sheet metal folded over and joined along one edge. The remaining larger beads and a handful of the smaller are of red jasper, cornelian and green glass; all the others are of red, yellow and blue glazed composition. The upper string ends in a single hollow sheet gold pendant shaped like a bunch of grapes; the lower ends in two cornelian bell shaped flower heads.
