{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86913"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a layer of light brown accretion on parts of the surface. The rear shows one side with a larger row of basketry coil and a second side with two smaller rows of basketry coil suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side is flat and about three quarters of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable is the cartouche of Me[n]-kheper-[Ra] in the centre and to the left of it a cobra with wings in protection gesture. There are other hieroglyphic(?) signs to the right of it but not legible. The same motif can be found on EA86913.
