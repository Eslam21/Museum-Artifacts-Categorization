It has a serrated, or saw-toothed, rim and a bulging belly. It once had a floral decoration that is now missing. A larger pomegranate vase that was made of silver is considered to be the finest metal vessel in Tutankhamun's collection. The pomegranate was brought to Egypt from Asia following the campaigns of Tuthmosis the Third. Perhaps, this explains its popularity as a vessel shape during the later years of the Eighteenth Dynasty."}
