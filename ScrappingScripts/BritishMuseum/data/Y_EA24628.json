{"artifact_name": "model building/structure", "Object Type": ["model building/structure"], "Museum number": ["EA2462"], "Description": [" Limestone model of a house. Three storeys are depicted, with two doors on the ground level, and square windows on the upper floors (the middle floor windows feature cross-braces, while those above are represented with mesh coverings, perhaps of wood or metal). The sculptor has indicated the exterior brickwork, with courses rising towards the corners of the building. This construction method is typical of Third Intermediate and (especially) Late Period mudbrick architecture. The top of the model is damaged, but a rooftop space is suggested.
