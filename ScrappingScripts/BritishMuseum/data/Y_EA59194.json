{"artifact_name": "plaque", "Object Type": ["plaque"], "Museum number": ["EA59194"], "Description": [" An openwork gold plaque: decorated with figures of the king offering to a god. The scene represents King Makherure (Amenemhat IV) offering a vase of unguent to Atum, god of the setting sun. The frame is composed of two uprights supporting the sign for heaven ('pt') with a bar along the bottom. The god wears the double crown with uraeus, a collar and a tunic with straps over his shoulders. From his sloping belt hangs a tail, now broken. The front of his kilt is tied in the 'Girdle of Isis' knot ('tit'). In his right hand he carries an 'ankh-amulet and in his left a 'was'-sceptre. He is bearded. The king wears the 'khat' bag-wig with uraeus, the kilt with tail and the 'shendiyt'-apron. He holds an unguent container in his hands. Between the two figures are the hieroglyphs. The technique is true ajour\u00e9, i.e. cutting out from a piece of sheet metal. The details are chased. Solder can be seen in some places, notably at Atum's feet. The reverse bears no surface decoration. Three pins are soldered on to this side, one in the centre of the 'pt'-sign, the others at the top of each of the figure's legs. There are no rings for suspension.

The lack of suspension rings and its pins make it more likely to have been the covering for a cylindrical amulet similar to 1896,0511.41 (see The British Museum, 'A Guide to the Third and Fourth Egyptian Rooms' (London, 1904), 32, no. 18; E. A. Wallis Budge 'A Guide to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Egyptian Rooms, and the Coptic Room' (London, 1922), 218, 18) or the decoration from a small box or ointment container (see 'Comptes Renus. Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (Paris, 1928), 34), held in position by the three pins on the reverse side. 1896,0511.41 is in the Department of the Ancient Near East: it is a cylinder seal of gold ajour\u00e9 work banded round a core of malachite. A king wearing the 'atef'-crown is pouring a libation before a deity who holds a 'was'-sceptre and wears a pointed crown. In another scene on the same object the god is placing a crown on the king's head. The provenance of this piece is not recorded, but it is probably Phoenician. Bibliography: 'Comptes Renus.
