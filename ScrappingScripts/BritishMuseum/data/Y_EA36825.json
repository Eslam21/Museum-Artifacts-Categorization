{"artifact_name": "scribal palette", "Object Type": ["scribal palette"], "Museum number": ["EA36825"], "Description": [" Rectangular wooden scribal palette. The upper surface is cut with a row of 9 oval ink wells, with two longer and narrower ink wells in one corner. These wells bear traces of the red, yellow and black pigments used by the owner. A column of inscription, set within a recess, starts with the title 'outline draughtsman (sesh-qed)', but the name of the individual has been erased (other than the male determinative). Beneath the pen-slot, a horizontal inscription states 'the outline draughtsman, Min-nakht, true of voice'. Beneath, in thick back ink strokes, three signs are roughly drawn: a falcon head wearing a sun-disc and uraeus, and two examples of a disc and crescent. The top left corner bears an incised inscription on the thickness of the palette, wrapped around the corner: 'Amun-Ra' and 'Ptah lord of Maat'.
