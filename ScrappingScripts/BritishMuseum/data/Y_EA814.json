{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA814"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Irynefer: round-topped stela divided into two registers with scenes in sunk relief and incised texts. In the upper section the necropolis-workman Irynefer, with an offering in one hand, kneels in adoration on the right before an altar heaped with offerings. The name of the workman is garbled as the male determinative is placed before the nefer sign. On the left is the goddess Hathor in the form of a cow standing in a kiosk on a sledge. Above her is a one-winged sun disk. The two registers are divided by a line of text. Below are eight columns of text with a prayer to Hathor on behalf of Irynefer. He kneels in the bottom right-hand corner in an attitude of adoration. The stela is well preserved apart from an ancient repair which has been inserted into its centre, possibly to replace a nodule of flint or some ancient damage. Several signs terminate at the edge of the repair which might indicate that they were fully carved before the damage and repair. The edges of the stela are battered in places. The upper and lower edges are covered in black paint, probably modern.
