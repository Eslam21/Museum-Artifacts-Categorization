There is a distinct shoulder, from which the sides converge to a narrow neck, at one side of which is a loop-handle. The top of the neck is finished with a flared rim, which is slightly damaged. The jug has been reconstructed from fragments with some pieces missing. The exterior (and perhaps interior) is covered by a thin pale greenish slip.
