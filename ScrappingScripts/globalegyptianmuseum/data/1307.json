The piece probably comes from his tomb at Dira 'Abu el-Naga in the Theban necropolis. The Brussels Museum has two other shabtis belonging to the same man (E.6388 and E.7527), who lived at the end of the Ramesside Period. All three are atypical in that they bear Spell 5 from the Book of the Dead rather than Spell 6, which usually decorates the funerary statues."}
