{"artifact_name": "lintel", "Object Type": ["lintel"], "Museum number": ["EA547"], "Description": [" Limestone lintel with Djehutyhermaktef: fragment of a lintel decorated in sunk relief with incised texts of which twelve columns survive. Osiris is enthroned on the left behind an altar heaped with offerings. The text also names the goddess Hathor, but no representation of her is preserved. On the right of the altar stands the necropolis-workman Djehutyhermaktef with his arms raised in adoration. The text refers to him as [his] son. He is followed by a young girl, an adult female and another young girl. The relief is much worn.

A list of his monuments can be conveniently consulted in K. A. Kitchen, 'Ramesside inscriptions : translated & annotated Translations Vol.3, Ramesses II, his contemporaries' (Oxford, 2000), 839-44 and G.

His wife is named as the lady Werner, and she can be identified as the adult female on this lintel. The young girls are thus the daughters of Djehuthermaktuf, although not attested elsewhere. Because of the reference to 'son' in the description of Djehuthermaktuf, this piece probably comes from the tomb of his father Nebdjefau.
