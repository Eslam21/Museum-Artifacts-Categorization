{"artifact_name": "inlay", "Object Type": ["inlay"], "Museum number": ["EA64272"], "Description": [" Mosaic slice: a Horus falcon, in profile, standing, facing left on a translucent dark-blue field. The bird is beautifully rendered with polychrome plumage in red, green, white, black, and yellow. The headdress appears to be the double crown but this area is either misfired or damaged. A small hole was bored in the upper background apparently to facilitate the attachment. The left edge is broken with the loss of the front of the face and body.
