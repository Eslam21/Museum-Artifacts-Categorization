Each was made by casting in two parts, i.e. a cylindrical container with three legs and a domical lid. They originally had a long handle but this is almost always missing, as on the present example. The lids were pierced prior to inlaying, the purpose being to allow the fragrant smoke from the frankinsense, placed over hot coals,to leave the burner. Inscription: Within me is the fire of Hell, but without float the perfumes of paradise.\u2019 (translated Professor Doris Behrens-Abouseif).
