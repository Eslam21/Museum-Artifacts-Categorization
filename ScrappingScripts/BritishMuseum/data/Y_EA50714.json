Explicit depictions of erotic and sexual acts were uncommon in formal iconography, although nakedness was abundantly shown in Egyptian art. The purpose of such scenes is uncertain: sexual activity was associated with religious festivity, but the nature of the 'Erotic Papyrus' in Turin and the sketchiness of this and other examples suggest a frivolous, throw-away quality, like doodles on papyri. The hieroglyphic caption in front of the woman reads \u2018gentle is the charm of my skin\u2019. The use of hieroglyphic isntead of hieratic script may suggest that the scene parodies more formal art styles. For this type of representation cf. Jos. A. Omlin, 'Der Papyrus 55001 und seine Satirisch-erotischen Zeichnungen und Inschriften' (Turin, 1973), p. 35, scene 9. Bibliography: L.
