The original, in pink granite, is 13.18 metres tall and was taken from Karnak to Constantinople by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century AD. Probably in 357, Constantius had it taken to Rome where it was erected in front of the Circus Maximus. Several centuries later it fell and broke into three pieces. In 1588 the obelisk was re-erected in the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano.This copy was not done from the original but from drawings by Athanasius Kircher (1652), presumably in the 17th century."}
