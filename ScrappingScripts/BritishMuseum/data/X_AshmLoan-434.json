", " The sherd joins Oxford AN1896-1908-G.129.1c and belongs to the same vase as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.129.1a, AN1896-1908-G.129.1b and AN1896-1908-G.129.1e. It was transferred from the British Museum, where it had the reg. no. 1886,0401.1250 (Vase B102.26). Cook states that the coarse execution of the decoration on this vase is very unusual in Clazomenian black-figure. The fabric of the joining sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the fabric found great similarities with the fabric from Wild Goat Style sherds found at Bayrakli in Asia Minor, which Dupont had attributed production to Clazomenae. Based on the similar composition types, Dupont then suggested that the place of production for the joining sherd ought to be situated near Clazomenae, Erythrae, or Teos (Boardman 1986, 664).
