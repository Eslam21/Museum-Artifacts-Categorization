{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA35628"], "Description": [" Grey glazed composition stela of Paser: the figures and text which appear on both sides of this stela are deeply cut and inlaid with white glaze. The feet and lower part of a 'was'-sceptre of a standing god are preserved on the left of one side facing the lower part of a standing figure in a long kilt, probably the god Amun being adored by Paser. Below the figures is a text which gives the name and titles of Paser. On the other side of this piece the figure of an official, doubtless Paser, appears on the left, and three columns of text on the right contain the name and titles of Paser, as does a horizontal line of text at the bottom. Only the lower portion of this piece is intact, and parts of the surface and inlaid glaze have been lost. The white inlay that remains has gone brown in places.
