{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 46506", "Dating": "TAHARQA/KHUNEFERTEMRE", "Archaeological Site": "NURI", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "35 cm", "Name": "Shawabti of Taharqa", "Description": "The shawabti of King Taharqa that was found in his tomb at Nuri in Upper Nubia is shaped like a wrapped human body. It is wearing a wig and has a long curved beard. A shawabti is a statuette intended to perform work in place of the deceased in the underworld. This shawabti has typical Nubian facial features: full thick lips, a broad nose, and slightly bulging eyes, which realistically portray the features of the king. Below his hands is the shawabti formula that ensures that the shawabti will substitute for the deceased pharaoh whenever work is called for in the afterlife. The shawabti holds a pair of hoes with blades against his shoulders and a rope attached to a basket, which is shown on his back. Notably, his hands are held to his chest and are not crossed like earlier ancient Egyptian examples. However, the way in which the body is carved plus the use of the shawabti magical formula reflect a strong revival of Egyptian influence among the Nubians in the Late Dynastic Period."}
