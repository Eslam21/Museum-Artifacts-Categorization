It bears a typical offering scene. On the right is the figure of a woman in a long dress and a long wig, with armlets and anklets as well as a narrow necklace, smelling a long-stemmed lotus flower. Opposite her is the male tomb owner dressed in a white kilt and a panther skin. In his left hand he holds an amulet, perhaps an ankh. Both figures are seated on chairs with animal legs and back supports, and there is a chest placed beneath each chair. An offering table laden with stylized loaves of bread is placed between them. To the left and right of the table stand two jars. Above the scene is a horizontal inscription in three lines. Behind the man is a vertical inscription in two lines."}
