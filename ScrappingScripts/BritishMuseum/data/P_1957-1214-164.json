The Flight into Egypt was a recurrent subject across Claude\u2019s painted career, and he generally deployed a consistent formula in the construction of the scene. This is one exception to the rule. Not only is it of a vertical format, which was a rarity within the Liber, it also depicts the Holy Family at the edge of a river, embarking or disembarking from a boat that domaintes the scene. This latter motif can be traced back to Annibale Caracci\u2019s Aldobrandini\u2019s lunette, and also adopted by Domenichino and Grimaldi among others. Claude\u2019s composition was developed across various preparatory drawings, including on the the BM (see Oo,7.168) which focuses on the trees that dominate the painting and which mau have been made from life. The painting that it records was the first of eight to be commissioned by Prince Colonna, the others being LV162, 167, 175, 178, 186, 190 and 193, who was arguably Claude\u2019s most important client of his latter career. The painting is now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid (see inv. no. 226 (1966.3); canvas, 193 x 147 cm; Roethlisberger 1986, no. 229), and comparison with it shows that Claude was faithful in his recording of this composition in the Liber with the exception of slightly englarging the figures. The present sheet is also of note for the long insceiption on the verso which contains the first accurate record of the number of sheets within the Liber (for the first attempt see 1957,1214.161) and which was likely triggered by the writing up of Claude\u2019s will just two days earlier on 28 Febuary 1663 (for which see Roethlisberger 1961, pp. 64\u201371).
