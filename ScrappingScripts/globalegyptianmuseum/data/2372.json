The motif in the damaged upper area is not clear, but appears to include two detailed udjat-eyes, symbols of good health, and at centre the djed-pillar, emblem of the stability of Osiris, god of the dead. The stela was excavated at Memphis, with numerous other examples invoking the principal deity at that city, the creator and patron of crafts, Ptah."}
