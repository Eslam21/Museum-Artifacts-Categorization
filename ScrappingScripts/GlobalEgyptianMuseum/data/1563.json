{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1899:342", "Dating": "NAQADA II", "Archaeological Site": "EL-KOM EL-AHMAR/HIERAKONPOLIS/NEKHEN", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Height": "23.5 cm", "Diameter": "15 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Pottery vase with flat base, convex profile and short, wide neck. There is a decorative, rather than functional wavy handle on both sides. The vessel was found in one of the fourth millennium BC graves at the key early settlement near Kom el-Ahmar (the Hierakonpolis of later texts) in southern Upper Egypt. From this and other burial goods in the rich tomb, the burial can be dated to the end of the Naqada II Period, on the eve of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in the final stage of state formation. During this period Kom el-Ahmar was a major centre of the emerging Egyptian kingship."}
