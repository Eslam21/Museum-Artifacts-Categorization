", " This fragmentary lekythos might come from a large cache of bronze votives discovered in 1885 in a house to the south of the town (Petrie 1886, 41-42). Petrie mentioned among the finds a \u2018small brown vase with black net pattern of cross lines, and white spots at the crossings\u2019. Other net-patterned lekythoi from Attica were found inNaukratis. This example however was acquired in 1885 and is kept in the British Museum, as are all non-bronze finds identified as belonging to the cache (Masson 2015). The cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis. Part I., 1884-5 (Third Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund), London.
