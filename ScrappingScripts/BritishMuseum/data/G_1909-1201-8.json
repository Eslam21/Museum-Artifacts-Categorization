{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1909,1201.8"], "Description": [" Light grey limestone head of a kouros figure, painted. Head of a young man, broken at the base of the neck from a statuette. The right cheek and earlobe are damaged. The face is oval with a pointed chin, a long aquiline nose, wide protruding eyes; the eyebrows and the outline of the eyes show traces of black paint. The mouth is small and shaped into a smile, with traces of red paint; a moustache was rendered in relief and painted in black, a full beard was indicated from the temples down to the upper edge of the neck by means of black spots. The hair is worked as a flat mass parted in the centre and falling like a wig down to the neck; the ears are not covered and rawly treated. There are traces of black paint on the hair; on the forehead a thin red headband was painted right below the hairline. The back is worked flat.

Of the same family as the Leipzig and Golenischeff statuettes, which are ascribed to Samos; the broad rounded face contrasts with the two preceding numbers (Sculptures B438-9). 'The head is an advanced example, probably of the third quarter of the sixth century B.C' (Pryce, B440). Nick (2006, 56) states that the date suggested by Pryce - 3rd quarter of the 6th century BC - is too late and argues in favour of a slightly earlier date based on characteristic features found for example in the gypsum alabaster statuette Cairo 27425."], "Bibliographic references": [" Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum (B440) ", " Nick 2006 / Zypro-ionische Kleinplastik aus Kalkstein und Alabaster (cat. 21, p. 113; pp. 54-57; pl. 10) ", " Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 86, pl.
