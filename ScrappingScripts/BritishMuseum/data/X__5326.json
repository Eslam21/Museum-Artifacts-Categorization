This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Several bronzes representing Isis nursing Horus were discovered in Naukratis. No less than six of them were discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41-42; Masson 2015). This figure could pertain to this hoard since it was discovered during the first season of excavation at Naukratis. This group-figure belongs to the type G12 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, Pl. 56, see also Nr. 1508 for this specimen). It became truly popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (for example: Grenier 2002, 51-58, pl. VIII-X; Goddio and Fabre 2008, 318-9 no. 178-180; Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314). Isis nursing is also a theme which is popular in other material in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). The very flat and crude design featured on this figure is found on other Naukratite bronzes, such as: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.247, 86.251, 86.261, 86.253 and 86.284; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.616; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,101.c; BM 1885,1101.568 and BM 1885,1101.91.
