Her hands grasp a cylindrical stone that she is using as a millstone. In front of the woman, there is an oblong stone with raised ends along which she rolls the millstone. She is dressed only in a short skirt. Her nude torso reveals well-developed muscles. Her head is raised and she is looking ahead, as if to detach herself mentally from the hard task in which she is engaged. Her face is carved with great care and is extremely expressive. Her curly hair, carved in detail, spreads out on either side of her face. It is held with a ribbon that hangs down to the nape of her neck."}
