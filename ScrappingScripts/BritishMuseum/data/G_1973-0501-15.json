{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.15"], "Description": [" Terracotta seated ithyphallic figure of Harpocrates with jar. A youthful figure, modelled in the round, seated on a block with his head turned to his right; his feet and the block are set on a low rectangular plinth. He is naked, with a shaved head and side-lock. A large phallus emerges horizontally from between his legs, on which he rests a large pot, held by both his hands. Solid; probably made in a two-piece mould, with some subsequent manipulation. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with considerable remains of a white dressing overall. The flesh is painted pink, except for the phallus, which is black with red paint on the glans. The pot is also painted black and the block remains largely white, with areas of red paint. The plinth has blue paint on its upper surface. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (early, ?)

Similar examples GR1973,0501.17, GR1973,0501.40, GR1973,0501.44 and GR1973, 0501.51 are all very similar in style, fabric and subject as NA587 and NA597 from Naukratis, currently in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology. GR1973,0501.17 is from the same mould as NA587 from Naukratis.
