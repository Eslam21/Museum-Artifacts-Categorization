It corresponds to the \u2018upper part of a large figure of Bast\u2019 listed by Petrie. The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). This figure belongs to the type 106 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 201-202, 666-669, Taf. 29 a-d, Taf. 73, Typ 106). Bronze figures of Mahes were mainly discovered in Leontopolis and Bubastis where his cult as the son of Bastet was the most dynamic. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
