{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "95", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "35.5 cm", "Width": "20.7 cm", "Depth": "5.5 cm", "Name": "Tomb stela for Kety and Senet", "Description": "Two young women are standing opposite each other holding lotus flowers to their noses. In the other hand, they are holding a small cloth. Kety (on the right) is represented slimmer and leaner than her sister. Her dress shows a rare lozenge pattern. On the offering table in between the pair lie two calves' heads and one goose head, who are to be understood pars pro toto -as in hieroglyphic writing- as meaning \"oxen and fowl\". The somewhat rigid two-dimensional relief is of a high artistic quality, full of life, elegance and individual differentiation."}
