The remaining objects in the Registration Sequence EA 1911,0710.92 to 106 apparently came from 26th-Dynasty contexts at Naukratis. They are both handmade and mould-made, and several of them are Cypriote. 'This appears stylistically to be later than the seventh- to sixth-century objects registered with it; a fifth- or fourth-century BC date seems more likely' (Bailey 2008, 186, Terracotta IV). Bailey suggests this is an Egyptian and figurine, with comparanda that all come from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1896-1908.E4790, thought to be from Naukratis; Coulson et al. 1996, 143, fig. 54:11, suggesting Hellenistic date; Near: Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, GR.16.1899). The clay is very fine and, though similar to Nile silt, more likely to be East Greek. This is not a terracotta figure, but a mould-made piece from a rhyton."], "Bibliographic references": [" Terracotta / Catalogue of Terracottas in the British Museum (3762) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DB.421) (Phase 1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair (incomplete -head only; ear missing)"], "Subjects": ["horse/ass"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1911"], "Acquisition notes": ["1885-1886 season."], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA50120"], "Registration number": ["1911,0710.95"]}
