{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "233", "Dating": "22ND DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FEMALE MUMMY", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED MAN MADE MATERIAL", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Width": "38 cm", "Name": "Mummy of Nes-Khons in cartonnage covering", "Description": "The mummy of Nes-Khons, daughter of Amenhotep. The fracture of the left thighbone may have been caused after death during the process of embalming, or shortly before the woman's death. The brain was removed via the nose. In the thoracic cavity we find two layers of waste matter. The incision in the abdomen for the removal of the intestines was made on the right-hand side.With the help of computerised tomographic investigation, the shadowy parts in the pelvic area and between the knees, already visible on digital cross-cut x-rays, turned out to be the bodies of two children. They must have died at some point between the beginning of the ninth month of pregnancy and the normal time of birth and may have been twins. The bodies of the children have not been mummified. The cartonnage covering is still laced up and unopened."}
