", " The \"Scarab Factory\" in Naukratis produced variants of the name of Amun-Ra on scarabs and scaraboids made out of glazed composition (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 25 and 36; on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). It is possible that this stone scarab was also produced locally or used as a model.
