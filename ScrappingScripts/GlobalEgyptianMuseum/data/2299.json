{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:272", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARABOID", "Material": "POTTERY; STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "INCISION; GLAZED", "Height": "1.7 cm", "Width": "0.6 cm", "Name": "Cowroid", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs and scaraboids. This example is a cowroid, with the upper part in the shape of the shell, and the underside flat like a scarab-seal. The small scale and poor quality of moulding prevent identification of the motif."}
