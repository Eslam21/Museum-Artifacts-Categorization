The Ptolemies presented themselves as the rulers of Egypt with sculpture decked in pharaonic regalia. The locks of hair, peeping out from under the royal head-dress or Nemes, mirror the taste of the period. In this case the facial characteristics and the lock at the side clearly point to a young age. This is probably a prince depicted as Horus the child (Harpocrates)."}
