{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:77", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "CROCODILE MUMMY ?", "Name": "Forepart of a baby crocodile", "Description": "Forepart of a small crocodile. In the absence of any traces of linen bandages, it is not certain that this is from an ancient mummified example, rather than a more recent natural history specimen. However, one large crocodile mummy from Kom Ombo, now in the British Museum, had sets of small crocodiles laid along its back and head in the process of mummification. There are also examples of baby crocodiles mummified as separate votive offerings. The practice of mummifying animals and birds became common after 700 BC."}
