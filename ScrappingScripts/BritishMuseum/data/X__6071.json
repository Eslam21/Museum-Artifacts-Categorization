", " No known provenance (no provenance given in Bolton Museum register). Published in Nick, 2006. cat.59, p.124; pp.71-72; pl.24. Faintly marked \u03a6 (Sanctuary of Aphrodite?). Representations of falcons are rarely found on Cyprus - with the exception of those from Salamis. There are much more commonly dedicated in the eastern Mediterranean, on Rhodes, in Cnidos, in the Delian Heraion, in Miletus and in the Heraion on Samos. The bird can be shown on its own like this one but also with a snake or another bird in its beak or with an Egyptian double crown on its head.The rendering of the falcon is based on the Egyptian Horus falcon. The rendering of the body relies on Egyptian figures of the late period and faiences as they were found all across the eastern mediterranean including Naukratis and as they were produced in Naukratis. The parallels from datable contexts from Samos, Lindos and Vroulia allow for the falcon to be dated not later than the middle of the sixth century BC.
