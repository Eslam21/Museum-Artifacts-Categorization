{"artifact_name": "jar", "Object Type": ["jar"], "Museum number": ["EA22559"], "Description": [" Calcite jar: cylindrical with a wide rim and a flat foot. The vessel bears inscriptions filled with blue pigment. The vertical hieroglyphs give the titulary of Pepy I. On the right is the main cartouche name of the king, his birth name Pepy, with the title \"king of upper and lower Egypt,\" within the cartouche he is also called \"son of Hathor mistress of Dendera.\" The middle name is his Horus name, Merytawy, written in a 'serekh'. The left-hand column gives two of his other names, the 'nebty' or \"two ladies\" name, Merykhet, and the so-called \"Golden Horus\" name, which is not easy to translate but is written with three falcons. The only name missing from the jar is the second cartouche or throne name, Meryre. In one horizontal line at the bottom is repeated twice \"given life and dominion forever.\" "], "Authority": ["Ruler: Pepy I"], "Cultures/periods": ["6th Dynasty"], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Egypt "], "Materials": ["calcite"], "Technique": [" incised ", " pigmented "], "Dimensions": [" Diameter: 15.80 centimetres ", " Height: 15.30 centimetres ", " Weight: 1.328 kilograms "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Inscription subject": ["royal"], "Curator's comments": ["This cylindrical jar is of a type which became common for a period in the 6th 1 Dynasty; many vessels with similar inscriptions of Pepy I and Pepy II are known, but few mention other kings. These jars show the skill with which craftsmen of the later 3rd millennium BC could work stones such as calcite. These jars were perhaps luxury productions of royal workshops. Although none have been found in a good archaeological context, they may have been placed in the royal burial or given as marks of favour to important officials of the time. Bibliography: B.
