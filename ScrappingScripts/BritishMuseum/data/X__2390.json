", " The placement of the elaborate rosette is the same as that on the Aphrodite Bowl. Though possibly not by the painter of the Aphrodite Bowl himself, this sherd fits into Lemos's Group of the Aphrodite Bowl. Lemos describes the interior decoration on the sherd as a goose, but the type of eye depicted is not seen on geese and is more typical of goats. However, if this is a goat, its position is unclear, as it would appear that its neck is twisted in a highly unatural manner.
