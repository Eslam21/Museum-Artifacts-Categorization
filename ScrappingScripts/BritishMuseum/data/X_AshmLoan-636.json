", " Lemos places this sherd in Stage 2 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless.

Boardman suggests that the sherd might belong to the same vase as Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.97a.1894. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
