{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 33900", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP III/AMENOPHIS III/NEBMAATRE", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF AMENHOTEP III/KOM EL-HETAN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "1.15 cm", "Name": "Granite Statue of Amenhotep the Third", "Description": "This is one of the masterpieces of Egyptian sculpture. It is made of quartzite, which was a favorite material for the king as it was linked to the cult of Atum at Heliopolis. The statue shows Amenhotep the Third wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt with the uraeus, or royal cobra, above his forehead. He is wearing a short, beautifully decorated kilt with a uraeus garland in the center. His arms are by his sides and he is holding two scrolls. His left foot, wearing a sandal, steps forward. The face of the king was modeled with his characteristic features: a large band in relief bordering the upper eyelids, almond-shaped eyes, the short flat-based nose, a depression on either side of the mouth, the high outline of the lips, and high cheekbones. He also wears the long royal beard. The musculature of the legs and thighs is admirably sculptured. The back pillar supports the statue. The back pillar is in the form of a long, narrow round-topped stela, which is an upright stone or slab with an inscribed or sculptured surface. This stela is higher than the crown and narrower than the king's body, leaving the arms unsupported. The top of the stela is decorated with a winged solar disk over a scene showing a seated figure of the god Amun giving the symbols of power and long life to the king. Below, four columns of hieroglyphs list the name and titles of Amenhotep the Third. The name of Amun in this text was erased, perhaps in the time of Akhenaten, and not restored."}
