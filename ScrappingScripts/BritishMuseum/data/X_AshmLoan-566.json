", " According to Williams, the kylix is by the same painter as British Museum 1886,0401.1283, whom he has dubbed the Sirens Painter. The Laconian influences on this kylix are clear from from a number of features. The Laconian black-figured kylix (for instance, see British Museum 1888,0601.523 from Naukratis and 1854,0810.4 from Sicyon) is a well known vase shape which is not typically found in the Chian repertoire. The exterior decoration consisting of concentric bands, tongues and rising rays on the sherd are typical of Laconian kylixes. Finally, the pomegranate pattern around the tondo is the 'signature' pattern of the Laconian artist known as the Boread Painter. According to Lemos, there is also a horizontal handle palmette on the exterior of the kylix, but one is not visible, nor is it mentioned in any of the other publications. The handle palmette is another typical Laconian feature. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
