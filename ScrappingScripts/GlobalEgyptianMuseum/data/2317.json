{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1906:362", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF MENTUHOTEP NEBHEPETRE", "Category": "TILE", "Material": "GLAZE; POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; GLAZED", "Width": "7 cm", "Name": "Glazed tile fragment", "Description": "Fragment from a <!-->turquoise-blue glazed tile of faience, found in the temple to the cult of king Nebhepetra Mentuhotep, of the Middle Kingdom. The excavators dated this to the 18th Dynasty, about five hundred years later than the construction of the temple. Numerous votive offerings from the adjacent temples to the goddess Hathor appear to have been swept down into the Middle Kingdom precinct. Among these offerings, blue faience is a favourite material, perhaps evoking the theme of fertility central to the cult of the goddess."}
