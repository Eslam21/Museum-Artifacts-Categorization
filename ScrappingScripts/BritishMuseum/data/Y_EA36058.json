See a similar scene on a scarab and a scaraboid from Matmar (Brunton 1948, pl. LXIII, 118-119). Naukratis provided also a scaraboid with the same motif, BM 1886,0401.1685 (published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 136). This scarab belongs to a type which was produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions see Webb forthcoming) and was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype B1-17, but this piece is not listed).
