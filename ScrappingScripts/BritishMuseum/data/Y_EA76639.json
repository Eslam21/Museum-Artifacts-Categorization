Bonneau et al. Les Papyrus Leconte, Actes de XVe Congres international de papyrologie III (1979), 25-6; also P. Leconte I in RdE 30 (1978). P. Leconte is one of the unidentified fragments mentioned on ACP, p. 26. Devuchelle (pers. comm. 6.2000) notes that Leconte bought the papyri from R. Lambert who published a Lexique hieroglyphique chez Geuthner in 1925. Lambert had a military career; Devauchelle suggests that he may have bought the papyri before WWII 'quand il etait en exercice et interesse par l'Egypte.' Attached to this papyrus was a note from the dealers(?) which read: This is Leconte 6. At some point in its history it was claimed all the Leconte pieces were mounted by an expert, which is largely true, except for this piece which the expert put between two sheets of perspex, without any sort of hinges. The Leconte material has travelled around a good deal, most recently from Paris to London and by the time 4428 [this papyrus' lot number: written on back] arrived with us, many of the fragments had dispersed. The present arrangement, also between two sheets of perspex, was made under expert supervision, but may well be incorrect in places. There are traces of writing on the reverse, and every effort has been made to avoid these when placing hinges and small adhersive linking-strips, but the whole is even more fragile than usual.
