The body, wrapped in linen bandages, was covered with a thick layer of plaster; the face was modelled as a portrait. This method, however, was not adequate. The intestines soon started to rot. This head comes from Giza and is completely preserved. The oval face only depicts the essential details. The hairline is suggested by a carved line."}
