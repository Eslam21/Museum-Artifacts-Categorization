"], "Curator's comments": ["Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-5). This specimen is very close to BM 1888,0601.744.1, maybe from the same master/positive model. Scarabs produced using these moulds would be detailed and of high quality. The fine details visible inside the mould of the scarab impression shows that the clay has been forced into finely incised grooves in the original positive model. Gorton, A.
