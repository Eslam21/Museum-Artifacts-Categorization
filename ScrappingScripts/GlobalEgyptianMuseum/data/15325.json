{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 39873", "Dating": "RAMESSES II/USERMAATRE-SETEPENRE", "Archaeological Site": "TELL BASTA/BUBASTIS", "Category": "BRACELET", "Material": "GOLD; LAPIS LAZULI", "Technique": "INLAID", "Width": "6 cm", "Diameter": "7.2 cm", "Name": "Two Bracelets of Ramesses the Second", "Description": "A pair of rigid gold bracelets, each composed of two parts linked by a hinge. The fine decoration is executed by the granulation technique and consists mostly of geometric motifs. The bezel is composed of a goose, which has two heads turned backwards over the body, carved out of one piece of lapis lazuli. The fact that the cartouches of Ramesses the Second and the words for right and left are incised alongside the clasps of the bracelets, suggests that both of these bracelets were the actual ones worn by the king himself."}
