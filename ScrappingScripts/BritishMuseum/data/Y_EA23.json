In the 15th century Mamluk historian Ibn Iyas wrote that in the 900s, a mysterious basin made of \u201cdark stone and inscribed with the writing of birds\u201d magically floated across the Nile, transporting people inside of it like a ferry. Italian nobleman Pietro della Valle visited the basin in 1615, recording that it was then situated in the ruins of a palace near Cairo\u2019s Citadel. He wrote that local residents told him it was known as the Lovers\u2019 Fountain, because one could drink from it to \u201cbe relieved of the torments of love.\u201d It was later used as a ritual bath, and a \u2018plug-hole\u2019 has been drilled for this purpose at one end. Another tale suggested that jinn (spirits) held markets by the basin during the Islamic holy month of Muharram, and if a passer-by purchased food from them, he would find his purchase transformed into gold. Savants from Napoleon\u2019s Expedition to Egypt recorded the sarcophagus in 1798 and collected it with the aim of taking it to France. After the French surrender in 1801, the sarcophagus was given to the British, and it arrived at the British Museum in 1802. The Cairo neighborhood where the sarcophagus was located is still known as \u201cal-Houd al-Marsoud,\u201d Arabic for the Enchanted Basin. Published: Regulski, I. (ed.), 2022.
