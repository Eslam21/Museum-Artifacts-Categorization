", " On his third group of coin-weight dies al-Man\u1e63\u016br is not referred to by name but simply by the title Amir al-Mu'min\u012bn, Commander of the Faithful, used by all the Caliphs. Pieces in the series have occasionally been attributed to the succeeding Caliph al-Mahd\u012b but, as Miles (1958, 124) pointed out, since they are most often combined with the reverse of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd they must belong to the reign of al-Man\u1e63\u016br. Each denomination, d\u012bn\u0101r, half and third, is represented by a single die. The series belongs to the later part of al-Man\u1e63\u016br's reign, from the finance directorship of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd, the last part of it presumably, and probably the first part of the governorship of Ma\u1e6dar. For a long period in the middle of al-Man\u1e63\u016br's reign, approximately from the finance directorship of Nawfal b.Fur\u0101t to the early part of that of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd d\u012bn\u0101r and d\u012brham weights were issued in the name of the Governor or Finance Director without mention of the Caliph. Thus Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd has his own types of d\u012bn\u0101r-system weights, which usually occur with reverses in the names of executives and artisans, and presumably they were in use earlier than the obverse types of al-Man\u1e63\u016br with Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd's name on the reverse. Of the obverses, the illustrated specimens of the third-d\u012bn\u0101r one all have the same reverse of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd, with Mi\u1e63r, 'Egypt' or possibly 'Fustat', in the centre, as appears on the British Museum's half-d\u012bn\u0101r pieces (Miles 1948, 88; Fahmi 1957, 164; Miles 1958, 126; Balog 1976, 362-3. Cf. 361, 364). The d\u012bn\u0101r obverse also appears to have been found exclusively in combination with this reverse (Launois 1957, 209 = Fahmi, 1957, 163; Miles 1958, 124; Balog 1976, 358. Cf. Miles 1964, 30). Two specimens of the half-d\u012bn\u0101r die, however, have a different one (Miles 1948, 87; Balog 1976, 360). This second reverse die again has Mi\u1e63r in the centre but the marginal legend is of the executive Qutayba b. Ziy\u0101d. It is also found with a dinar obverse of Ma\u1e6dar, as on OA+ 4250, where the problems it raises are discussed at greater length. Since Qutayba was active with Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd as well as Ma\u1e6dar it is not certain that the reverse was only in use under the latter. Not all the illustrated specimens of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd's reverse are very clear. The star and dots, in particular, are invisible on many of the photographs, even in some cases where their presence is indicated by the commentators. However, so far as can be judged, only one die has been employed. No other reverse type of Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sa\u02bf\u012bd is known.
