", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This amulet might come from such a context. Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and at Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. Nefertum is relatively well represented in small amuletic figures from Naukratis, may they be in copper alloy, stone or glazed composition like for this specimen (Masson forthcoming b). During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217).
