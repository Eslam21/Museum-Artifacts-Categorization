Bartrum, 'German Renaissance Prints', exh. cat. BM 1995, no. 195. Text from Bartrum 1995 Literature: Bartsch, 5; Hollstein, 5; Winzinger, 129 This print displays Altdorfer's engraving technique and style in its accomplished maturity. He has transposed a religious theme to an entirely Germanic setting in which landscape plays a fundamental part. Despite the print's small size, an impressive sense of distance and atmosphere is achieved. The figures of Joseph and Mary in contemporary dress are placed firmly in the foreground at the lower edge of the image. The use of deeply engraved lines here is gradually replaced with fewer, lighter burin strokes for the church and buildings in the middle distance, and fewer still for the alpine peaks in the background. The composition successfully draws the eye away from the figures towards the horizon, where the effect of sun glistening on snow and ice on the mountains is achieved with considerable virtuosity."], "Bibliographic references": [" New Hollstein (German) / The New Hollstein: German engravings, etchings and woodcuts 1400-1700 (e.5) (Altdorfer) ", " Bartsch / Le Peintre graveur (VIII.43.5) ", " Bartrum 1995 / German Renaissance Prints 1490-1550 (195) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 1995 Jun-Oct, BM, 'German Renaissance Prints, 1490-1550', no.195 "], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Virgin Mary ", " Representation of: St Joseph ", " Representation of: Jesus Christ "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: W & G Smith"], "Acquisition date": ["1845"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1845,0809.1140"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 01 Feb 1995"]}
