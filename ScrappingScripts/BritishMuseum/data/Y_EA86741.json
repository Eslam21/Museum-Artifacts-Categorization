The rear shows two sides with each one basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front shows a small oval scarab-like seal-impression. The motif shows a circumferential line, inside a kneeling figure, facing to the left, in front of it a vertical cartouche with a kheper as lowest sign. The impression is not very clear. Finger impressions under the seal-impression.
