{"artifact_name": "amphora; stopper; seal-impression; plug", "Object Type": [" amphora ", " stopper ", " seal-impression ", " plug "], "Museum number": ["EA53955"], "Description": [" Hard, white, lime-based plaster wine-amphora stopper with pottery disc plug still inside the neck of a North African amphora. The plaster stopper has been impressed with a circular stamp and then painted red (only faint traces remain). The stamp impression is unclear, but appears to be Greek text, perhaps including the letters \u039d\u0395. The palm fibre used as a valve is still present in the fermentation hole. The plug is made from a wheel-made jar or amphora made of a red fabric, probably the same as the neck in which the stopper was placed. On neck of amphora is a Greek vessel notation.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1 & 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1 & 7). For a similar vessels with notations found at Antinoupolis and dating to the second half of the 5th century AD, with discussion and bibliography on the acronym and formulae, see Fournet and Pieri 2008, no. 1 and pp. 180\u201382. The amphora neck is of a small Late Roman North African Spatheion-type made across coastal Libya and Tunisia between the end of the 4th and the mid-5th century AD (Keay and Williams 2005, Spatheion Type 1C). This type of amphora was commonly used to transport olives, wine and fish sauce. The black sealant on the underside of the plug is probably pine pitch,indicating it was a wine amphora (Thomas 2011, type 1 with bibliography; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Fournet, J.-L. and D.
