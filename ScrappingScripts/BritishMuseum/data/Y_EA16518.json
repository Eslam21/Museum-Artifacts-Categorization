The fine workmanship and the material used suggest that it belonged to a piece of elite, perhaps royal, furniture, such as a chair.

It possessed many different associations, particularly with royalty, and use of the symbol meant that the dangerous power of the cobra was always magically turned to the benefit of the user. Thus the king's uraeus, worn on his brow, is referred to in some battle texts as destroying his enemies and giving the king power over them. Images of Egyptian gods also bear the rearing cobra. This cobra could be interpreted as either Hathor who, in the guise of the eye of Ra, was sent to destroy mankind for being disrespectful, or as Sekhmet who was the fiery weapon of the god Ra and who could also be sent out to destroy the enemies of the gods. Ra bequeathed this gift of potential destruction, represented by the rearing cobra, to his descendants, the kings of Egypt.The rearing cobra also represents the goddess Wadjet, patron of the town of Buto. She and the vulture goddess Nekhbet, of el-Kab, represented Lower and Upper Egypt respectively and were shown wearing the appropriate red and white crowns. Together they were the tutelary goddesses of the third name of the king, the so-called \"two ladies\" name, placing him under their protection. Hence the uraeus represents both Wadjet and the power immanent in the cobra. Bibliography: 'Gold and Civilisation' Catalogue (Australia, 2001), p.117; S. Quirke and J.
