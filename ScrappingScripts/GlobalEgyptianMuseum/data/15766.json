The capital, or top of the column, consists of nine wide palms. From the bottom to the middle, the container is painted with alternating yellow and white wavy designs. Below the capital, there are two lines painted yellow and another two painted white. The bases of the palms are painted yellow. Glass with such decorative patterns was not blown when it was made. It was molded around a clay core, which was then removed when the glass cooled. To obtain the garland and wavy decorations, the artisan applied little rods of yellow, white, and blue glass to the smooth, reheated surface of the container."}
