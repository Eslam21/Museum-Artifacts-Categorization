An upper part broken from a figure of a woman celebrant, probably standing. Her hair is parted in the middle and she wears a tightly woven and bound wreath, with more of her headdress above broken away. The strap of her chiton has slipped off her left shoulder, and she holds and plays a triangular harp placed high on her right side. The back of the figure is lost. Hollow; two-piece mould.
