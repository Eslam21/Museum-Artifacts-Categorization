{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1894:635.7", "Dating": "2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Width": "1.1 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Steatite scarab with detailed cutting of head and legs, but not of wing-cases on the back. This style is typical of 2nd Intermediate Period scarabs, as is the cutting of the motif on the underside, showing a scarab beetle with sun-disk between the front legs. The movement of the sun through the sky was paralleled by the scarab pushing its eggs in a ball of dung along the ground; the hatching of the eggs from the ball provided an analogy with the daily rebirth of the sun on the eastern horizon at dawn."}
