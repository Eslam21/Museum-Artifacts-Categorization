XVIII, no. 70). Padibastet (Petoubastis) is a royal name for three pharaohs between the 23rd and 26th dynasty, as well as a common private name during the Late Period (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 283). This name is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Gorton 1996, 93, 103-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B16-23; on the various productions from this factory, see Webb forthcoming). Some were discovered in Naukratis itself such as: Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.13; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.858; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.926. This specimen, however, is made out of stone and could have been produced elsewhere in Egypt. Various parallels: Fraser 1900, pl.
