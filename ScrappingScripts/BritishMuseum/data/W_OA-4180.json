However it is clear that the text resembles that of a fals weight and refers to \u02bfUbayd\u0101ll\u0101h, whose father's unusual name is reasonably plain. Its weight is perfect for 20 kharr\u016bba but one wonders whether it was an official issue. A few types with similar garbled legends are known for other governors, for instance what appears to be a comparable fals weight of \u1e24ayy\u0101n b. Shuray\u1e25, with the legend partly in reverse, was published by Casanova (1893, 30) and a rather more legible type of al-Q\u0101sim b. \u02bfUbayd\u0101ll\u0101h is represented in the British Museum's collection (OA+ 4226). This latter, though incompetently written, is clearly copied from al-Q\u0101sim\u2019s ordinary fals-al-kab\u012br weights (e.g. Nos OA+ 4320, OA+ 4321 and 1889,0604.68). There is no obvious model for the present piece which has little in common with \u02bfUbayd\u0101ll\u0101h 's 20- kharr\u016bba weights, such as 1891,1003.27. In general the types with garbled legends do not share any great family resemblance. Bibliography: Casanova, P. 1893.
