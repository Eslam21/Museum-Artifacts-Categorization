It contains faience shabti of the same date and probably therefore original to the burial.This is one of the antiquities acquired by Lady Harriet Kavanagh, a remarkable traveller to Egypt in the 1840s. Her collection of over three hundred items forms an important part of the National Museum's Egyptian holdings. Thanks to her diaries, in the possession of the family, this is a well-documented example of European travel to Egypt before the establishment of archaeological recording in the late nineteenth century."}
