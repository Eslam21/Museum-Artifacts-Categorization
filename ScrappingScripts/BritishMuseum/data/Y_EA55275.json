They are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. They occur for example at Bubastis, Tanis, Zagazig, Sais, Saqqara and Memphis (Wallert 1967, 53). As demonstrated by J. Bult\u00e9, the general theme displayed on offering spoons is often associated with the act of offering or with the offering itself (Bult\u00e9 2008). This specimen belongs to a common type representing bound cattle. This type was manufactured in various materials, in stone (slate or schist), in bone or ivory, in glazed composition or blue Egyptian (Bult\u00e9 2008, 9, pl. VI). A fragmentary similar example, BM 1888,0601.72, was already published for Naukratis (Gardner 1888, 87, Pl. XIX, no. 8). It is an archaizing copy of a New Kingdom model, that can be dated to the 26th or, latest, early 27th dynasty. Masson, A. forthcoming, \u2018Naukratis: Egyptian offerings in context\u2019, in M.
