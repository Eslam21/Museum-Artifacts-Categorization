{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 31199", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TUNA EL-GABAL", "Category": "PAPYRUS", "Material": "PAPYRUS", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Height": "13 cm", "Name": "Papyrus with Satirical Drawings", "Description": "Judging from their rich artistic and literary tradition, not only did Egyptians enjoy life, but they also poked fun at it. This scene, which is depicted on papyrus, shows a complete reversal of roles. Acting in a human capacity, an elegantly dressed lady mouse is served by four cats and foxes are shown serving a cow. The lady mouse is shown seated on a stool, drinking from a cup, which she received from a cat standing in front of her. Behind the mouse, there is another cat arranging her hair. Next in the procession, comes a nurse cat tenderly carrying the swaddled baby mouse, which is being protected from the sun by a large fan carried by another cat. In the other direction, we see a fox carrying a jar on a shoulder pole as another fox pours from a second jug into a basin. Beside them, their cow mistress looks on. One could translate these acts into words: \"the guard is himself the thief\" or \"the time has come when the lowly became the masters.\""}
