Both surfaces were heavily burnished, a treatment that left strong horizontal markings on the inner surface. The burnish of the outer surface, which is neater, was applied over a a punctated \"dents de loup\" design (\"wolf's teeth\" motif) that is only visible in certain areas. It is likely that this preliminary decoration was made in order to enhance a rippled effect which was eventually not achieved by the craftsman."}
