A 40). The pose of the figure is based on that of the soldier on the right of 'Joshua and the Israelites crossing the Jordan' by Raphael and his workshop in the tenth bay of the Vatican Logge. Sonja Brink rejects the traditional attribution to Muziano in favour of tentatively assigning it to Biagio Pupini. As the BM drawing does not look particularly like the Bolognese artist, the question of authorship remains open. Lit.: J.A. Gere and P.

The attribution to Siciolante, made when the drawing entered the collection, is based on the drapery system and on the technique. It shows him in an unusually Michelangelesque phase, though the immediate source of inspiration seems to have been Tibaldi rather than Michelangelo himself.
