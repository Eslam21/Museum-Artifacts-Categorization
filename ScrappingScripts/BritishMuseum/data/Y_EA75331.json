M, N, and \u0460 are wide, and sometimes also H, K, \u03a0, and X. Provenance: this text was issued from the 'Ma' of Apa Jeremias to monks of the Monastery of Apa Apollo. The acquisition details suggest a Hermopolite context. The place name mentioned in l. 7 may be Percie in the Hermopolite nome or Perciese in the Faiyum. This document is very fragmentary, but it may be related to other tithe collection texts from the same collection. Fathers of the 'diakonia' of the 'Ma' of Apa Jeremias address two monks belonging to the Monastery of Apa Apollo, to whom they may have assigned a place called Percie or Perciese (l. 7). Percie, which is possibly the more likely interpretation here, may be identified with el-Burgaya, about 6.5 km north of el-Minya in the Hermopolite nome (Timm, S.
