This exemplar belongs to a type of mallet with pearshaped head (see also E.1952, E.4414, and E.4416), which was used for heavy work, notably in the quarries, for the preliminary treatment of stones and for the cutting of smooth surfaces. In the middle part of its head, one can see clearly traces of wear caused by the chisels at the time of striking."}
