The sherd probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965, 0930.338. Lemos identifies this sherd as coming from a phiale. She does discuss other sherds from the same heavy chalice and describes them as coming from a mediocre but big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are therefore known as heavy chalices; they display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1).
