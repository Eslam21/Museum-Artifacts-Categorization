{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["EA64126"], "Description": [" Fragment of a gold-glass bowl: fragment of a thin and shallow bowl. Apparently made in an open or press-mould by assembling rods which were fused together. Rods in various shades of blue and white. One rod of transparent colourless glass has tiny groups of gold-leaf fragments, three in each group and made in the sandwich technique. Similar rods doubtless existed in the missing areas. Impressed into the inner surface of the bowl is a bull's eye with an outer band of aquamarine-blue, then a ring of dark blue and, at centre, an opaque white disc. This does not go through to the under-surface. Opaque white bands were also impressed. These do penetrate to the under-surface.
