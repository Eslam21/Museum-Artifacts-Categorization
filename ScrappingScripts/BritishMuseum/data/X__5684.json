", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This amulet might come from such a context. Taweret is well represented in the faience amulets from Naukratis (Masson forthcoming a). Associated with the protection of pregnancy and child birth (Andrews 1994, 40; Herrmann et al. 2010, 80-82), Taweret amulets are already documented in the Old Kingdom (Ferrari 1996, 40) and are particularly common in Egyptian settlements of the Late and Ptolemaic Periods (for example: Giddy 1992, pl. 52, 78/1, pl. 53, 78/85, pl. 77, 78/1, 78/85; Wilson 1982, 30, pl.
