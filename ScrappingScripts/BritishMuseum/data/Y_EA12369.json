{"artifact_name": "tile", "Object Type": ["tile"], "Museum number": ["EA12369"], "Description": [" Rectangular glazed composition tile with coloured inlay in the form of a cartouche of Ramses III. Most of the inlays into the yellow glazed tile are in blue glazed composition, apart from two sections in red, and the face of Maat in white. On top of some of the sections of the cartouche itself, inlays of dark blue glass have been adhered over the blue glazed composition. The dots in the hieroglyphic signs for \u2018Two Lands\u2019 at the top of the tile are inlaid with shell. Most of all the inlays have been damaged somewhat or lost, and the tile itself is chipped and broken off at the top and in the right hand corner.

This suggests that the tile may have featured as decoration on a palace door frame. Tile inlays often featured on the door frames, columns, cavetto cornices, and throne pedestals of New Kingdom palaces and temples, set into recesses in the stone and mud brick (Arnold 2003, 20-1). This tile was found in the remains of the palace of Ramses III at Tell el-Yahudiya, along with other decorative tiles featuring rosettes, foreign captives, rekhyt-birds on nb-baskets, and floral friezes of lotus flowers and grapes. Petrie\u2019s later excavations at the site uncovered the additions to the town made by Ramses III, including a thick mud brick enclosure wall and a palace. The remains of the palace included a large red granite column base, calcite pavement blocks, and remnants of glazed tiles, as well as calcite decorative inlays featuring the cartouche of Ramses III and fragments depicting human and leonine elements (Petrie 1906, 8, 17, pl. 16A). The tile is made of a glazed composition, also known as faience. The body of the tile was likely shaped with a mould, and the inlays may have been added by applying the paste freehand or using a shallow mould. Bibliography: D.
