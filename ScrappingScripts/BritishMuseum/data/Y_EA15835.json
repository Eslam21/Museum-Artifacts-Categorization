{"artifact_name": "plaque", "Object Type": ["plaque"], "Museum number": ["EA15835"], "Description": [" Fragment of gold glass: transparent colourless glass, flat and composed of two layers fused together. Between the two layers, doubtless on the upper surface of the under-sheet, is a conventionalized vine design built up from short, rectangular lengths of gold leaf. Probably the layer with the decorations was reheated until a slightly viscous state was reached so as to make the decorations adhere. Probably the border of a decorative plaque.
