The spool and disc were thrown in one piece and the inner face of the disc was added separately. There are many fingerprints on the inside. The outside is smoothed with some scuffing in the canalis of the volute. Miltos in the canalis. For parallels, see British Museum 1888,0601.601.b, which is probably not from the same krater."], "Bibliographic references": [" Johnston 1978 / Pottery from Naukratis: An Exhibition on the Occasion of the 11th International Congress of Classical Archaeology (no. 39) ", " M\u00f6ller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece (p. 237, no. 21) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GA.0184) (Phase 1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.601.a"]}
