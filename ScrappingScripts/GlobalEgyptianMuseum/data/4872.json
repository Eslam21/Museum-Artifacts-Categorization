The head is marked by two parallel curved and carved lines, the eyes are bored, and the fins are covered with fine carved lines. The body of this piece is hollowed out from head to tail. The head has an opening at the mouth where originally a handle made of calcite could be fitted. A very finely veined calcite has been used, the pattern of which nicely imitates the scales. The fish that stood model for this dish is the tilapia. It is common throughout Egypt and was used for food, as is shown in many reliefs and paintings."}
