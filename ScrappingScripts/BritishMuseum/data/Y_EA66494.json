XXXVII, no. 103; on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). The cross-shaped sign and small circles, which are associated with the name of Amun, are typical of Naukratis scarabs (see especially Gorton 1996, Type XXVIII C, 105-106). However, the scarab does not fit perfectly Gorton's type XXVIII by its rather large size and the technique used (incision rather than stamp).
