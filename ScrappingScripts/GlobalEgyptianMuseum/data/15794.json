These models give us a clear idea of the different kinds and forms of boats used in ancient Egypt. They show masts, sails, steering paddles and single or double storied cabins, decorated with colored geometric motifs. Some have stairs; others are provided with kiosks for the lookouts. Some were made for the transportation of the sun god. One of the models exhibited here is an imitation of the papyrus canoe that was usually used for sailing or fishing in the canals of the Delta marshes."}
