{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 71038", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF ASWAN", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "52 cm", "Name": "Jar with Handles and Greek Inscriptions", "Description": "This tall storage jar has a wide neck, flared lip, and rounded base. It has two small handles from below the lip to the shoulder. The body of this jar is undecorated, except at the shoulder where a short Greek text is written in red, perhaps to identify the contents of the jar. The body is obviously wheel-made but the roughness and the polish of the handles suggest that they are hand-made."}
