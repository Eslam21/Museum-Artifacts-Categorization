{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7534", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS ?", "Category": "NECKLACE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED; FAYENCE", "Width": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Collar", "Description": "This object, part of the private collection of Howard Carter, is very similar to collars found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The centerpiece is an almost round piece of polychrome faience, made from two floral elements each repeated in a row and held in place by a triangular clip decorated with a half-open lotus flower. The first element looks like a slightly pointed yellow fruit (a mandrake?) coming out of a blue chalice. The second element is a petal of a blue lotus, coloured yellow at the bottom and blue at the opposite end. The beads of the inside row are brown, those of the middle yellow, and those of the outer row blue and green. This progression of colour gives the collar an unusual and delicate appearance."}
