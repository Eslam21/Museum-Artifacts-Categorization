Red pigment survives along the torus sides and upper part of the un-decorated edges. The torus encloses an offering scene with 1 full and 2 short horizontal lines (Inscription A), and 4 vertical lines (Inscriptions B-C), above, and 2 horizontal lines (Inscription D) below, of incised hieroglyphic inscription with traces of blue pigment. The bottom line is of markedly inferior quality to the previous. The main figure of the offering scene, on the left, is of the owner seated on a lion-legged chair, with one hand extended along the leg, the other holding a fan   to the chest; to his right are seated on the ground two women, one on smaller scale, each with long wig and one hand extended along leg, the other held to the chest. At the level of the man's upper body is marked a base-line for a pile of offerings consisting of an elon-gated form, round loaf, two sealed vessels and goose. The offerings and the figures of the owner and smaller-scale woman retain traces of blue pigment."}
