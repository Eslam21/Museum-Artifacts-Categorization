{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2244", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "19 cm", "Name": "Lute player", "Description": "This small decorative plaque of bronze probably embellished a column of one of the Theban temples; it was brought back from Egypt by Jean Looze, a participant in the Napoleonic Expedition of 1798. It depicts a lute player standing on a papyrus skiff. This scene is well known from painted walls of tombs and toilette objects and can even be found in the form of an amulet. This object dates from the reign of Tutankhamun and the style shows the influence of Amarna art: the pose of the body of the player, wrapped in a pleated garment and with a prominent belly, is very characteristic of the age of Akhenaten."}
