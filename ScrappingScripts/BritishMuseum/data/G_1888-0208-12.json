{"artifact_name": "situla", "Object Type": ["situla"], "Museum number": ["1888,0208.12"], "Description": [" Reconstructed sherds of neck of black figure painted pottery situla. A, two confronted sphinxes, a volute tree between them; B, flying eagle (or falcon) and standing partridge, in field rosette of ring and dots: below, lotus flowers and palmettes. On A, the paint has worn badly, but there are traces of purple on the faces and chest of the sphinxes, on the band along the wing at the base of the feathers, and for dots in loops and corners of the volute tree; on B, purple on alternate feathers of eagle and the band at their base, following incised lines on breast of partridge, for alternate dots of rosette.

Along the upper edge of the lower wing of the eagle the line which cuts across the claw is a break, and so is the downward mark below that wing: the BMC is mistaken in seeing an eagle on top of another bird. For partridges see H. G. G. Payne, Necrocorinthia, 174 n. 1 and also BSA xxxiv, 64-65. Domesticated partridges (as apparently on the relief Istanbul 578 - M. Schede, Meisterzverke der t\u00fcrkischen Museen i, pl. 5) were seen by William Lithgow in the Cyclades in the early seventeenth century (Rare Adventures, Travellers' Library edition, 68). The partridge is rare in black figure technique: there is a good reason, that the barring does not show up."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B106.10) ", " CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (Pl.
