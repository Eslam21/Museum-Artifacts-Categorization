{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA171"], "Description": [" Statue of Ankhwa: a red granite statue of an official, shown seated upon a cubical stool with hollowed sides and back. He holds an adze in the left hand; the right hand rests, palm downwards, on the lap. The figure wears a short kilt and a full wig, upon which the details of the curls are indicated. The face is full and heavy, but skilfully carved. The broad mouth, with its rounded corners, dominates the frontal view of the face. The crisp carving of the lips contrasts with the modeling of the eyes, which lack any indication of the lower lids. On the kilt above the left knee is a vertical line of inscription in low relief. The striations of Ankhwa's flaring coiffure undulate near the crown of his head; two ridges at the lower ends suggest crimping. The boat-hieroglyph has an animal head at the prow, possibly that of a bull.

Landstr\u00f6m, 'Ships of the pharaohs: 4000 years of Egyptian shipbuilding ' (London, 1970), 16-18; also the boats on the knife-handle from Gebel el-Arak, in H. Asselberghs, 'Chaos en Beheersing: documenten uit aeneolithisch Egypte' (Leiden, 1961), pl.XLI, fig. 58. The inscribed name has previously been read 'pr-'n\u1e2bw (P. Kaplony, 'Die Inschriften der \u00c4gyptischen Fr\u00fchzeit I (Wiesbaden, 1946), 446, with references). Steindorff, in 'Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzieger', 1893, 65, gave the name as Ankhwa, but without comment on the hieroglyphs. For the title, see also N. de G. Davies, 'The rock tombs of Sheikh Sa\u00efd ' (London, 1901), 33. B\u1e0fms has been regarded as the name of the person depicted, but the reason for the signs being outside the main text has not been explained. Kaplony suggests that Bedjmes was the name of the father of Ankhwa, quoting a statue in Cairo as evidence (P. Kaplony, 'Die Inschriften der \u00c4gyptischen Fr\u00fchzeit I (Wiesbaden, 1946), 446-7, 506, 594; see also L. Borchardt, 'Statuen und Statuetten von K\u00f6nigen und Privatleuten (Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des antiquit\u00e9s du Mus\u00e9e du Caire)' I (Cairo, 1911), no. 1). Whilst it is true that the Cairo statue bears two names, there is no real evidence that one refers to the father of the person depicted. Another possibility is that both names belong to the same man. There are examples from the Third Dynasty of inscriptions giving both a [rn\u2018\u0292] and a [rn n\u1e0fs]. In the case of the British Museum statue, Ankhwa would be the great name since it follows the titles, whilst Bedjmes would be the lesser name (cf. the names of Khabawsokar, in A. Mariette, 'Les Mastabas de l'Ancien Empire' (Paris 1889), 74-5. In support of this suggestion, an Old Kingdom statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art may be quoted, which bears two names of a single person. It is interesting to note that the second name has been carved in small hieroglyphs, just like the name Bedjmes on the statue of Ankhwa; see H. G. Fischer,' Ancient Egypt in the Metropolitan Museum Journal vols. 1-11' (1968-1976), 80 and fig. 12. Kaplony reads the name Bedjmes as [B\u1e0fh] taking the ms-sign, the three fox tails hieroglyph, as a determinative (P. Kaplony, 'Die Inschriften der \u00c4gyptischen Fr\u00fchzeit I (Wiesbaden, 1946), 475-6), but this hieroglyph later occurs in various forms in its normal reading, as, for example, on the stela of Tjetji (British Museum 614), where it takes a slightly different form) This same sign on the statue has also been taken as a variant form of nbw, the hieroglyph resemling a gold collar, and the group read as a title: [b\u1e0f.tl nbw]; see R. Drenkhahn, 'Die Handwerker und ihre T\u00e4tigkeiten im Alten \u00c4gypten' (Wiesbaden, 1976), 39-40. Bibliography (selective): B. Porter & R.
