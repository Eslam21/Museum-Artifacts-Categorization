{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6808", "Dating": "OLD KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "10.5 cm", "Width": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a dwarf", "Description": "This small statuette in limestone represents a dwarf, standing on a socle, carrying a canine on his arms. The head of the person is too large for the body and juts out towards the front. The limbs are thick and the legs are half-bent. The interpretation of the statuette and of several examples representing the same theme is not evident. Recent studies stress the presence of the canine symbolising the Sothis star, herald of the first day of the inundation. The statuettes would then have signified  rebirth in a funerary context."}
