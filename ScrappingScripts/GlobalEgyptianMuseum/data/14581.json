{"Present location": "BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA ANTIQUETIES MUSEUM [01/027] ALEXANDRIA BAAM", "Inventory number": "10", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "PART OF LAMP", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "TECHNIQUE OF CERAMICS", "Name": "Oil Lamp Representing Beset", "Description": "A fragment of an oil lamp, made of clay, is in the form of Beset, the spouse of the god Bes, lying down and holding a tambourine in her hand. Her hair is hanging on her shoulders and round her back in locks, and she has a feather-like crown on her head. It is noticeable that oil lamps had started to progress; artists did not just stop at geometrical and floral decorations, but rather started to use a new style, and to design the figure of a god or goddess to give a more aesthetic appearance to the lamp."}
