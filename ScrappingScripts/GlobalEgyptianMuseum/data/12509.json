{"Present location": "ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM [06/002] AMSTERDAM", "Inventory number": "APM 7780", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "MARBLE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "73 cm", "Width": "21.5 cm", "Depth": "18.5 cm", "Name": "Statue of a king", "Description": "The statue represents a striding king, the left leg is put forward. The arms hang down beside the body, the hands hold the remains of some object, perhaps a staff. The statue has a back pillar. The stone between the legs has not been removed and is connected with the lower part of the back pillar. The king is shown in a rather stiff, conventional attitude. He wears only a short kilt with a belt and the nemes-head cloth with the uraeus. The various parts of the body are well-proportioned, in contrast with the head which is rather heavy and lacks individuality. The rendering of the body and the face has been influenced by Graeco-Roman examples, which is typical of the Ptolemaic Period."}
