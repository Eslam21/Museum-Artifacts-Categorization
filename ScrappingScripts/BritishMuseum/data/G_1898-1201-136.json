Two small vertical ribbon-handles at top of body; neck missing and most of one handle. Extensive strain-cracks on lower body. Body clear dark blue with opaque white, opaque light blue and opaque orange trails; handle(s?) clear dark blue with opaque light blue and opaque orange trails. Whitish enamel-like coating all over, almost completely obscuring the colours. At bottom of neck traces of zigzag orange neck-trail; at junction of shoulder and body, horizontal light blue trail; on body feather pattern of three mingled colours and, below this, another light blue trail. On handle(s ?), vertically, an orange trail bounded on each side by a light blue one. Core-formed and tooled; trails on neck and body drawn on, marvered and combed, those on handles in sunken relief.
