According to the inscription, this drawing records a painting made by Claude in 1641 for a Mr Tardif that is now unknown. This is somewhat regrettable given that it is Claude\u2019s only known depiction of this episode from Ovid. It is also one of two paintings that Claude made for this patron, who remains unknown, the other being the Flight into Egypt (for which see 1957,1214.66) which is also unknown. It appears however that both paintings were quite small and were presumably quite small. The handling is light, and spiritied, with the pink heightening lending a more painterly character to the drawing than a majority of the drawing in the Liber (for more on the Liber see 1957,1214.6).
