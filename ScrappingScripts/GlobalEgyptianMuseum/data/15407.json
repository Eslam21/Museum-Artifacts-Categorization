{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 92591", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "AIN SHAMS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "73 cm", "Width": "32.2 cm", "Name": "Statue of Osiris and Isis", "Description": "Osiris is wearing a partly broken Atef crown, a uraeus, and a royal beard, which is attached directly to the statue. He is holding the flail and crook, the symbols of dignity and sovereignty. He is depicted in mummiform with only his hands exposed. Isis sits beside him wearing a three-part wig decorated with a sun disk between two cow horns, and a uraeus. She wears a long tight tunic that reaches to her ankles. Her left hand rests flat on her knee and her right open palm is placed on Osiris's right shoulder. Each side of the throne has the traditional offering, varying in length, invoking Isis the \"Great God's Mother\" and Osiris the \"Great God,\" on behalf of Pa-lyrew. This suggests that the work was intended to be a votive offering on its owner's behalf."}
