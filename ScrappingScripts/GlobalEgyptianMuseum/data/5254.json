{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "64", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "OUTSIDE EGYPT", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "49.5 cm", "Width": "19.5 cm", "Depth": "31 cm", "Name": "Sistophorous pseudo-block statue of Khai-hapi", "Description": "The sculpture depicts a man squatting upon a round cushion, with his folded arms resting on his knees and on a sistrum of Hathor. The sistrum displays the face of the goddess with the cow's ears. The man is wearing a wig consisting of a multitude of small curls and a small beard, both of which have been rendered in a stylized form. Of his garments only a knee-length pleated kilt may be discerned, as well as sandals. In his right hand, the man is holding the so-called djed-pillar, the hieroglyph for 'duration'. His left hand may have held the sign for 'life', the loop-handled cross. The broad, flat face must be an idealized depiction, as we cannot imagine this to be a portrait. The proportions of the body are excellent. The upper arms are distinct and the curve of the back displays a harmonious line. Fortunately, damage to the statue is only slight - the nose and the left elbow have suffered damage and the right upper arm and the left hand which was attached to it are missing entirely. The missing elements of the inscriptions can easily be restored with certainty."}
