{"artifact_name": "axe; ornament", "Object Type": [" axe ", " ornament "], "Museum number": ["EA57375"], "Description": [" Flat, thin ornamental axe-head: of arsenical copper. It is deeply rounded in form. Conventional binding-holes are lacking. It bears a crude openwork decoration in the form of two symmetrical figures of the deity Ipi or Ipet, which stand on an uneven base facing one another, with mouths agape and forelegs extended. They are separated by a central bar, which expands at the top and is possibly meant to represent a lotus or papyrus plant. The decoration is quite flat and there is no internal detail. The blade has been cleaned of corrosion product. There is light pitting all over. The tail of one of the figures is cracked through and its forward hind-leg is barely connected to the matrix. The cutting edge is shaped but was never fully sharpened and bears no signs of wear. "], "Cultures/periods": [" First Intermediate (?) ", " 11th Dynasty (?)
