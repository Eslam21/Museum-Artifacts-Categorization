This piece belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-103, 106-107, Type XXVIII A, subtype A116-117, but see A114 for this piece wrongly identified as a Bes head scaraboid). The features of the Black African head compare with moulds found in the Factory, of which Petrie only illustrated four types (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 8-11, see especially type 9 for this piece).
