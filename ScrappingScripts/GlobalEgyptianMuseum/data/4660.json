{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "151", "Dating": "13TH DYNASTY (not before); 2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; ENGRAVED", "Height": "24 cm", "Width": "16.4 cm", "Depth": "3.4 cm", "Name": "Stela of Wah-Ka", "Description": "Tall rectangular stela with rounded top. The section containing the representations is framed by a simple incised line, except at the bottom where there is a double line. On each side is a simply demarcated column of text, open at the top. The lines and registers are generally separated by a simple line. Scenes and texts have been worked into the stone rather roughly. In some of the representations, the inner surfaces have been cut away but otherwise there is no inner detail except for an eye (?) of the woman on the right. The hieroglyphs at the top are large and clear in comparison to the rest, which have been hastily executed. The stela is of a very poor workmanship."}
