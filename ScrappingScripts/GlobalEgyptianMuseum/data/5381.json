The body is leaning against an inscribed flat back pillar. The small face is framed by a smooth shoulder-length wig. The man is wearing a smooth short kilt. Unlike the arms, the upper body gives the impression of power. The large hands are holding a naos containing a badly damaged figure of Osiris that is partly worked in the round. The crossed arms and fists have been well modelled, as have the flagellum (nekhakha-sceptre) in the right hand and the crook (heqa-sceptre) in the left."}
