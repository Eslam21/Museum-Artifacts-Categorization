On the left two women are grinding flour, a bread oven is next to them. A woman originally kneeling beside the oven is now lost. In the centre a man is cutting the throat of an ox with a flint knife; the legs of the ox are bound together and the man kneels with one hand pressing the head to the floor. To the right another man is pressing barley bread through a sieve into a vat where it will ferment when mixed with water and date juice. Beside him are other vats and sealed beer jars, two with net coverings. Models like this one, showing butchery, are from the tombs of nobles, the only Egyptians to eat meat regularly."}
