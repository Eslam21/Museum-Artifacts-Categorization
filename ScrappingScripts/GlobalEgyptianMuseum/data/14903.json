At the time of the New Kingdom, tombs for the kings were hewn in the rock at Thebes, where a natural mound in the shape of a pyramid dominated the area. Rock-cut tombs of the officials, however, had courts and cult shrines of brick, sometimes topped by a small limestone pyramidion. This pyramidion came from the Theban tomb of the Army Officer and Chief of the Archers, Ry and his wife May. It is decorated on one side only by figures of the deceased and his wife kneeling and raising their arms in adoration to the rising sun. The vertical column of hieroglyphs reads as follows: \"Praying to the sun god Re when he rises in the Eastern Horizon of the sky.\" The horizontal line of text gives the names and titles of Ry and May. It is evident that Ry was not the original owner of the pyramidion and he may have usurped it, and ordered that only one side should be decorated after the decorations on the other three sides had been effaced."}
