The first and most important register shows Montuhotep sitting in a chair with lion legs, before a large table of offerings. Under the table are two large wine jars, one of which is still sealed. A drinking cup is beside him on a tall stand. The composition of the next two registers is similar but every element is approximately half the size.

Kemku, being presented with offerings by the priest. The carving is of an extremely high standard and shows excellent detail."}
