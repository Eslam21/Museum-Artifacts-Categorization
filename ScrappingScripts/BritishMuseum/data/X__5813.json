This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The waster (?) was analysed by proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE) under a 3 MeV energy proton beam for characterisation of the elemental chemical composition (major, minor and trace elements), in March 2014, by the Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Mus\u00e9es de France (C2RMF). If the identification of waster correct, this would be another indication for the production of glazed composition/egyptian-style amulets at Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). Three relatively similar amulets of a double-sided Bes were discovered in Naukratis: Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology E140; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,69; Greenock, McLean Museum & Art Gallery 1987.451. The latter is said to come from the Scarab Factory. Their style looks however a bit more schematic than the double-sided Bes waster. According to the register, it would not a waster but the \"head of a small figure reposing on a head-rest with faces of Bes on it\".
