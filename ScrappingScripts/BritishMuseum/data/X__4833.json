{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Archaizing head, from a figure of a boy or woman with black painted hair in band. Likely a devotee/worshipper. The fragment shows a head with a plump, round face and two 'Venus-rings' on the neck. The eyes are large and prominently outlined. The hair is parted over the brow and tightly rolled under at the back of the neck. A single lock hangs down in front behind each ear. The texture of the hair is indicated by a series of small, curving nicks. A heavy band encircles the head. Moderately compact creamish-white limestone. Broken away at neck. Surface badly chipped and worn, especially at brow and nose. Traces of black pigment (?) on hair and of pinkish cream on face to sides of nose.

Budde & Nicholl's suggested 'the treatment of the hair and the head-band seems to suggest that it was probably carved no earlier than late Hellenistic times... probably archaizing work of late Hellenistic date or slightly later' (Budde & Nicholls 1967, no. 80, pl. 26).
