Amongst the statuettes and figurines have been found mourners. The Brussels Museum posseses four figurines of mourners in terracotta, which date from the 1st Intermediate Period. The women are very characteristic: they are striking their naked chest, raising their arms in despair, or are bent by grief. This first piece depicts a mourner, with naked chest, pointing her left hand to her temple."}
