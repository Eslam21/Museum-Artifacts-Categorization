The greater part of a devotee of Isis, in full processional regalia. She wear a long chiton with a wide himation wrapped round (not an Isis-mantle, or at least not knotted at the breast; a fringe is not indicated); she also has a voluminous veil passing over her head, falling low on her left side, but less so on her right. Diagonally across her body is a tightly woven garland above a further garland consisting of bearded wheatears and three rows of round blooms; below this is a decorated textile band, one end of which hangs down in front. Her hair is arranged in a \u2018melon\u2019 style, with Isislocks falling onto her shoulders, and she wears ball earrings with an upper disc. She holds a sistrum in her raised right hand, the sistrum apparently supporting the veil. Her left arm is also bent upwards, with her left hand gripping the veil, and a situla with a knobbed base hangs from the crook of her arm. The back is plain and has a small circular depression pierced by a vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt; minute traces of a white dressing on the front.
