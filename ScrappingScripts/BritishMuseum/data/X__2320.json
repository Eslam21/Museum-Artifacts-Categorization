This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " In addition to glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids, the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 at Naukratis was also producing amulets (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming; see also Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Petrie listed a number of different amulet-moulds (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 12-17), but not of this peculiar type which is unique in the corpus of moulds. Several large glazed composition amulets representing a lion-headed goddess (Sekhmet) were discovered at Naukratis: BM 1885,1101.64; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.876; Montreal, Redpath Museum 2410. However, none were produced with this amulet-mould. Furthermore, this object does not appear in the original EEF distribution list for Boston. A similar problem appears for the amulet-mould Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45970. It is therefore very unlikely that these two amulet-moulds were originally discovered in Naukratis. Gorton, A.
