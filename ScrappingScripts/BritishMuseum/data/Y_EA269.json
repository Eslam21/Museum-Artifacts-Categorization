{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA269"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Maaninakhtef: two scenes are carved in sunk relief on this round-topped stela, and all texts are incised. In the upper register the deceased, whose name is lost, stands in adoration on the right before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by lotus blossoms. Behind it the god Ptah is enthroned followed by a standing figure of the goddess Maat. Below, in the lower register, the necropolis-workmen Maaninakhtef and Neferib kneel in worship. The upper edge and upper right side are lost and have been restored. The bottom edge has also been severely damaged. The surviving surface is much worn. Traces of red paint remain on the bodies of the figures, the outline of Ptah's body, the dress of Maat and the dividing lines between the columns of text. Blue traces can be seen in the hieroglyphs, the line between the two registers, the wig of the first kneeling human figure, the collar and wig of Maat and the cap of Ptah. Ptah's collars are red and black.
