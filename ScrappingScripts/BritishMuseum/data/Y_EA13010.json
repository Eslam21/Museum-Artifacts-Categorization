{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA13010"], "Description": [" Fragmentary brown diorite(?) male figure, the lower body now lost. The figure wears a smooth shoulder-length wig. His facial features are mostly obscured, though his eyes appear almond shaped with a visible cosmetic line at the outer corners. There is a thick line and the suggestion of sunken skin underneath the right eye. The remaining outline of his eyebrows suggests that they were slightly arched. The nose and mouth are no longer clearly delineated, and the face is fleshy and rounded at the jawline. His upper body is bare, with clear modelling of the chest and abdomen. Both arms are held by the side of the body and his waist is narrowed. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar that reaches to the ends of his wig. A slim column of incised text is defined by a border, with the lower portion of the back-pillar now lost. In addition to the break at the waist, there are small chips to the stone surface across the wig and body. There are further chips around the face. The object is now attached to a small modern base.
