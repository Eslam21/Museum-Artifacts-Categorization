{"artifact_name": "statuette", "Object Type": ["statuette"], "Museum number": ["117760"], "Description": [" Cast copper alloy statuette of a mounted rider: the rider is wearing Median riding dress with a soft cap and an 'akinakes' suspended from a waist belt on his right thigh. His tunic has edge decoration and he wears bracelets. The horse has a rectangular saddle blanket with edging tufts along the lower edge and stepped lappets at the rear. There is a strap below the blanket to secure either it or a pad-saddle and a breaststrap. The mane is pulled but has long strands on the lower neck and a forelock tied up into a splayed crest on the poll - all of which are distinctively Achaemenian features. The horse is shown in a fast gallop, and the pairs of fore and hind hooves are joined together for attachment to an element now missing (perhaps a vessel).

Kuhrt and others but was recognised as being of Achaemenid date by Ghirshman (who suggested a 6thC-5thC BC date) and P.R.S. Moorey (correspondence dated 18 December 1976). It was also illustrated in the 'Cambridge Ancient History', plates vol. IV, no.67.

This rider statuette has been incorrectly published as Parthian by a number of modern authors but the dress and distinctive dagger form of the rider and the manner in which the horse is represented imply a 5th or early 4th century BC date. Similar riders are also depicted on a post-Achaemenid pile hanging or carpet found at Pazyryk (Rudenko 1970: Frozen Tombs from Siberia: the Pazyryk burials of Iron Age horsemen, pls 174-76) and a decorated saddle blanket of felt with stepped lappets was recovered from the same barrow (Rudenko 1970: pl. 160).
