The fabric from this cup was analysed via NAA by Mommsen (Bonn) and the fabric was identified as belonging to a chemical pair with British Museum 19650930.972.a but the source of the fabric was not determined. Dupont and Thomas (2006, p. 80) analysed a similar sherd (sample number NAU 55), to which they attributed a Vroulian style. According to the analysis of the fabric of the sherd, the precise region in eastern Greece from which the vase originated is unknown but Dupont and Thomas discard both a Rhodian and Nile Delta production. They suggest that the sherd probably has a Dorian provenance and authors also point out that it is highly unlikely that sherds were over-fired during production but rather were damaged as a result of an intense fire. The sher possibly belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965,0930.972.c, 1965,0930.972.v and 1965,0930.972.p."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer & Villing 2006 / East Greek Pottery from Naukratis: The Current State of Research (p.56 Table 1) (Nauk 86) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GM.35) (phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.972.d"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 1886,0401.1378 "]}
