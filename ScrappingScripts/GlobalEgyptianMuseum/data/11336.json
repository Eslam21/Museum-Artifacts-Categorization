A broad collar completes his costume. In addition to a suspension ring at the neck, the figure's small dimensions indicate the amuletic character of the statuette, which may have been used as a pendant. The choice of gold as the material for the statue may have been determined by its significance as the \"flesh of the gods\", rather than its intrinsic value."}
