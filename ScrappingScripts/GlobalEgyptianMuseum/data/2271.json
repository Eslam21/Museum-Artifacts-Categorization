The published excavation report gives little information, but it appears that these were found with the burial of a mummified fish. The practice of mummifying large numbers of a particular species is attested only from the latest part of Egyptian history, beginning at the end of the eighth century BC. In some instances a species was buried as an eternal supply of food for its natural predator, and this might explain the burial of fishing equipment in this instance."}
