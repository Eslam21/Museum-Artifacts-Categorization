The rear shows a slightly convex impression of a textile or leather object, probably a bag. Three thin impressions of a string with a width of about 0.1 cm. At the flat upper side two third of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible, the sides are bending downwards and show many finger impressions. The seal shows a circumferential line, inside a nb-basket at the bottom, on top of this a seated falcon. The upper part is not preserved but is shown in EA86944 and EA86950 which have the same seal. The falcon has both wings stretched in front of the body, is facing to the left and wears the double crown and a flagellum but with a slightly rounded end.
