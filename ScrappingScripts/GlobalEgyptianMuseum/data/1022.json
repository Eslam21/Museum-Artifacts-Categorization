{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6342", "Dating": "13TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS ?", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "27 cm", "Width": "12.5 cm", "Depth": "19 cm", "Name": "Bust of a 13th Dynasty king", "Description": "This royal bust, probably dating to the 13th Dynasty, is the upper part of a seated statue. The pharaoh wears the nemes headdress with an uraeus, the protective serpent. Certain stylistic characteristics of the Middle Kingdom are still present, in particular those of Senwosret III and Amenemhat III: solid chin, high cheekbones, muscular and slightly prominent mouth, strong arches of the eyebrows, and a powerful torso. However, a number of features evoke the 13th dynasty, and in particular the reigns of Khendjer or Neferhotep I: the formal structure of the face, the synthetic and expressionless treatment of the volume of the figure, as well as other features such as the absence of decoration and of a cartouche on the waist."}
