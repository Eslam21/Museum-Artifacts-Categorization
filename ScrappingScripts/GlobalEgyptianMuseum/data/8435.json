{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "1980/98/254", "Dating": "MEROITIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "MASMAS:-NAG`GAMUS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "51 cm", "Width": "14.3 cm", "Depth": "25 cm", "Name": "Ba statue", "Description": "By analogy with ancient Egyptian representations of the soul (ba bird), the name \"ba statue\" is given to a Meroitic statue type, coming exclusively from Lower Nubia, showing a figure standing up with opened wings on its back. No statue has been found in situ, what makes one think that they were placed outside the tomb, depicting the transfigured deceased, before whom prayers and offerings were invoked. The piece in Madrid lacks its head, and is wearing a long skirt down to its feet."}
