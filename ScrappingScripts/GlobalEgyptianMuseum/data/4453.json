The stela has been covered with stucco on all faces but only one side has been painted. The scenes and inscription are framed by a coloured border of black, green, red and yellow and are very finely drawn.In the arch is the winged sun-disk and a pendant uraeus with a sun-disk on it's head. To the right of the uraeus is 'Bhdt' - 'The Behedite' - the epithet of the winged sun-disk. The main register is separated from the arch decoration by a row of snakes wearing disks, facing to the right, and a 'pt'-sign with stars on it.The main scene shows the deceased on the right, standing with arms raised in adoration of the god Re-Harakhty, who is on the left. The god holds a was-sceptre in his left hand and an ankh-sign in his right. Userptah wears an ankle-length skirt over a shorter kilt. Between the figures is an altar and an open lotus blossom. Four short columns of text above the figures give their names and titles. Below the scene are four broad bands of inscription, the htp-dj-nsw formula. "}
