{"artifact_name": "sandal", "Object Type": ["sandal"], "Museum number": ["EA53915"], "Description": [" Child\u2019s leather sandal with a sole swayed for the left foot, which consists of an insole and treadsole. These sole layers are secured with several, seemingly isolated leather thong stitches at the edge and with several stitches lengthwise down the centre. The straps are secured at the start of the heel and are sandwiched between the insole and treadsole. They run diagonally towards the front and cross each other, where they are secured, most likely with the element that also functions as the front strap. The straps have a cut out design of triangular and diamond figures lengthwise down the centre. The front ends of the straps are serrated. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Antique (?)
