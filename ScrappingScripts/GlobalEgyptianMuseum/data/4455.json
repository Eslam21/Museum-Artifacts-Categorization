{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M13989", "Dating": "22ND DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "PLASTER; WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Height": "27.5 cm", "Width": "24 cm", "Depth": "2 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "This round-topped wooden stela belongs to Hat and is divided into two registers, with three horizontal lines of inscription beneath. The wood has been carefully cut on all sides, the thickness of the stela is almost exactly the same all the way around. It is painted on one side only but there is stucco on all faces of the wood. Both paint and stucco on the right hand side have completely disappeared (see Preservation Comment in Advanced Mode).There is no outer border to the stela, in the arch is the winged sun-disk, beneath which is written the epithet, 'The Behedite'. The words 'Great God' are written to the right. This section is divided from the one below by a broad band.Underneath are four standing figures, all facing right - Re-Harakhty, wearing a sun-disk; Osiris, holding a was-sceptre and flagellum; Isis and Nephthys, who both hold long napkins. Re-Harakhty and Osiris are both mummiform, the two goddesses wear the traditional narrow ankle-length tunics with shoulder straps. Clearly the deceased would have been depicted on the right of the stela, facing the deities, but no trace remains. The inscription is at the bottom, reading from right to left, the beginning of each line being lost. The signs are boldly painted in black on a yellow background. The body of Re-Harakhty and Isis' dress are green, the goddesses napkins are red, as is the body of Osiris and Nephthys' dress."}
