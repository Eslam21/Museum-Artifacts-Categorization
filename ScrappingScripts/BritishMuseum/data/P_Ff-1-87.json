See Popham, 'Catalogue of the Drawings of Parmigianino', Cambridge, 1971, No.183. Popham 1967 The subject of the drawing on the recto is obscure. I now doubt whether it represents St. Ursula with some of her eleven thousand virgins, as is stated by Quintavalle, following my suggestion. Though most of the crew appear to be women\u2014and I know of no iconographical precedent for the virgins having worked their vessels\u2014 it is not certain that they all are. A group to the r. of the mast might be intended for the Virgin and Child and St. Joseph. Could the subject perhaps be the Holy Family on its flight to Egypt? The leg and arm on the verso are probably studies for the Baptist in the National Gallery altar-piece. Compare the study at Chantilly (N. 132 verso; facsimile by Rosaspina, repr. Copertini, i, pl. xlvi). The bearded head is almost identical with one on the sheet at Parma with the dead mouse (510/16; Freedberg fig. 56), on the verso of which are studies for St. John, St. Jerome, and the Virgin and Child in the National Gallery painting.
