{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 24345", "Dating": "PTOLEMY I SOTER I", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "PLASTER", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF", "Height": "15 cm", "Name": "Relief of Ptolemy the First Soter and Berenice the First", "Description": "The plaster impression is a high relief of a Ptolemaic royal portrait. It is one of the largest surviving ancient plaster casts in the Greek style. Much smaller Ptolemaic reliefs bearing similar royal portraits were found during excavations at Memphis, but none are of this quality. The subjects are identified as Ptolemy the First and Berenice the First. The cast is an invaluable document, for the typical portrait of Berenice the First is not successfully identifiable in sculptures or other objects. Details of the faces were altered after the cast was reproduced, as evident in the nose of the king, which has been reduced in size."}
