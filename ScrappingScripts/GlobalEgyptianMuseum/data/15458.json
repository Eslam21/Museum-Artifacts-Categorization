{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "SR 9130", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "35 cm", "Name": "Painted Statue of a Standing Woman", "Description": "The statue is of a female figure with her left leg forward and her arms held rigidly by her sides. A three-part wig tied with a red band frames her face and she wears a long tunic that shows the curves of her body. She is standing on a rectangular base adorned by a frieze of hieroglyphic inscription. This limestone statue still bears traces of the paint with which it was covered. Unlike sculptures in hard stone, those in soft stone were often painted, although the range of colors was very limited. The wig and details of the face were painted in black, the garments were white, the men's skin was red, and the women's skin was painted yellow."}
