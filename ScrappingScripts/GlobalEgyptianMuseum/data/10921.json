He is seated on a square block without a back support set on a pedestal which extends beneath his feet. The chest with its folds of flesh has been rendered in great detail. The right hand is fisted and the left hand is open; both are placed on the thighs. He is dressed in a knee-length kilt tied at the navel. The full face appears to have a double chin and gives the impression of being oval because of the short neck. The furrow between the nose and upper lip has been rendered with care and this makes the face seem lifelike. The outlines of the lips are clearly marked. The ears are not covered by the hair, which is rendered as a skull cap. The toes have been carefully separated from each other and even the cuticles have been indicated. A similar concern for detail may be observed with the fingers, where even the folds on the joints are visible."}
