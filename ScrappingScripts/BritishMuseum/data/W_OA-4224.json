This specimen and that cited by Launois 1969, 4, appear to have a star at the end of the second line, specified in the case of the one published by Launois to be six-pointed. On the British Museum's piece, owing to the positioning of the die, only the blurred edge of the presumed star is visible. On the one in the Muntazah Palace collection Miles notes the omission of th\u0101\u02be in mithq\u0101l, an error also found on the present piece.
