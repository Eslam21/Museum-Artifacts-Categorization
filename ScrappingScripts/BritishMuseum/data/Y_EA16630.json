The background, which was certainly moulded, is opaque deep-violet glass, its surface now pitted and iridescent and so making its original finish uncertain. In opaque white glass, matt surface, a priest or attendant walks to the left leading a small bull, presumably for sacrifice, from whose neck is suspended a lotus garland. At the base of the plaque is a flange for inserting the relief into a setting, doubtless a chest or some piece of temple equipment. Presumably the white relief was cut in place from a panel fused to the background. But if this was the technique used, it is difficult to understand why the violet background at various places rises almost to the top surfaces of the relief\u2014strongly suggestive of the effect of paint. Some of the petals of the lotus are completely tipped with this violet glass. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)

The correct drawing of the man's feet, the small scale of the bull, and the general over-refinement of the drawing are characteristic of Neo-Memphite work and establish the date. Similar forms in wood and ivory are known from this general period. This is the earliest example of cameo glass now known and is strong evidence for the Egyptian origin of the technique. An Alexandrian manufacture is probable. This panel was doubtless one of a series, comparable to the famous MacGregor ivories.
