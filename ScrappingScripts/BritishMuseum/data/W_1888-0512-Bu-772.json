{"artifact_name": "cylinder seal", "Object Type": ["cylinder seal"], "Museum number": ["89097"], "Description": [" Hematite cylinder seal; the king with a mace faces the suppliant goddess; between them, one above the other, are a couchant bull (?) looking back over its shoulder at the king, a hedgehog at right angles to the remainder of the design, and a striding, kilted figure on a base-line, who faces the goddess and raises one hand. To the left of the inscription two crude figures were cut, one above the other, to mask the remains of the earlier inscription: one is kilted, facing right beside a disc (chipped) and crescent, and the other is a \"bow-legged dwarf\", besides whom is a monkey (?); the two-line inscription is in a crooked frame and is incised over the erasure of an earlier inscription; chipped; the side with the inscription has been considerably rubbed down.
