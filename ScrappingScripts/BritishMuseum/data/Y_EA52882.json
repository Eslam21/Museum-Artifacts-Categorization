The stone bears the throne name of Hatshepsut. The hieroglyphs are unevenly incised and badly proportioned; the cartouche ring is spindly. There is no colour. A hieratic graffito along the left side of the cartouche (now almost invisible) is dated and dedicates the stone to Hatshepsut's Overseer of Works, Senenmut.

Such name stones seem to have been votive offerings placed by people involved in the construction of the temple. Comparison with another name stone from the site (1913,0724.4; fig. 47) suggests that it is an apprentice's work. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
