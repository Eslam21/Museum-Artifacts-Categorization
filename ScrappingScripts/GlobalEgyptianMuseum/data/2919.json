Examples of a wide number of species were mummified by the million in the Late Period to Roman Period in Egypt, about 700 BC to AD 100: often part of an animal, or even vegetal matter, replaced the full body of the intact specimen. The reasons for this late religious practice of animal mummification remain obscure, but may be linked to the renewal of the world at the New Year, in the Egyptian calendar the 'birth of the sun'."}
