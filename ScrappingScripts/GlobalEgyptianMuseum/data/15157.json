{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 53113", "Dating": "HATSHEPSUT/MAATKARE", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "62 cm", "Width": "33 cm", "Name": "Sphinx of Queen Hatshepsut", "Description": "Hatshepsut ruled as a man, not as a woman, and for this reason her royal protocols and titles are always written without the feminine qualification, which is the \"T\" letter in the hieroglyphic. This is the case in the text inscribed on the base of this sphinx where it is written, \"Beloved of the god Amun, endowed with life forever.\" In spite of her typical representation as a man, she is shown here with feminine facial features, especially in the full cheeks and lips. However, she has a long false beard like all male pharaohs. The name Hatshepsut is inscribed on the royal cartouche between the forelegs of the sphinx. The body is painted yellow except for the mane. The false beard and the ears are painted blue. This sphinx of Queen Hatshepsut is somewhat different from the traditional Egyptian sphinx, which was a human head with a lion's body. This sphinx has a human face, a lion's head with mane and ears, and a lion's body. It is made in the same style as the sphinxes of the Middle Kingdom found in Tanis, which have Asiatic features. This sphinx, however, has the beautiful features of Queen Hatshepsut."}
