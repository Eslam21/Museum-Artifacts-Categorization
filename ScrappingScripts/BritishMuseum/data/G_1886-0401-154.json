The interior decoration is more consistent with his Type 9B and Type 9C but the fabric is not typical of South Ionian cups. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 54, no. 14) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.672) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.154"]}
