BM EA 10655 and 10966 both join papyri in the Papyrus Carlsberg Collection that I am preparing for publication, i.e. P. Carlsberg 567 and P. Carlsberg 467. One is a ptolemaic annuity contract that is important since it mentions a hermotybies from Chemmis (one of the two warrior classes) and provides the first verification of Herodotus on this point.
