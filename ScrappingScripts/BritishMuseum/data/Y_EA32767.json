{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-box; figure", "Object Type": [" cosmetic-box ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["EA32767"], "Description": [" Wooden cosmetic-box held by a female figure. The young girl wears only a pair of large earrings with rosette centres. Her hair is plaited into three skinny pigtails, two of which hang down in front and the other behind. On her head she carries a rectangular four-legged casket, which is evidently rather precariously balanced: she grasps one of the legs to hold it steady. She is bent slightly forward under the weight of the box. The unusual hairstyle of this figure suggests that she may represent a foreigner. The hole pierced through this girl's free hand was probably intended to hold the handle of an applicator.
