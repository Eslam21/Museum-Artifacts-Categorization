Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two white bands (Williams 1983, 169). The number 22 is written in pencil and crossed out on the exterior of the left hand sherd; the number 35 is written in pencil on the exterior of the right hand sherd.
