{"artifact_name": "lantern", "Object Type": ["lantern"], "Museum number": ["1987,0402.23"], "Description": [" Terracotta lantern in form of seated slave. A lamp-holder for a miniature lamp in the form of a slave boy, seated on sloping ground, waiting for his master, with a lantern beside him. He dozes with his chin on his knees, which he clasps within his arms. The detail is very blurred, but he appears to have the hood of a cloak over his head, pushed back a little way. The receptacle for the lamp forms the plinth, which has a rectangular front with a plain moulding on all four sides; a triangular hole is cut into it to allow the light to shine through. The back of the object is plain, with a rectangular hole for placing the lamp, and a suspension-lug behind the neck of the boy. Hollow; two-piece mould, with added floor and a cut-out in the front of the boy\u2019s lantern. Micaceous (very small particles) brown Nile silt, the front having surviving areas of a white dressing, painted pink, with a little red paint at the base of the lantern.
