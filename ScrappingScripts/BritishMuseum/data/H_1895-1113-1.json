Smith, \"The Crucifixion on a Greek gem\", Annual of the British School at Athens, 1896-7, figure on p. 202 (discussed on pp. 202-6). A very early example of this subject. Cf. a gem with Crucifixion in Garrucci, Storia dell' arte cristiana, pl. 479, fig. 15; a green jasper, in the Collection at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, see Middleton, The Lewis Collection of Gems and Rings, &c., Class E, no. 1, p. 84, Cambridge, 1892; the ivory-carving, E.C. Cat. no. 291, and the panel of the doors of St. Sabina, Rome, see Wiegand, Das alterchristliche Hauptportal an der Kirche der heligen Sabina, pl. iv, Trier, 1900. Other examples of the Crucifixion treated in a primitive manner may be seen on a gem of Gnostic type, in the British Museum (Dept. of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities, no. G. 231); an amulet from Egypt in the Biblioteque Nationale, Paris (Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles), Fig. Schlumberger, Byz. Zeitschr. , 1893, p. 188 (sixth or seventh century); on a Monza Ampulla (cf. Garrucci, Storia, pl. 434, 4); and on objects from Akhmim (Panopolis) (Forrer and M\u00fcller, Kreuz und Kreuzigung Christi in ihrer Kunstentwicklung, pp. 16 ff. Strasburg, 1894). The primitive type is also perpetuated on a silver dish from Syria, see Smirnoff, 'A Syrian Silver Dish from Perm', in Materials for Russian Archaeology no. 22 (St. Petersburg, 1899) For a review of the earliest known representaions of the Crucifixtion in art, see H. Leclerq, Manuel d'arch\u00e9ologie chr\u00e9tienne, ii, pp. 368 ff. ; and Bela Lazar, Die beiden Wurzeln der Kruzifixdarstellung, Strasburg, 1912 (Zur Kunstgeschichte des Auslandes, Heft 98), where the present gem is reproduced in Plate ii, fig. 3.
