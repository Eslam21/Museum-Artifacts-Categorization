These figures are possibly associated with Near-Eastern deities such as Astarte or Atargatis (for a general discussion on this type of figure: Weiss 2012, 227-230, pl. 33f-g, type 125). In Greece, they might have been dedicated to Hera in Samos and to Athena in Kamiros (various figures of this goddess in Greece and Egypt: see Weiss 2012, pl. 78, esp. no. 1762 for this specimen). Kamiros provided at least a second example of this type of votive. Both can be dated to the 7th century BC. Riefstahl, E. 1943/4 Doll, Queen or Goddess? Brooklyn Museum Journal, 7-23.

", " Attributed to Kamiros Acropolis summit based on evidence from Biliotti's Kamiros diary. Description in Biliotti's Kamiros diary: Upper part of a bronze statuette of woman (1 broken). No marking of excavation day visible on the object itself. Attributions to find-spots are based on (1) Alfred Biliotti\u2019s diary kept during excavations at Kamiros between November 1863 and June 1864, which records the contents of two votive deposits and over 300 graves; (2) entries in the Museum Register, often stipulating the find- spots of individual objects excavated by Biliotti; (3) the Kamiros tomb list, produced around the same time as his entries in the Museum Register. It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960\u2019s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised according to tomb group; (5) the Kamiros well list, which is based upon the Kamiros tomb list with additions by Reynold Higgins and Virginia Webb. All archives are kept in the Department of Greece and Rome. In addition, Viriginia Webb\u2019s Archaic Greek Faience (1978) has been checked for attributions to Kamiros acropolis.
