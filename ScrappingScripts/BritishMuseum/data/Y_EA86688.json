{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86688"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a clay seal-impression, the rear shows a rounded impression like from a peg, the second side seems to be flat with impressions of string, so it might have sealed a door or a box? The fine brown Nile clay shows mica particles. The object was hardened after excavation. The top shows a deep finger impression and next to it a shallow impression of a scarab-like seal. The sealing was covered with hieroglyphs, the middle is divided by a horizontal line (n or s?), orientation not clear, but several smaller signs around the line, maybe a nfr.
