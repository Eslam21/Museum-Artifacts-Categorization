Below the perpendicular figure is an unidentified shape painted in light brown. To the right, amongst the human figures, there is another, unidentified infilled shape in light brown, in the shape of an elongated triangle with a flange at the base and a thin, bent point. To the left of this is an unidentified dark brown infilled triangle and on the bottom right there is a final unidentified white outlined shape.

This site is about 100m from 2013.2034.1-4 and some 15m up the wadi slope; A shelter about 5m by 2m with a flat overhanging ceiling. Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " garment "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh ", " Topographic representation of: Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.10"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYKTA0020006 (TARA number) "]}
