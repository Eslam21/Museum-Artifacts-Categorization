However this was registered with pieces labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary, during Gardner\u2019s season at Naukratis in 1885-1886. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DB.055) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Department": ["External"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 27?
