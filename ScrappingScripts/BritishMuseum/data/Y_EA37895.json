{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA37895"], "Description": [" Limestone seated statue of Meri: this statue shows Meri with short, cropped hair and a simple pleated kilt, resting his open left hand and his fisted right hand on his thighs. The cropped hair on this statue is often found on representations of middle-aged men. But there are no other signs of age: the pleated kilt is appropriate to a young man, and the position of the hands is found on representations of both young and older men. There is hieroglyphic text at the front of the plinth.

The two (very likely the work of the same sculptor) are almost identical in many respects. Both are the same size; both show Meri seated. The other statue (1902,0412.214) has short, curly hair, a kilt of 'shendyt' type, and arms crossed over the chest. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
