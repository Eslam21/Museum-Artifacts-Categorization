{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1449"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure group fragment. Small fragment of a dancing group: probably a maenad and a satyr. The woman, whose right leg is extended somewhat to her right, appears to wear only a himation, draped across her body from her left shoulder, leaving her right shoulder and breast bare: the two opposite long edges of the shawl are picked out in black paint, one edge passing near the right breast and under the right arm, the other curving down from the left shoulder, outlining her hip and the side of her upper left leg, to turn towards her right foot. Her right arm is bent, with the lost hand rising close to the right hand of the satyr: this hand is all that remains of him and his arm must have passed behind the maenad\u2019s neck to rest on her right shoulder; a break running from her left hip to her knee indicates that he was dancing close to her left side. Hollow, from two-piece mould. The himation and the satyr\u2019s hand are covered with a red slip; the black edges of the garment may be a fired on ceramic colour, or may be post-firing paint; some black specks remain near the satyr\u2019s hand. Red-brown Nile silt, with abundant fine gold mica, quartz and white inclusions.
