Carved in sunk relief with incised texts. The upper parts of three male figures are depicted, the first carrying incense and the other two with floral offerings. Nine columns of text remain, the first and last being fragmentary. There are gouges in the edges and there are no traces of colour.

L. Bierbrier, 'The late New Kingdom in Egypt (c. 1300-664 B.C.): a genealogical and chronological investigation' (London, 1975), 36-7). Tuy is known to have been Kaha's wife and Tentamentet was his daughter. Kaha was promoted to chief workman by year 38 of Ramses II, so this inscription must have been carved before then. A list of Kaha's monuments can be conveniently consulted in K. A. Kitchen, 'Ramesside inscriptions : translated & annotated Translations Vol.3, Ramesses II, his contemporaries' (Oxford, 2000), 598-609. Kaha had three other known brothers: Hay, owner of tomb 328, Huynufer and Paherpedjet, but it is likely that this fragment is part of a stela of Hay, one other piece of which is known. The first male figure would then be Hay himself. Bibliography: K.A. Kitchen, 'Ramesside Inscriptions' 7 (Oxford, Blackwell Press), 37; M. L.
