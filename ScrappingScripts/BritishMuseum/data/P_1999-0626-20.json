Ackermann, \"J-L G\u00e9rome\", Paris 1986, p.137, fig.339; P. Stein, in exhib.cat., New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and London, BM, `French Drawings from Clouet to Seurat`, 2005, no.83. Studying first in the studio of Paul Delaroche (1797-1856), and then briefly with Charles Gleyre (1806-74), G\u00e9r\u00f4me shared with his two teachers a taste for historical and exotic subjects and the technical ability to infuse them with a startling sense of ethnographic accuracy. He first found fame with the exhibition of `The Cock Fight` (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris) at the Salon of 1847. His early 'N\u00e9o-Grec' style soon expanded to include historical subjects and exotic genre scenes. There was a broad audience for orientalizing pictures in the mid- and later nineteenth century and Ger\u00f4me's appetite for travel allowed him to collect the raw material for his precisely detailed scenes. Reflecting European stereotypes of the Near East, his output was largely dedicated to subjects of violence and sensuality, but also included scenes of caravans, markets and prayer. Following his visit to Constantinople in 1875, it is known that G\u00e9r\u00f4me had the court painter Abdullah Siriez send him photographs,(n.1) yet one must assume that, for the most part, his own drawings made on his travels underpinned his orientalizing pictures. Despite their essential role in his working process, little study has been devoted to Ger\u00f4me's drawings. In general, they are impressive visual records, even if the motifs are sometimes anachronistic or implausibly combined in the paintings. The figure of the seated musician is used in a canvas, `Terrace of the Seraglio` (1886; private collection, London), painted late in Ger\u00f4me's career.(n.2) Much like Ingres's musician (1886,0410.33), her music-making accentuates the idle languor of the odalisques. Yet in Ger\u00f4me's harem scenes, there is a greater disjunction between the apparent authenticity of the various features of the canvas. The architecture, the standing eunuch with the pipe and the seated musician all appear to be based on observed reality while the porcelain-skinned bathers all seem like harbingers of the belle \u00e9poque. In the present drawing G\u00e9r\u00f4me transcribes with care the exotic costume and elaborate coiffure of the musician, with minor pentimenti throughout. The woman's eyes are hidden behind her hair, but her open mouth suggests that she is singing as she plays her instrument. Yet the realism is undermined by Ger\u00f4me's practice of freely mixing together elements taken from different cultures. In Terrace of the Seraglio both the eunuch who appears to be a Nubian slave and the girl playing the instrument seem to be based on studies made in Egypt rather than in Constantinople. The fringe of hair across the musician's forehead, the kurs (concave ornament at the crown of her head) and the safa (braids to which black silk cords were tied with thin gold ornaments attached at intervals) were all typical of the dress of Egyptian women in the nineteenth century.(n.3) Text by P.
