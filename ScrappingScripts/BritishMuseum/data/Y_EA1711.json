{"artifact_name": "relief", "Object Type": ["relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1711"], "Description": [" Limestone relief of Ramses VI: this fragment of a scene depicts the head and shoulders of Ramesses VI in raised relief. The king, who wears the Blue Crown, faces right and raises one arm in adoration. The other hand is lost. At the extreme right the upper part of a 'was'-sceptre is shown in the lower corner. Above the king a sun-disk with two 'uraei' is carved in sunk relief. Three vertical lines of hieroglyphs name Behdet, the great god, and the prenomen and nomen of the king. Only a fragment of the original scene is preserved. The top, bottom and right edges are broken and uneven. Traces of red paint remain on the face of the king and certain hieroglyphs and areas of the relief still preserve a coating of white plaster.
