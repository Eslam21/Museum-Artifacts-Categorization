This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Weights of trapezoidal profile with flat base and top are included in the dome or sub-domed category (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII, \u201csub-domed\u201d type; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). These weights represent a common type in Naukratis, and elsewhere in Egypt. They are often made out of igneous rock such as basalt and diorite, but other types of stone and metal are also well attested. Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 26). Sub-domed weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples. However a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). This is probably the case of this specimen which, when complete, would have weighted 40 shekel (ca. 330 g). Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
