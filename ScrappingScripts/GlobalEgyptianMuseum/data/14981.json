This very prominent position during the dynasty was not a religious post but a title that was used by Libyan generals to control the Theban region in Upper Egypt. Meanwhile, Lower Egypt was ruled by other kings in Tanis. There were relationships of marriage between the two houses, which were necessary to maintain the peace in Egypt, as it seems that neither was powerful enough to control the whole country. The mummy is in very good condition and examination has shown that the king died at a very young age."}
