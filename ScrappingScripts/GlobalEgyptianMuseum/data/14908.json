It shows him as a middle-aged man in the usual striding pose. Although the body was rendered in the traditional artistic style, well built and proportioned, his wrinkled facial features reveal his advanced age. His head is covered with a heavy wavy wig that falls upon the shoulders. He wears the pleated Shendyt kilt, fastened with a belt on which his name and titles are engraved. This kind of kilt and engraved belt were mostly reserved for royal personalities before the Late Period. The statue stands on a base inscribed with the offering formula and the name and titles of Montuemhat."}
