Wears a shendyt kilt and rests against an integral back-pillar, the back of which bears a vertical line of hieroglyphs containing the titulary of a king, perhaps intended for Pepi I but incorrectly written. On the right side of the back-pillar is a kneeling figure of a king in incised relief, with arms raised in adoration. On top of the plinth the nine bows are incised below the feet of the figure.
