", " The hieroglyphic inscription on its underside does not seem to make sense. The hieroglyphs are probably used here for their magical value as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). Falcon is a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d and appears on various compositions (on productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). This scaraboid is close to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 99, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype 149-158, see especially no. 152 for this piece). The motif on the underside, however, seems to be carved out rather than stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
