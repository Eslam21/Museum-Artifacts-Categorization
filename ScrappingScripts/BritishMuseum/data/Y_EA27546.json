Petrie mentioned among the finds two 'glazed pottery' figures representing 'Isis and Horus'. All identified objects from this context, other than the bronzes, are kept in the British Museum and this amulet is burnt and broken as were many objects stemming from this cache (Petrie 1886, 41). The cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). For the possible second amulet of Isis and Horus from the cache see BM 1885,1101.42. These two objects are the only Isis amulets in glazed composition kept in the British Museum and were both acquired in 1885. Isis was maybe wearing an hathoric crown or the throne sign (as illustrated on an amulet discovered at Herakleion Thonis: Goddio and Fabre 2008, no. 370). Isis - and particularly featured as Isis nursing - is a goddess relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets made of bronze or glaze composition (Masson forthcoming b).
