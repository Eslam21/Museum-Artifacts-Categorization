{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86809"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a convex impression like from a vessel or similar object, in the break one impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.2 cm. The front side is slightly concave, a bit more than the upper half of a seal-impression is preserved. A very thin circumferential line is visible, a horizontal line divides the seal in two rows. In the upper part a complex row of signs, in the middle a standing deity, facing towards the left, holding a wAs-sceptre in front of it. Another person to the left of the figure, a small nb-basket above it. To the right end of the upper part parts of a third figure with a staff in front of it, most broken off, partly an impression of chaff on top of the seal impression. The lower row shows a kneeling figure with its arms raised, facing to the left and a small sing (sun disc?) to the left of its head.
