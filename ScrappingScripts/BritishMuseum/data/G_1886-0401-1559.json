The metopal decoration consisting of vertical dividing bands and large maeander pattern is typical of the Wild Goat Style. The presence of interior decoration, however, suggests that the vessel is late in that style and may represent a transition to the Mature Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
