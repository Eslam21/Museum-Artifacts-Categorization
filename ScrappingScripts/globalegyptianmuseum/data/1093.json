{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6681A", "Dating": "UPPER PALEOLITHIC", "Archaeological Site": "KHARGA OASES", "Category": "AXE", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN", "Height": "13.1 cm", "Width": "7.4 cm", "Name": "Amygdaloid handaxe", "Description": "Handaxes are bifacially worked tools with rounded bases, sharp edges and a point. They are usually attributed to the Acheulian culture phase of the Lower Palaeolithic (in Egypt from roughly 500,000 to 200,000 years ago). This particularly fine, amygdaloid specimen, found in the Kharga Oasis, perhaps dates to this period, too. "}
