However, the concentric lines on the interior surface of the sherd find parallels with those around the tondo on South Ionian little master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9B (which also coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type XI [Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116]) or Ionian Cups Type 9C. This type finds parallels with the shape of Attic Little Master lip-cups. These cups have been found in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.824) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.633"]}
