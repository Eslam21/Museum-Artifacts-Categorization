", " Falcon is a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d and appears on various compositions (on productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). This scaraboid belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 99, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype 149-158). According to a better preserved example, it is possible that the elements to the left of the falcon represent a squatting god or godddess holding a papyrifom sceptre: see Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.700. If this identification is correct, the scaraboid then would belong to Gorton subtype 214-219b of her type XXVIII A.
