This seems to be the same style as the more common female limestone plaques of a naked straddling woman figures found at Naukratis dated by Petrie from 6th to 4th century BC (Petrie 1886, 40, Pl.19.4) and Edgar state these are common in the 6th century BC (Hogarth et al. 1905, 128, Pl.8a). These stylised examples are rare at Naukratis (British Museum 1965,0930.953; possibly 1965,0930.951), though larger Bes stele were also found at the site (see also larger stele fragments E.5019; 1885,1101.13, 1886,0401.1579). An unprovenanced parallel, but probably from Memphis or Naukratis, is known (Petrie Museum UC 60075). Probably 6th to 5th (or possibly as late as 4th) century BC."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (CE.176) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["ancient egyptian deity"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Bes (?)
