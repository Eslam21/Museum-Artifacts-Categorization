Beazley also suggests that should this sherd be the work of the C Painter, and that it might come from one of his later pieces. Brijder describes the Taras Painter's faces for youths and men as 'having pronounced profiles with protruding noses, receding mouths, and prominent chins' (Brijder 1983, 163).
