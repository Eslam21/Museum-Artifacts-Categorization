This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The composition including \u2018L-shaped\u2019 red-crowns is frequent on scarabs of the Second Intermediate Period, particularly the Hyksos Period (Tufnell 1984, 119, class 3B3d, pl. XII; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 293, pl. 54 no. 506), and the an-ra formula is particularly common during the 15th dynasty (Tufnell 1984, 121, class 3C, pl. XVI). A comparable treatment of the back is found on other scarabs from Naukratis that can be dated to the Second Intermediate Period: BM 1888,0601.65; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.857; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.3 (similar treatment of side also in that case). The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
