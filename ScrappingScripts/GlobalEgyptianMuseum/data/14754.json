{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "unregistered", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MODEL", "Material": "SCHIST", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Replica of Rosetta Stone", "Description": "The Rosetta stone is inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis and dated 196 BC., on the anniversary of the coronation of Ptolemy the Fifth \"Epiphanes\". The importance of the text lies not so much in its content, but in the fact that it is written in three languages, or more correctly, in two languages and three scripts: hieroglyphics, demotic (the popular form of hieroglyphics), and Greek. The original text was written in Greek, and the hieroglyphic and demotic versions were translated from it. Early Egyptologists, such as Thomas Young, recognized the potential of the decipherment of the hieroglyphs but it was Jean-Francois Champollion who made the final breakthrough and announced the means of understanding the phonetic system employed in the hieroglyphic text."}
