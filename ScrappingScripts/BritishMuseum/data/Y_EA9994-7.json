On this section of the manuscript, at the end of the verso, the apprentice drew calligraphic sketches of Thoth shown both as a baboon with a lunar disk, holding scribal equipment in his paw, and as a figure with an ibis head, wearing a lunar disk, and with an elongated 'ankh' sign in front of him. Elsewhere on this section there are palimpsest traces of jottings and doodles by Wenmediamen. Bibliography: E.A.W.
