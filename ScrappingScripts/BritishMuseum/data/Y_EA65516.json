{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA65516"], "Description": [" Stone figure of the god Khons-Thoth as a baboon. The fur around his head is wide and he has a long snout. The head and facial features are now extremely worn. Around his neck area are traces of incised detail, possibly to indicate the feathered hood layer of fur. At his chest is a pectoral with the image of an ibis. Though much of the stone is worn he appears to have his front paws resting on his knees. Between his hind legs his genitalia is exposed, and on his left side his tail is curled across the top of the base. The lower portion of his body bears traces of a red-brown colour. On the reverse is a broad back-pillar, though again the surface is worn and there is little suggestion of an inscription. The god sits appear on a high throne, which features the cartouches of king Sheshonq I. Around the right side of the throne are two horizontal lines of incised text, only a few signs now legible. The left side of the throne is now completely worn, but likely also included similar lines of inscription. There is damage and some discolouration to the top of the throne at the front and right side.
