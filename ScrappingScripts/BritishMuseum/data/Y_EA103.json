{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA103"], "Description": [" Scribal statue of Amenhotep son of Hapu: of black grano-diorite. Hieroglyphic texts are inscribed on the papyrus unrolled on his lap and on the statue plinth. His right hand, now broken, held a pen, as if writing, while his left hand holds the papyrus roll. On his left knee sits an ink container, with two cakes of ink. The Middle Egyptian text on the papyrus roll is written in vertical lines as if to be read by Amenhotep himself rather than by the actual reader standing in front of the statue. On the top of the plinth is carved a wish to be read by the viewer. This is the surface on which temple visitors could notionally place their offerings to Amenhotep. Even on this prestigious statue there is a corrected error in the carving: Anmun for Amun. Around the base is a single line of inscription, formed of two texts spreading out from the initial word of both parts ('The Prince') which is written only once, and meeting in the middle at the back.

In style the statue is modelled on Middle Kingdom forerunners. The statue acted as an intermediary between worshippers and the god: on another statue Amenhotep calls himself the 'herald of the god Amun'. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
