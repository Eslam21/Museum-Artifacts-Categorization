{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.6"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art (pastoral period?) on the underside of a projecting rock shelf showing twenty-five human and fifteen cattle figures, eight unidentified shapes and one possible therianthrope, in various orientations and attitudes, in a single large tableau. All the human figures are either light or dark brown, painted and infilled, while the cattle are depicted with either naturalistic or schematic coat pattern markings, infilled white, or brown and white bichrome, and with long white, upturned, lyre-shaped horns. The human figures are more concentrated on the left, and the cattle more on the right. At the centre left are three dark brown figures in a row, turned to the side and facing down with the heads to the right with attenuated waists and hips (women?). To the right of these is a bichrome cow. To the upper right are several smaller figures with the same pigment who appear to be wearing skirts, and others who appear to be reclining or upside down. At the centre of the image are two large ligher brown figures facing left. To the right of these is a mass of cattle infilled in white, brown and bichrome, with a single white cow figure at the upper left of the image.

Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " cattle ", " therianthropism ", " garment ", " personal-ornament ", " mythical figure/creature ", " bird "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh (Rock shelter up valley slope.)
