Ab\u012b Yaz\u012bd for a qis\u1e6d of the same substance (Balog 1976, 236). After discussing other remoter possibilities Balog preferred to read the commodity as sham\u0101r, said to be one of several alternative forms for the normal sham\u0101r, with the alif, meaning fennel. Two other stamps, one of them OA+ 4126, bear the name of a commodity which may indeed be read sham\u0101r, with the alif, and are presumably designed for fennel, but it is unlikely that the present piece and the similar one of Yaz\u012bd b. Ab\u012b Yaz\u012bd are in fact for the same thing. In the first place, the denomination, qis\u1e6d, is unprecedented for a herb or seed the sham\u0101r stamps are both for the mikyala. In the second, on the stamp of Yaz\u012bd b. Ab\u012b Yaz\u012bd the last letter of the commodity is of the large size-in proportion to the rest of the script which is characteristic of final nun rather than r\u0101\u02be. In early Kufic the forms are often very similar: on the British Museum's stamp the last letter is exactly like ra\u02be. However, in a good proportion of cases n\u016bn is quite easily distinguishable on account mainly of its greater size (see for example the Kufic alphabets illustrated by Abbott, pl. V.).
