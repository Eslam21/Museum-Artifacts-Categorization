{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5107", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "GOLD", "Technique": "FULL CAST", "Height": "7 cm", "Width": "1.9 cm", "Depth": "2.5 cm", "Name": "Gold Osiris", "Description": "A statue of Osiris in his typical guise, wearing the atef -crown and a divine beard, and holding the crook and flail in his hands held against the chest. A ring is attached to the back, allowing this figure to be worn as an amulet. The material gold is precious and easily recycled, which explains why comparatively few statues survive in this material. It is an appropriate material for the statues of deities because this metal, which shines like the sun, was considered to be the material of which the bodies of the gods were made."}
