The ball elements, forming less than a hemisphere, are made of two sections with a very neat vertical join. At the back they are finished with a flange 4 mm wide. A vertical supporting wire is attached at the back of the ball, and the end of the recurved hook is coiled around the end of it; the hook then runs up the back of the domed disc, about 9 mm in diameter, which is attached to the top of the ball. The join is concealed by a row of four gold grains.
