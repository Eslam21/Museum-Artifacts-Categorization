{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6442", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK ?", "Category": "FIGURED OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN; DRAWING", "Height": "8.5 cm", "Name": "Mice drinking wine", "Description": "This ostracon constitutes a lovely example of a story of animals. On the right, an enormous mouse, comfortably seated, drinks the contents of a jar on a stand with the help of an angled siphon. On the left, a skinny cat brings, respectively, a bowl and another vase. The message of this satirical scene is two-fold: transposition of the human to the animal and the reversal of roles between animals."}
