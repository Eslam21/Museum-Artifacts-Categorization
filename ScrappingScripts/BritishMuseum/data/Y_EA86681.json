{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86681"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression showing two rows of basketry coil impressions at the rear and at the side a further row, meaning that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles. The clay was hardened after excavation. The front shows one impression of a scarab-like seal, finger impressions around it. The seal impression shows a circumferential band that thickens in one part into a plant-like decoration in the upper right corner. On the left a falcon facing to the left, with a flagellum, right of it a small hippopotamus and on top of it a lying antelope or ibex with its head towards its back to the right. Underneath the hippopotamus and the falcon a lying crocodile facing to the left. The same motif is found on EA86925.
