{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA22784"], "Description": [" Bronze upper part of a standing man: with the remains of a sand quartz core. This fragmentary statue of a standing man wears a type of wig that was especially popular during the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Dynasties, and a modified version of the New Kingdom tunic, with less floppy sleeves. There seems to be no indication of the kilt or sash that one would expect with this garment. The man's bland, handsome face, a blend of several New Kingdom styles, resembles representations of Osorkon II and other figures of the Twenty-second Dynasty. Traces of gold show that it was at least partly gilded. The man's wig is quite clearly a separate piece. The chest is incised with a depiction of three seated deities upon a 'nb'-basket.
