The papyri are damaged and fragmentary, but they reveal detailed information about the organisation of a royal mortuary establishment and include duty rosters for priests, lists of offerings and inventories of temple equipment, as well as letters and permits. It is clear that the king's pyramid complex was constantly exchanging goods and offerings with state institutions, particularly the (now lost) sun temple of Neferirkare. Most of the papyri were discovered in 1893 in illicit excavations at Abusir (20 km south-west of Cairo), the location of at least four kings of the Fifth Dynasty. Individual sheets were subsequently sold to Egyptologists on the antiquities market and are now in Cairo, Paris and London. Shortly afterwards, the German Egyptologist Ludwig Borchardt identified the findspot as the administrative buildings near the pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai (third king of the Fifth Dynasty), and this was subsequently confirmed by his discovery of more fragments in excavations at the temple. The nineteen frames of papyri in the British Museum are the largest and most important group of the documents, and were originally purchased in Egypt by Edouard Naville, then by Borchardt. Czech excavations at Abusir in the 1980s have revealed more papyrus fragments relating to the temple of Khentkaues, a wife of Neferirkare, and of Neferefre, Neferirkare's probable successor.
