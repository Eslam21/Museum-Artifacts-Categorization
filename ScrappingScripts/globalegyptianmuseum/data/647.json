Capart. It was originally part of the R. Rochette collection, then of the A. Schayes collection and finally of the E. Fetis collection. The piece represents a man seated, dressed in a long cloak, accompanied by two people. It is  Satamon, flanked, on his left, by his daughter Baket, and to his right, by his secretary. The wife of Satamon, Karyfy, is found on the lower part of the statue, at the right of the secretary. The inscription written on the clothes of the main person tells us that he was an important government official commanding a fortress situated in the Delta. The statue probably dates from the beginning of the 18th Dynasty."}
