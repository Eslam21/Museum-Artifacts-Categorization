The present specimen was presumably acquired in Egypt and may be of Egyptian origin but it is impossible to be certain. While the date indicated above is probably accurate, an earlier date is also possible. Petrie found fragments of these bowls at San el-Hagar in a context of the second century A.D. (1885,1101.323 and 1885,1101.324). However, in excavating the Kushite royal burials Reisner found fragments apparently dating from the third and second centuries B.C. Bibliography : W. M. F.
