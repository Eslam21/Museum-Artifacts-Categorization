Above are eight columns of text containing a prayer on behalf of the deceased and a winged sun-disk. The scene is bordered by a curved sky-sign at the top and the standards of the West and East on the left and right sides. On the reverse the lady Tj(en)tdiashakhet is seated on the left.

The sky-signs are blue, while the standards have red poles with blue bands, blue tops with green and red appendages, and green signs with blue details in the sign of the West.
