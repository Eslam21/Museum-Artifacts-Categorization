The context of discovery can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). The composite figure represents the solar god and demiurge Atum (Weiss 2012, 178-180). This deity is very well-represented at Naukratis, particularly in the category of votive box and especially in the shape of lizard, snake and eel (Masson forthcoming b). This specimen belongs to the type 87 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 656-657, Taf. 26a-c, Typ 87). The god usually wears a double-crown for type 87 (Weiss 2012, 178-180).
