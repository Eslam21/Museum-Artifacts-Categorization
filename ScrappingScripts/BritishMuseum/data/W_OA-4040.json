", " It was Balog who suggested that the curiously written name of the commodity was meant to be 'kamm\u016bn' and that the accompanying adjective was 'abay\u1e0d', 'white', rather than 'aswad', 'black', as Miles had read it. Abya\u1e0d is certainly correct. As for 'kamm\u016bn', two other dies for white cumin are known to have been in use under al-Q\u0101sim: on one he appears by himself (Launois 1957, 67; Balog 1976, 205. Cf. Launois 1957, 68); on the other Muslim b. al-\u02bfArr\u0101f is also named (Miles 1971, 17). The present type fits admirably with these. No other stamps of a commodity qualfied as white have been published in the name of al-Q\u0101sim. As for the spelling of 'kamm\u016bn', it would seem that the first letter has been taken for the similarly shaped 'd\u0101l' and therefore separated from the next letter, as 'd\u0101l' should be but 'k\u0101f' should not. At the end of the word, assuming we are not faced with an alternative form of it, final 'n\u016bn' is omitted and the waw preceding it is written more like 'r\u0101'' or 'n\u016bn' or, alternatively, the 'w\u0101w' has been left out. Miles (1951, 16) has provided a lengthy discussion of cumin. Bibliography: Launois, Aim\u00e9e. 1957.
