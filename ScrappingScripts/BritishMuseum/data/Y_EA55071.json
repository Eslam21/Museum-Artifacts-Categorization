{"artifact_name": "model; boat; string", "Object Type": [" model ", " boat ", " string "], "Museum number": ["EA55071"], "Description": [" Rough wooden model of a boat: the hull is fairly deep with a good beam; it is hollowed out to a realistic depth, so that the gunwales are 2.8cm high above the deck. A thwart consisting of a length of untrimmed twig crosses the boat about amidships, and there are fore- and after-decks which are flush with the gunwales. Stern notched for steering-oar. The stump of a mast 7.3cm high, made of an untrimmed twig like the thwart, is placed immediately forward of it. A few remnants of cordage still cling to the stump, and abreast of it the gunwales are pierced as if to take ropes. A short square steering-post has a deep groove in the top, and the base has been shaved to an octagonal section. Associated with this boat is a steering-oar; it has a one-sided blade, the back of which is in line with the loom of the oar, and it is pierced with a hole in the middle of the upper part of the blade. No other gear.
