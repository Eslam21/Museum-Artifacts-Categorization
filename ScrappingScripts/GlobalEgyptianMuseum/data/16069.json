The upper part of the frieze is incomplete. The lower part depicts Saint Minas standing with his legs apart. Next to the saint are the camels that are with him in every picture because they are linked to his story. The camel on his right is raising its head and is facing backwards. On the other side of the saint and behind him, the second camel, which is seated, has stretched its neck forward with its face turned down. The lower part of the frieze is a colorful depiction on plaster of branches and leaves inside a rectangular frame. The frame is restricted on the sides by two large bands on which are the remains of ornamentation."}
