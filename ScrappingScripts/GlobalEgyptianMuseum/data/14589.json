The prow is in the form of an animal, but the stern is missing. The crew of the boat was apparently composed of eight sailors, four are still preserved, and just traces of the other four are visible on the boat's deck. The men are kneeling and wearing short wigs. From their posture and the holes pierced in their hands it appears that they were holding oars. Traces of colors are still visible on the model."}
