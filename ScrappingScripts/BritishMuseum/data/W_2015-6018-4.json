Her artistic training began in Egypt in 1965 and continued in London where she studied painting and printmaking at St Martin\u2019s School of Art between 1976 and 1978. A love of tradition and a desire to record it in the face of Saudi Arabia\u2019s rapid modernisation has influenced Safeya\u2019s choice of subject matter. She built a museum called Darat Safeya Binzagr, which opened in 1995, to house both her paintings and a growing collection of costume and jewellery from Saudi Arabia. The Darat Safeya Binzagr is an important cultural institution in Jeddah, not only as an art gallery but also as a meeting place for artists, intellectuals and students.

These prints were made at St Martin\u2019s. Faces was inspired by the faces of people she saw while walking through Berwick Street market off Oxford Street. It was made using the drypoint method with the image drawn directly onto the printing plate."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2015 11 Jul-4 Nov, London, BM, G34, 'From the figurative to the abstract: modern art of the Arab world' "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Safeya Binzagr"], "Funder name": ["Funded by: Contemporary and Modern Middle Eastern Art acquisition group (CaMMEA)"], "Acquisition date": ["2015"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["2015,6018.4"]}
