The majority of the antiquities brought back to Europe at that time came from the more easily accessible Late Period tombs and sacred animal catacombs at the latter site. One of the burials that evidently was accessible to collectors was that of Tarudj. An ushebti bearing her name was presented to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, by Archbishop William Laud as early as 1635. This figure formed part of the collection of the merchant Pitt Lethieullier, assembled in the early 18th century and given to the British Museum in 1756. Bibliography: J.H. Taylor and N.C.
