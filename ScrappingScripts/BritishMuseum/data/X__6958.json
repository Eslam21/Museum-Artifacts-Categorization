{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Head of a female limestone figure wearing a head-scarf. Broken at neck. The face is fully oval in shape with pointed almond-shaped eyes (embossed). The mouth with its slim lips shows a light smile. The headscarf is sharply separated from the face by means of a small stepped dent and is closely fitted to the head. It cuts across the large ears on which ear-caps are worn and falls onto the back from behind them. The jewellery is closely fitted to the neck and is set very high; similar to the headscarf, it is sharply distinguished from the skin by means of a stepped groove. The back of the head is flat. Chipped in places, especially around the right temple, the right eye, nose, chin, the centre of the mouth as well as on the back. Behind the ears chiselling marks are visible. Traces of red paint on neckband (single horizontal band at top, vertical parallel strokes, and two horizontal bands below [very faint]) and on lips, slight traces on nostril.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Faint marking '\u03a6' (?). Record card says 'found at Naukratis'. Published by the Allard Pierson Museum as from Naukratis (1937, pl. 30, no.519). With its broad, heavy face, lightly smiling broad mouth with slim lips and slightly oblique positioning of the almond-shaped eyes, this head is comparable to eastern Ionian heads of the third quarter of the sixth century BC. The scarf, here, covers the upper half of the ears while the ear-caps are clearly traceable under the cloth. This kind of headdress appears to be unusual if not unique among Cypriot heads. The rendering of the headscarf, which shows a dent at the temple, is paralleled in a Cypriot head in Paris, which Hermary (1989) dates to the last quarter of the sixth century BC (Allard Pierson Museum 1937, pl. 30, no.519). See also for comparison (Nick 2006, cat. 52 from London, UC16620; cat. 53 from Copenhagen 363; cat. 51, p. 122; pl. 21) . However many parallels from Naukratis would be dated earlier than this piece. Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600- 575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re- dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/ 550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
