{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.124"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on a limestone cave wall, showing four negative left hand prints outlined in blown dark brown paint. All handprints point up. The central, clearest print has the negative impression of another, long thin object to the left of it, pointing up. All are surrounded by many rounded, honeycomb-grid-style motifs in a paler colour, some covered over with hardened deposit. These are the remains of wasp\u2019s nests. The handprints to the left are faded on the left side and that to the upper left of these is covered with the wasp nest deposits. A 5cm photo scale has been fitted at the bottom left of the image.

This limestone cave site is a series of connected caves above the Wadi el-Obeiyd (also spelled el-Obeiyid), north of the Farafra Oasis, in Egypt. The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave has an entrance about 2.5m wide and 2m high with a flat natural lintel which makes it look from a distance as if it is man-made. The cave opens inside with a curved back wall and domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with circular rear wall. Both domed ceilings are smooth except for remains of old wasp nests forming small rough protuberances. These hand prints are on the left wall of the chamber, rising into the dome. The walls are scored by numerous parallel vertical striations and there are stalagmites near the cave entrance. These engravings are on the back wall of the first chamber. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["painted rock art"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.124"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010032 (TARA number) "]}
