{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA57586"], "Description": [" A string of disc, bicone and barrel beads of various materials: the largest beads are of translucent white quartz, lapis lazuli, banded chalcedony and glazed steatite. The central long truncated convex bicone quartz bead is bored from both ends; the other quartz beads flanking it are short barrels and short cylinders. Of the four beads of large diameter, two at each end of the string, the two short cylinders are of faded green glazed steatite, one short barrel is of banded chalcedony and the other of lapis lazuli. The remaining lapis lazuli beads are oblate disc and truncated convex bicone discs; the cornelian beads are cylindrical and truncated bicone discs. The string is completed by many small disc beads of shell, a single small disc of green glazed composition and one green glazed steatite cylinder.

This burial is dated to S.D. 56-8 in the Grave register, G. Brunton & G. Caton-Thompson, \u2018The Badarian Civilization\u2019 (London, 1928), pl.XXXI and to Brunton's Mid-predynastic (op. cit. 56) on the basis of the quartz beads. The pottery from this burial is datable to Kaiser's 11b, i.e. S.D. 38-40/5 ('Archaeologia Geographica' 6 (Hamburg, 1957), Taf. 22) while the single glazed composition bead would suggest a Naqada I date.
