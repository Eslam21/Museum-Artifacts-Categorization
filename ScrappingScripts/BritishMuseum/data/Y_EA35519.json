{"artifact_name": "jar-label", "Object Type": ["jar-label"], "Museum number": ["EA35519"], "Description": [" Two fragments of an ebony label: with an incised inscription on one side. The larger piece consists of the entire upper half of the label, with a hole at the top right-hand corner for attachment. It bears the incised name of Narmer and a place name. The smaller fragment comes from the bottom right-hand corner of the label and bears part of an incised sign, representing a jar full of liquid. Both pieces have suffered slightly from the formation of narrow splits along the grain of the wood, and the larger fragment has been restored from three small pieces, but the general state of preservation is remarkably good.
