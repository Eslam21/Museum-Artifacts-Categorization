{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86240"], "Description": [" Very small scarab, made of faience, completely preserved. Remains of a beige glaze preserved. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line as are the division lines between prothorax and elytra as well as the suture. The humeral callosities are indicated by a small vertical notch. The shape of the head is trapezoidal, no eyes are visible but the clypeus shows 4 notches. The side of the scarab shows two legs on top of a base plate at each side, no further details visible, no circumferential lines. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. An upright wAD.t facing to the right is incised as only sign. The orientation of the seal is longitudinal. The same can be said for the perforation of the object, which is slightly askew though.
