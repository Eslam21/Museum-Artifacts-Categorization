Petrie mentioned among the finds two 'glazed pottery' figures representing 'Isis and Horus'. All identified objects from this context, other than the bronzes, are kept in the British Museum and this amulet is burnt and broken as were many objects stemming from this cache (Petrie 1886, 41). The cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). For the possible second amulet of Isis and Horus from the cache see BM 1885,1101.53. These two objects are the only Isis amulets in glazed composition kept in the British Museum and were both acquired in 1885. Isis nursing is a theme relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets made of bronze or glaze composition (Masson forthcoming b). Isis lactans appears to be an important amuletic figure for the mummy but also used in the daily life for the protection of women and children (Andrews 1994, 48). Such figures were also deposited as ex-votos. They became truly popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314; Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, pl. 56, G12).
