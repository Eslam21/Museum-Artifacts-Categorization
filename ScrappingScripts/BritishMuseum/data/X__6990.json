", " The collection of F. W. von Bissing holds a significant group of figures in glazed composition mainly dating to the late Ptolemaic (maybe extending to the early Roman), in a few cases earlier. They often depict more Greek themes, though not always. The Naukratite origin of this lot, which ended in the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, appears dubious. The same can be said of the bronzes from this collection. This figure is made of a completely different faience from the earlier material from Naukratis and is also in a very good state of preservation.
