", " This amulet was found in a box labelled '84 extra' and possibly originates from Naukratis. In addition to scarabs which were mass-produced especially for export, wedjat eyes, mainly in glazed composition but also in hard stone, form the main type of amulets found at Naukratis. Amulet with universal power of protection (Germond 2005, 25), the wedjat eye, simple or multiple, is one of the most common amulet on settlements of the Late Period (Masson forthcoming). This highly schematic multiple wedjat-eye finds various parallels dated to the Late Period (see for example: Masson 2007, pl. XXX no. 2, from a late 26th-early 27th dynasty context).
