{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA57294"], "Description": [" Brass lamp: rounded elongated body and long nozzle, with flaring tip, dished round the circular wick-hole. Raised, moulded rim round the filling-hole, stepped internally for a lamp-lid now lost, and with hinge-pieces at the rear. The lamp has an alien lid, attached to the hinge with bent wire: it does not fit the hinge or the step. The lid, which could conceivably be an ancient replacement, is decorated with the head of a bald and bearded satyr. It is circular with a hinge-piece at the rear edge, and is hollow behind, with a step for its reception into a filling-hole. Elaborate double rod-handle at the rear, curving up and forward, joining and separating, with leaves emerging from it, joining again at the front and surmounted by a youthful male head, modelled in the round. A bud above the first join is hollow at the top, and may have supported something, possibly a cross. The two springs of the handle are decorated with a relief of a youthful male head in profile. Each wears a diadem and has a wing or a leaf behind his head: perhaps a cherub. Substantial raised base-ring, with mouldings on the outside and inside; in the centre is a square socket for the spike of a lampstand; its sleeve inside the lamp is baluster-shaped, with a polygonal lower stem. Surface colouration: cleaned to bare metal.
