As well as those on which the colour is not specified, stamps for red (ahmar) and black (aswad) lentils are known, the latter being represented in the British Museum's collection by the anonymous OA+ 4127. No doubt the coloured types were the varieties of the common lentil which have differently coloured seeds. It may be noted that in the 'Description de l'Egypte' it is more than once stated that Egyptian lentils were reddish. The Romans regarded the lentil as being particularly associated with Egypt and it has remained of course a major food crop since that time. The usual details concerning cultivation and taxation are given in the Ayyubid and Mamluk manuals. Lentils are also mentioned in papyri.
