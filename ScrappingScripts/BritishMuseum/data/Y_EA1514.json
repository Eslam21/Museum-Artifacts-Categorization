{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1514"], "Description": [" Scribal statue of Pesshuper: a red quartzite statue of the Theban high official Pesshuper as a scribe. Hieroglyphic texts are incised on the plinth, on the papyrus roll on Pesshuper's lap, and on the back pillar of the statue. Pesshuper's left arm, which holds the roll, is damaged. On his knee is a shell-shaped container with inkwells, and over his left shoulder is slung the hieroglyph representing scribal equipment. On the roll the traditional funerary invocation is inscribed in vertical lines so as to be read by the statue, not the spectator. On the right arm is written the cartouche of his patroness. Further funerary invocations are written on his kilt in eight vertical lines and around the plinth, in a single horizontal line. Three more vertical lines (right to left) are inscribed on the back pillar.

Passhuper's double wig is the restrained version without front lappets, characteristic of the Eighteenth Dynasty; his cross-legged pose, the position of his hands, and the fat folds on his torso go back to the earliest scribe statues of the Old Kingdom. The long kilt that conceals his legs, an invention of the Middle Kingdom, was not combined with scribal accessories until the Nineteenth Dynasty, so the model or models for the pose of this statue probably dated from that time. The back pillar was a Twenty-fifth Dynasty addition: earlier scribe statues did not have back pillars. Passhuper's noble face, though not a portrait, is also of his period. The low brow and elegant but not exaggerated contours of his eyes and brows are especially characteristic of many fine Twenty-fifth Dynasty statues. The statue probably came, like others of this official, from a chapel in the temple enclosure of Karnak, and may have been modelled on earlier statues of the sage Amenhotep son of Hapu. It represents him with two rolls of fat in his abdomen, a sign of his prosperity. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
