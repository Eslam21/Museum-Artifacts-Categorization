{"artifact_name": "dipper", "Object Type": ["dipper"], "Museum number": ["1894,1101.233"], "Description": [" Bronze dipper jug with a hinged handle, possibly used for serving wine hammered from sheet metal with cast (?) handle; the jug is depressed ovoid in shape, rather baggy in profile, with a high collar at the back and a flat everted rim; the handle has a rounded section, terminating in a curved duck's head with a long, concave beak; at the other end, the shaft of the handle widens into a triangular lotus-like (?) profile with three concentric mouldings at the base, on the top of which is a rectangular place to which the circular hinge is attached; surface corroded in places.

See Matth\u00e4us 1985, 257-60 for a survey and discussion of the three known examples of this type in Cyprus, tow of which come from Tomb 84. They are widely distributed in the Mediterranean. Vonhoff (2015, 280-1) considers the type to be a Phoenician version of a type first attested in Egypt from the time of the Bronze to Iron transition, though some features - such as the bird-headed handle - are found in Cyprus already in the Late Bronze Age (deriving from Near Eastern prototypes).
