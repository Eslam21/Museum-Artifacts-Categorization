The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which has the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily, and carelessly, in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Stylee group display a mixture of techniques, consisting of the portrayal of female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure. For parallels regarding the female figure, see Leiden N3. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
