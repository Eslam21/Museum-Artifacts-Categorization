{"artifact_name": "kohl-tube; textile", "Object Type": [" kohl-tube ", " textile "], "Museum number": ["EA23063"], "Description": [" Upper half of a 'kohl' tube of palm-column form: dark-blue glass body, core built, with yellow and white trailed decorations. The circular opening and the individual elements of the capital are outlined with white threads three of which also encircle the shaft directly below the capital. The lower half of the column was decorated with simple festoons in opaque yellow and white glass. Immediately adjacent to the rim the walls of the cylindrical interior are covered with a single layer of linen which adheres closely to the surface. This is surely the remains of the stopper which was a wad of linen, a common form of stoppering. Another form in common use was a small bunch of rush or papyrus. Incompletely preserved but otherwise in good condition.
