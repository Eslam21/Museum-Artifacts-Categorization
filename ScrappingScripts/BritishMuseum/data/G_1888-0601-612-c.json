Gardner 1888, 47, mentions grey wares as common finds in the sanctuary of Aphrodite, including \"large conical stands, with raised bands round the base\" and also lists the inscription on the piece among the incriptions from the Aphrodite sanctuary (Gardner (1888 p. 47, pl. XXI, no. 790). However, the modern scratched inscription 'Hera' on its interior surface seems to indicate the sanctuary of Hera as the findspot. Gardner (1888 p. 47) suggested that these grey ware vessels originate from Mytilene or another site on Lesbos because some of the inscriptions on them are dedications made by Mytileneans or at least in non-Ionic dialect. Lamb 1932, 8-9, fig. 3.7, notes parallels for stands with plastic mouldings around the base (and/or top?) from Methymna on Lesbos. Recent NA analysis by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, attributed a very similar piece, British Museum 1888,0601.613.a, to a chemical pattern (B-Troy, now called TROB) that is otherwise observed in and very likely local to the Troad, thus raising the possibility of a production on the mainland opposite Lesbos rather than on the island itself (Mommsen et al. 2006, 70, sample Nauk 63; Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006, 58, fig. 12; Mommsen et al. 2012, 440).
