", " Though many close parallels exist (particularly the flat-chested types from Yeroskipou-Monagri in Karageorghis 1998, 15-17, pls 8.7-11 Types I(i)77-80), the goddess with uplifted arms type continued from the \u201811th down to the early 5th centuries BC, with very few changes\u2019 (ibid. 17).

This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.
