This specimen belongs a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype A1-9, see especially A7 for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122). Egyptian blue scarabs depicting the same scene were discovered in Sardinia and Ibiza (Gorton 1996, 122-123, A2-3).
