{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 97472", "Dating": "PREDYNASTIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "MARIMDA BENI SALAMA", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED RELIGIOUS AND CULT OBJECT", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "BURNED, OXIDIZED", "Height": "10.5 cm", "Width": "6.7 cm", "Name": "Head of a Deity", "Description": "The oval face represents a man or perhaps a deity. The face has holes of various shapes and sizes representing the eyes, nostrils and mouth; the nose is a gentle protrusion. There are small holes all around the skull, presumably to hold tufts of real hair. The entire face was apparently painted ochre, or orange-yellow, and still bears visible traces of that color. There is a deep hole under the neck, which suggests that the face was once fixed to a post and was probably used in cult ceremonies"}
