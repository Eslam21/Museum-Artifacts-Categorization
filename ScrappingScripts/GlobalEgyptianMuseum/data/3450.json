{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1977.110.31", "Dating": "13TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ESNA", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "INCISED", "Height": "51 cm", "Width": "30 cm", "Depth": "5.5 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "A fine round-topped stela of limestone, one of the few precisely provenanced pieces and, according to Downes, 'the most handsome of the stelae found at Esna'. The stela is decorated on one side only, the face very smooth while the back is left rough. The figures and the inscriptions have been deeply and carefully incised, one scene with six horizontal lines of text above (see Text Comment in Advanced Mode/Textual Data).The stela differs from others found at Esna as there are no udjat-eyes in the arch at the top. Below the inscription is a single scene depicting the deceased, Horhetep, standing to the left with his arms down by his sides. Opposite him at the right is his brother, Senebsuma, who holds a censer towards Horhetep in outstretched arms. Both of the men wear the traditional short, pointed kilts. There are no inscriptions around the figures, the surface is very plain."}
