Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains ritual/magical texts which continue on the verso. The text is written in horizontal lines. This frame contains four fragments (unmentioned and unpublished by Gardiner). These fragments were first identified as part of a single papyrus and numbered 19 in 2006. This frame is labelled as 'P. Ram. Frags.'. The papyrus was probably a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
