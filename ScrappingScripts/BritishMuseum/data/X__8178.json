", " Square and parallelepiped weights are commonly found in Egypt and appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII). They were manufactured in a large range of material: they were more often made of all sorts of hard stones, especially white limestone, alabaster but also various colourful stone such as marble, serpentine, porphyry (etc.); in Naukratis, such shapes occur also regularly in basalt, diorite, granite and sandstone; bronze and lead examples are at last quite numerous (Cour-Marty 1990, 26-27, fig. 9-10, fig. 13). Weights of this type in igneous rock, such as this specimen, are mainly in use during the Late Period and associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (Cour-Marty 1990, 27). This specimen however is linked with another standard. It could derive from the Royal Hebrew shekel around 11.3g (Kletter 1998), or more probably, according to its context of discovery, from the Persian silver siglos around 5.3 and 5.6 g. Square and parallelepiped weights seems particularly associated to the latter in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII). This weight corresponds likely to 40 sigli. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
