{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8420", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM (not before); 18TH DYNASTY ?; NEW KINGDOM (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "DISH", "Material": "GLASS", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED", "Height": "3.5 cm", "Diameter": "7,7 cm", "Name": "Beaker on pedestal", "Description": "It is not easy to work out how this object was made. The open form was probably achieved by modelling the glass on an almost circular mould. The two rims were then worked intensively. The pedestal appears to have been made separately. The Brussels piece is one of three examples of the same type of beaker made of dark-blue glass. Identical beakers without pedestals, dating to the 18th Dynasty, are of a type whose design was probably imported from Syria."}
