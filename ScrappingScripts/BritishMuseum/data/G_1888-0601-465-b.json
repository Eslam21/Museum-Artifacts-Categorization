The sherd probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965,0930.338. Lemos describes the sherd as coming from a mediocre but big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group also display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
