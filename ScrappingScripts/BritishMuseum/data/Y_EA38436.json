{"artifact_name": "askos", "Object Type": ["askos"], "Museum number": ["EA38436"], "Description": [" A bird 'askos', probably a dove, with a funnel-shaped mouth rising from its back. The body is formed from a wheel-thrown pot, with the tail fashioned by pressing the mouth of the pot together and luting it closed. The neck and head of the bird were separately modelled, perhaps wheel-thrown and manipulated, and applied; the beak forms a spout. Pellets were added for eyes, and minuscule wings applied: one is lost. Brown Nile silt with many sand inclusions; much of the surface has fired buff.
