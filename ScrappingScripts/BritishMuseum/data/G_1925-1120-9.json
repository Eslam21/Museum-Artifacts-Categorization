{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.9"], "Description": [" Terracotta female figure, devotee of Isis. A devotee of Isis, standing and wearing an Isis-mantle knotted between the breasts. She carries a fringed scarf, presumably of ritual significance, over her left shoulder, her left arm contained within it like a sling. The right arm is lowered and largely lost below the elbow. Her hair rises from her forehead and falls in curls on each side of her face. Her feet, and any plinth that the figure might have had, are broken away, together with much of her right side below the breast. The back, which has suffered through spalling, is treated in a summary manner, but the fringe of the scarf is indicated; there is a small circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with a brown core, and traces of a white dressing on the front. The interior has been filled with a hard off-white plaster, possibly but not certainly in modern times, to help fix the figure to a stand (a modern hole is bored into it).
