{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1973.4.234a&b", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Width": "10.2 cm", "Name": "Pair of votive stelae", "Description": "These two round-topped stelae appear to make up a pair, both were originally covered in stucco on all sides but each is decorated on one side only. B is slightly flattened at the top whereas A has a well defined curve. The painting on both stelae is crudely executed, the background on both is white and in the lower half two horizontal lines have been drawn roughly parallel to each other. On A, between the lines, two horned vipers have been painted, facing right. To the left of them are other marks but it is difficult to define whether these are specific signs or simply splashes of paint.The decoration on B has almost completely worn away, traces of paint are still visible, including some in the upper band. On the outer edge of B, at the height of the lower band are two large holes which run through the stela. There is also another hole lower down in which a dowel still remains. On A at the top left and right along the arch are two holes, both with dowel pegs still intact.A ridge can be seen on the back of both stelae directly below the bottom bands, possibly indicative of the height to which they were embedded in the ground."}
