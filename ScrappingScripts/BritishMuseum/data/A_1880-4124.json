C. Fabr\u00e8gues: This type of ear-ring has a long history. It first appeared in the Hellenistic and Roman world, as can be seen from two examples broadly dated c. 2nd century BC to 3rd century AD: one decorated with a blue glass flower at one end (GR 1917,0601.2448) and the other with a cube (Lester 1991, p.23, fig.5). A third example, dated 6th century, differs from the Begram specimen only in that it is gold and has soldered onto the hoop an ornate filigree pendant from which a pear-shaped ornament of dark blue glass is suspended (GR 1872,0604.594; Marshall 1911, p.310, pl.LV.2691). The type continues in the Byzantine period until the 12th century at Sardis and Corinth (Waldbaum 1983, p.125, no.743 pl.46.743; Davidson 1952, p.252, pl.109, no.2024). It was also prevalent in the Islamic world of the 8th-14th century at sites such as Nishapur (Allan 1982, p.67, nos.43-4), Fustat in Egypt (Lester 1991, fig.6), as well as in Tajikistan (Zeimal 1985, p.325 no.828) and Kazakhstan (Baipakov 1990, p.157). Despite the longevity of the type, the Begram ear-ring can be approximately dated c. 1st-3rd century, as it has exact counterparts from sites nearby: one in gold was found in a tomb of the 1st century BC-1st century AD necropolis at Tulkhar, south Tajikistan (Mandel\u2019stam 1966, pl.LX), and another in bronze on the c. late 1st-3rd-century acropolis at Surkh Kotal (Fussman and Guillaume 1990, p.121, no.234, pl.5.234, pl.VIII.234).
