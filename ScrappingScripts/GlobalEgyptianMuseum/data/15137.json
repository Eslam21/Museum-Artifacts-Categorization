The vessel and its base were formed in two pieces and joined together. The base depicts an Ankh sign on either side of the jar stand. The vessel itself is part of an overall design signifying the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt as shown by the presence of the Sema-Tawy sign. There is a portrayal of a human face wearing a collar, perhaps Tutankhamun. The traditional names and titles of the king are displayed on the body of the vessel. On both sides plant decorations are found."}
