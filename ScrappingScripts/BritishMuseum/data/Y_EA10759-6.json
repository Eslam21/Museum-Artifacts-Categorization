{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10759,6"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum 6"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum 6, Frame 6. Papyrus written on the recto in linear hieroglyphic script. The recto contains a hymn to Sobek, while the verso is blank. The text is written in vertical columns between ruled lines with titles in horizontal lines, in retrograde script. Over 140 lines of a Middle Egyptian hymn cycle are preserved on the roll, which is not complete. This frame contains lines 100-120. The papyrus was a half-height roll. Three additional fragments of the roll (see Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, pl. 21) are now mounted in other frames (Frag. A in EA 10760.3, Frag. B in EA 10760.7 and Frag. C in EA 10760.5). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
