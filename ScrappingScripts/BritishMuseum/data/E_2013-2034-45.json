{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.45"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); detail of painted rock art on rock face (sandstone?) showing nine unidentified quadruped animal figures, all painted in white pigment and all upright and facing right but for a small, infilled figure in the centre (bovid/equid?) infilled and facing left towards a similar figure facing right. Both these figures have short upturned tails suggestive of goats, as do the four figures at the base of the image which also have udders with two teats. The two on the left with white infill, the two on the right naturalistic coat pattern markings. Above these is the largest central figure, that of an unidentified quadruped, not infilled and in a whiter and fainter pigment than the rest, with a body suggestive of a cow and a trunk (elephant? mythical creature?). There is a tusk like protuberance from its head and what appears to be an arrow in the back of its head. Above this figure is the small figure of what appears to be a carnivore (striped hyena?) with a bushy tail, compact build and legs extended as if leaping. Infill has been left clear in five vertical lines across the body. At the top left of the image is the forequarters of a larger herbivore, cut off the edge of the image at the trunk.
