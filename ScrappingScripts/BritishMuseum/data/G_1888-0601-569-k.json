If the sherd belongs to the same cups as British Museum 1888,0601.569.e, then this sherd belongs in Kinch's Group B 1.\u03b1 or .\u03b2 of Vroulia cups. It is impossible to determine to which of the two groups the cup belongs since the defining characteristic is found on the underside of the stemmed foot, which is now lost. Schlotzhauer comments that 1888,0601.569.e ought to be placed amongst the earliest Vroulia examples at Naukratis because of the geometric pattern in the handle zone and because the shape of the cup shares similarities with his South Ionian cup Type 8, which coincides with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian cup type A1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88) and Hayes' Ionian cup type III (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GN.21) (phase 3) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 163) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.569.k"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 02 Feb 1994"]}
