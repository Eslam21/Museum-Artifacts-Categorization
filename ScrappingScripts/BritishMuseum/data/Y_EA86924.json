{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86924"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows a darker discolouration. The rear shows one coil of basketry on one side and one coil of basketry on a second side that runs horizontal, possibly a broken part, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side is flat and shows a deep and an almost complete impression of a scarab-like seal with finger impressions visible around the seal impression. Recognisable is a djed pillar in the middle with cobras on each side facing towards the pillar. The same motif is found on EA86917.
