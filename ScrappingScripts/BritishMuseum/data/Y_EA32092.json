{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA32092"], "Description": [" Red breccia axe-head: carefully ground into shape and polished. It has a narrow, very slightly convex butt, and splayed sides that turn outwards slightly towards the cutting edge, which is moderately convex. The sides and the butt are squared. At the rear end are two perforations, correspondingly positioned in a line parallel to the butt. The cutting end is damaged at several points along its width, though the chipping is confined almost entirely to one face. This same face has a weathered appearance at its butt end. On the other face small inclusions have been displaced from the matrix, leaving holes in the surface.
