{"Present location": "BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA ANTIQUETIES MUSEUM [01/027] ALEXANDRIA BAAM", "Inventory number": "610", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "EL-BERSHA", "Category": "OFFERING TABLE (Htp)", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "19.2 cm", "Width": "37 cm", "Name": "Rectangular Offering Table", "Description": "Offering tables were intended for food presentation but also had channels to allow water to be poured over them and to be collected. The water would be imbued with real power from the stone or pottery offerings and seemed to have been blessed in some way. Perhaps the water would bring the food offerings to life for the nutrition of the Ka in the afterlife. On the surface of this rectangular offering table, two libation vases are depicted in high relief, flanked by two circles. Each of its sides bears one line of hieroglyphics."}
