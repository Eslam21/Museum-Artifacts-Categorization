{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85616"], "Description": [" Almost intact clay figure, including a highly stylised head. The figure has the form of a flat rectangular plaque, which flares out very gently towards the base in profile. It has been modelled with reasonable care. Two widely spaced holes, surrounded by circular interruptions in the surface of the clay, mark areas where breasts have broken away. No navel, pubic triangle or body decoration has been marked. The head has been applied separately and slightly off centre, as a low flat disc. There is little room to show facial features, and none have been marked. The clay along the base of the figure has been pinched out, especially along the reverse, but the figure seems unlikely to have stood unsupported. Just along the top of the ridge on the front face, which is not particularly distinct, is a faint horizontal incision that is perhaps deliberate. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica.
