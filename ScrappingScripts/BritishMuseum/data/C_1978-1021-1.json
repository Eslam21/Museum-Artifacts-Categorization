The portrait of the young Ptolemy VI strikingly resembles that of his father. The ruler is youthful in appearance, and has a pointed chin and straight, long nose. His hair is short and he wears a diadem, tied behind his head with two straight ends. Cleopatra I wears a 'stephane' (diadem) and veil."], "Bibliographic references": ["Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth (77)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Cleopatra I ", " Representation of: Ptolemy VI Philometor "], "Acquisition date": ["1978"], "Department": ["Coins and Medals"], "Registration number": ["1978,1021.1"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 17 Aug 2000"]}
