{"artifact_name": "vessel; lid", "Object Type": [" vessel ", " lid "], "Museum number": ["EA86133"], "Description": [" Flat base or lid of a vessel made of calcite with a diameter of 11 cm. The exterior surface of the base itself is so well smoothed that it suggests a primary usage as a lid. The exterior walls were at least 4.5 cm high. The object was later reused as a bowl. At that stage the exterior walls that were broken off were preserved at slightly different heights and were smoothed irrespective of the varying heights. The interior surface of the bowl shows a circular depression of a diameter of 5 cm that is slightly acentric. This suggests a usage as a mortar.
