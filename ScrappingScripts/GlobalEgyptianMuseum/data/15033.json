The stand and sledge are made of ebony. The top and bottom surfaces of the board are veneered with ivory and divided into compartments by raised strips. The game board has a drawer used as storage for the gaming pieces: pawns and knucklebones of ivory and casting-sticks of black ebony and white ivory.
