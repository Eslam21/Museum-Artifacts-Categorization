It has two openings for oil. On the sides is an ornament of laurel crown. The oil opening is round. The many lamps found in Alexandria, whether inside or outside tombs, are unique in style. If we look at the history of lamps, we find that the early Greeks used them. Remains of lamps have been found dating from the Mycenaean era. Their use spread in Hellenistic times and a good number were discovered in tombs from the third century BC. Those lamps were made of gold, bronze, glass, and alabaster. However, burnt clay was the most commonly used material. In Roman times lamps were very simple without any decoration. Later, there was more interest in lamp ornamentation. Lamps had various forms: vases, statues, small houses, or human and animal heads. They usually bore the seller's name, the number of hours of lighting for each lamp, or the maker's trademark and were stamped with the name of the maker. In the Christian era, lamps carried raised drawings of the heads of emperors or animals or various forms of crosses \"like the one before us.\" Some lamps bore Christian symbols, symbols of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the letters of his name."}
