Around the base is a painted rectilinear motif with double outline and squared ends, the interior of this motif is divided into segments by several vertical lines within which are dots in varying numbers. Above this is a scene with luxuriant vegetation featuring one small hippopotamus, with its ears, eyes and nostrils indicated by tiny protuberances. A few lines decorate its body. Above the hippo are four schematically rendered birds. In front of the hippo is a large vegetal motif and two more birds around which are double chevrons or zigzags that may represent water or vegetation. Further stalks of vegetation and zigzags fill the rest of the space. The painting seems to portray a Nilotic landscape. The rectilinear motif at the base may represent architecture (some sort of fence or paddock) or perhaps plots of cultivated land. Published: D. Randall-MacIver and A.C.
