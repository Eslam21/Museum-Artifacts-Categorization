Red Nile silt fabric typical of Nile delta and probably made locally. Traces of plaster in the stamp suggest this may have been used to stamp a plaster seal, rather than for bread. Amphora stopper stamp. Such objects are commonly described as cake or bread stamps (Petrie 1886; Bailey 2008). However, such an interpretation is called into question by the presence of plaster in the grooves of many examples found at Naukratis, as if used to stamp the seals of amphora stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). This is confirmed by the presence of a stamp from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. xxix; Bolton Museum 1886.31.35) used to stamp a design on a terracotta disc stopper from the same site (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964) and not bread or cake.
