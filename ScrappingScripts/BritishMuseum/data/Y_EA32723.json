{"artifact_name": "signet-ring", "Object Type": ["signet-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA32723"], "Description": [" Solid gold signet-ring. The bezel bears a representation of a squatting child-king, wearing a pleated garment, bag-wig and adorned with a uraeus. The king sits above the hieroglyphic signs for \"Lord of the Two Lands\", a standard royal epithet. He holds a large feather, symbol of Maat, with a long Shu-feather behind him and an ankh-sign before him. Above him is a sun-disc, flanked by two cobras. The slouching form of this figure, with wide hips, suggests the style of Akhenaten, who maybe the king represented here.
