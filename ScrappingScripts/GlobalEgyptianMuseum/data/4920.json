{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "3923", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "BOAT (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "20.1 cm", "Width": "10.2 cm", "Name": "Model of a ship", "Description": "Models of ships were placed in the tomb in order to enable the deceased to travel freely in the afterlife. Kings were even provided with genuine ships. We must not forget that ships were the principal means of transportation in ancient Egypt. Other models of ships depict the transportation of the mummy to the necropolis. The model shown here is a well-made model of a luxury travelling ship. The prow and stern rise up steeply and their extremities are shaped like lotus flowers. The cabin is an open kiosk where a married couple is sitting at a table laden with food. The ship's crew is now missing its oars, and it is possible that these figures do not originally belong to the model."}
