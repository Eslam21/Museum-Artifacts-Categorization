From John's coat-pocket project papers: 'Secret Intelligence'. Napoleon in his dismay drops his sword and a 'Plan of Operations in the Eas [sic] Indies'. He says: \"Begar Monsieur Jean Bull again!

He wrote to Decr\u00e8s from Bayonne on 17 May 1808 (when the Spanish affair seemed settled): 'There is not much news from India. England is in great penury there, and the arrival of an expeditio would ruin that country from top to bottom. The more I reflect on this step, the less inconvenience I see in taking it.' Rose, 'Napoleon I', 1934, ii. 176. In 1807 (before Tilsit) Napoleon had formed a triple plan for combined land expeditions through Central Asia and Egypt, and a sea expedition round the Cape. 'Camb.
