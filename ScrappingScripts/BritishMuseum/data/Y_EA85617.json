{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85617"], "Description": [" Large, solid clay figurine, almost intact. It is rectangular, flaring out very gently in profile towards the base. The faces are not perfectly flat, but it has been fairly carefully modelled. The base is gently curved and the figure would not have stood upright on its own. The top tapers to a slight projection, the neck, in which is a small hole that might have facilitated the attachment of a head by means of a peg, although it is not a very substantial depression. Certainly, though, a head was once present. On the lower front is a band of dots in two fairly rough rows with a larger central dot that is probably a navel. The dots do not continue around the sides; on one edge there is a depression that is probably incidental. The upper front is very lightly roughened with two slight horizontal ridges in the clay above and it is just possible that breasts have broken away here, but this is far from certain. A chip is missing from an adjacent edge. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica.
