", " Even though no findspot is recorded for this piece, it is possible that it comes from the sanctuary of the Dioskouroi. Already during the first season of work, Petrie reports finds of painted wall plaster belonging to the temple in the sanctuary of the Dioskouroi, describing it as hard and white, with \"painting in chequers of red, blue and yellow\" (Petrie 1886, 40). Further pieces of wall plaster, painted red and blue on a white ground, possibly with some yellow, were found in the temple by Gardner during the second season of work at Naukratis; designs were identified as consisting of a maeaender alternating with stars within squares. Analysis of the pieces by Prof. Middleton showed the red to be pure iron oxide and the blue to be made of \"powdered glass coloured with some salt of copper and then mixed with lime\"; the very fine plaster was found to be \"made of about 3 parts of lime to 1 of finely-ground silica or quarz\" (Gardner 1888, 31, with note 3).
