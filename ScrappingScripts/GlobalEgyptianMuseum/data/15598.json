{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 69409", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING; PAINTED", "Height": "13.3 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of a Harpist", "Description": "On the upper part of this ostracon is a nearly complete drawing of a harpist who plays a large, possibly standing, harp. This drawing is very close to those appearing on the walls of the tomb of Ramesses the Fourth and was possibly a preparatory drawing for a new and similar scene. The artist studied the harp and its decoration but not the way it was actually played, because the harpist's hands appear as if he were playing from the back of the harp's body."}
