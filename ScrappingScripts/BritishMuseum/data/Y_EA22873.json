Small figures of the creature, like this example, always made from glazed composition and differing only in small details from one another, cannot be classed as amulets. They are exclusive to burials of Middle Kingdom date and their exact purpose is far from certain. The hedgehog was an important motif throughout the pharaonic period: its head sometimes appeared at the prow of Old Kingdom funerary boats, and, during the Late Period, cosmetic containers were made in its rotund shape. The creature seems to have had a connotation of rebirth, perhaps suggested by its reappearance after hibernation. It was also a desert dweller, often depicted in scenes of the desert hunt, living outside the fertile Nile Valley in inhospitable conditions. As it had conquered the land of death, it may have been felt it had conquered death itself. Bibliogrpahy: C.
