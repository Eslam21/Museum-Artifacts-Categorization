The box is made around four square-sectioned legs, with glue and tenons used to hold the component pieces of wood together. The front panel, however, was not secured, so could have been removed to allow the contents to be visible. Inside, pieces of wood have been used to create internal divisions. Three smaller compartments (at the back) each contained a vessel, while the front compartment (running along the width of the box) contained the other items. Wooden knobs attached to the front of the box, and the top of the lid, would have allowed the box to be fastened shut.
