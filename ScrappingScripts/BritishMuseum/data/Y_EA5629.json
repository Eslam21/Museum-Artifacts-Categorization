The ostracon is probably an apprentice scribe's copy of the poem, which had been composed over seven centuries earlier. The narrative poem has been the most widely acclaimed masterpiece of Egyptian literature in modern times. It inspired a much translated novel by Mika Waltari (1908-79), 'Sinuhe the Egyptian' (1945), in which the 'Tale' was moved from its original Middle Kingdom setting into the more glamorous Amarna Period; it was also subsequently further reshaped into a Hollywood epic, 'The Egyptian' (dir. Michael Curtiz, 1954), one of whose stars, Peter Ustinov, described the experience as 'like being on the set of Aida and not being able to find the way out'.The novel reflects the author's postwar disillusion with all ideologies, and ends with Sinuhe dying, not in Egypt, but in splendid and despairing isolation, proclaiming that he has 'lived alone, all the days of his life'. The final passage of the original is very different: the hero describes how he returned to Egypt after a life of adventures and misadventures abroad, and regained his position in Egyptian society, with a happy burial.
