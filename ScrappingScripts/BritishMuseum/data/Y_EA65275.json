{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA65275"], "Description": [" Calcite vase: from the front, this vase representing a pregnant woman appears unremarkable. She stands with her bowed legs slightly bent at the knees and her hands brought together above her swollen belly. Her hair, parted in the middle, is drawn back from her face, and her features have been rendered in a rudimentary fashion. The figure becomes more interesting when viewed from the side, as one discovers that the handle of the vase is carved in the form of a naked child clutching either side of its mother's head. The child's features are rather crudely indicated, but the hair is rendered with more detail.
