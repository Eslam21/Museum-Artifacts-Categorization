{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA160"], "Description": [" Limestone tomb-relief Ptahmose: this relief is divided into two registers with figures in sunk relief and incised texts. In the upper register the royal scribe and overseer of the royal harem, Ptahmose, stands with his arms raised in adoration. Eight lines of text contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty on his behalf. The upper part of this register has been lost. In the lower scene the god Anubis stands on the left holding the mummy of the lady Ry. A male figure on the right is pouring a libation over the mummy and behind him stands a lector-priest holding a papyrus roll from which he is doubtless reading the opening-of-the-mouth ritual which is incised above the figures. The surviving portion of the relief has been broken in two and repaired in modern times with the loss of a small part of the upper scene. The surface is badly worn especially at the top and bottom edges. There are traces of green or blue paint in some of the hieroglyphs.
