{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37604"], "Description": [" An hollow terracotta upper-body fragment of Phthonos, the personification of Envy: a male with grotesque features and bald, with his head thrown back, and strangling himself with both hands. There was probably a vertical wound in his abdomen. He wears bracelets and armlets. Holes are bored into his ears: perhaps firing-vents. A pierced suspension-lug was applied behind the neck. The back is modelled. The break has been smoothed below in modern times to enable it to stand. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with a brown surface. Traces of a dressing coloured pink.
