{"artifact_name": "stove", "Object Type": ["stove"], "Museum number": ["1914,0317.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta cooking stove (or brazier) fragment. A pot-support broken from a cooking-stove: a theatre mask of Papposilenos, much injured, the beard support lost, within a rectangular panel with obscure decoration across the top; the upper locks of hair divide in the centre and almost resemble horns. The back is decorated with a deep-sunk panel in which is a bust of a woman in high relief. Her hair is parted in the centre, with bunches high up on each side, falling in low-relief locks beside the neck. She is apparently clothed and may wear a choker necklace. The object has broken away from the rim of the fire-bowl. The front and the back were each made in a one-piece mould and joined: a split between the two pieces is very noticeable in places. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a thick black core and white inclusions. Traces of burning through use.

A parallel in Alexandria has a clear version of the Papposeilenos mask and its surrounding decoration, showing that the upper part is a row of lozenges; it lacks the woman\u2019s bust on the back (Didelot 1998, 297 and 299, figs 30 and 36). For a similar support, with figural decoration both on inside and outside panels, see the Cypriote parallels (Hayes 1991: pl. xvii:11 and 12, with a bull\u2019s head and a lion\u2019s head).
