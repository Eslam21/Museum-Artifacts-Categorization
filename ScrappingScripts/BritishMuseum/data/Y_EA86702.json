{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86702"], "Description": [" Complete seal-impression with two rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side one further rows of a larger size, showing that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica, some salt incrustations can be seen. The clay was hardened after excavation before the rear was cleaned properly. The top part shows the impression of an oval and elongated seal that possibly originates from a ring bezel and there are many finger prints around and on top of the seal impression, squashing quite a lot of the motif. The seal impression is shallow but clearly cut and shows a circumferential band, inside one column of hieroglyphs facing to the left. The most upper sign is illegible, underneath an erected cobra (like I14 but with a shorter tail), on top of a horizontal line that could be an 'n', underneath another illegible sign, right of it a verticalstroke (Z1). Same seal as used on EA86709.
