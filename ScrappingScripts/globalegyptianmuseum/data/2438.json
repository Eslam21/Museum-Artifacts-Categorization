{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1911:376", "Dating": "MENTUHOTEP II/NEBHEPETRE", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF MENTUHOTEP NEBHEPETRE", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "PAINTED; CARVED", "Width": "7.6 cm", "Depth": "9 cm", "Name": "Fragment of painted relief", "Description": "Fragment of limestone relief, with part of the head of a man wearing a plain wig, with cosmetic line around and above the eye clearly marked in delicate carving. Red paint survives over the face, and black on the cosmetic lines. This is part of the wall decoration in the temple to the cult of king Nebhepetra Mentuhotep, who reunited Egypt at the start of the Middle Kingdom c.2025 BC. The fine quality indicates a date late in the reign, when northern, Memphite Old Kingdom relief had a visible influence on royal monuments in the south of Egypt. The head may have been part of a scene of the entourage of the king in court ritual."}
