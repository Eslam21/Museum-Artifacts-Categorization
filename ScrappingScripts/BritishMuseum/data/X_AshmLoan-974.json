", " The rim and interior slip find parallels with Samian Hera cups. However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has a graffito instead. Other similar mugss were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera (Schlotzhauer 2012 116). For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888, 0601.405.
