A. G., Siana Cups I and Komast Cups. Amsterdam 1983, pl.15e, no. 52). Beazley attributes the sherd most probably to the potter Hischylos because of the retrograde inscription on the cup's interior. Hischylos produced cups with bilingual decoration and so Beazley believed this sherd comes from such a cup. While the cup is decorated in the black-figure technique on the interior, there is no extant evidence of red-figure decoration on the exterior of the vase."], "Bibliographic references": [" Beazley & Payne 1929 / Attic Black Figured Fragments from Naukratis (p. 272, no. 61) ", " Venit 1982 / Painted Pottery from the Greek Mainland found in Egypt, 640-450 BC (p. 434, no.
