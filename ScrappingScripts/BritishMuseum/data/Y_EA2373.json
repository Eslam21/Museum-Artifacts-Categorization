{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2373"], "Description": [" Wooden female figure: when it was new, this wooden statuette would have been fully painted to show the two straps of the woman's white dress, perhaps a necklace, and most probably her name, on the base. The figure stands with her feet together and her open hands at her sides. The palms, however, do not face her body, but are turned toward the back in a reverential or prayerful gesture. Her narrow torso, wasp waist, bony hips, and long, swelling thighs represent the ideal of female beauty in the Middle Kingdom. In this case, the effect is fairly natural. It is startling to turn from the stylish, youthful body to its stern, heavy, mature-looking face. The woman's narrowed, hooded eyes and full cheeks indicate that the model for this statue was that of King Amenemhat III.
