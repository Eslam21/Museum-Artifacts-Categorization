Three wavy lines encircle the rim above the handles; hanging down from them are two semi-circular motifs of wavy lines, so-called festoons, arranged in the space between the handles. The third space is filled by a large boat with many oars, a single frond at the left prow and two cabins amidship, one larger than the other. Appended to the smaller cabin is a crescent shaped standard. Below the boat is a group of three long-legged birds (ostriches?). The other boat is placed low on the body, beneath one of the festoons and a handle. This boat appears to be facing toward the right, as the multiple fronds are on the right prow and the crescent shaped standard is appended to the left cabin. This orientation is rare on Decorated ware boat pots. Below the other festoon is a large bird with a speckled body. To the right of this is a bush motif. Published: G.
