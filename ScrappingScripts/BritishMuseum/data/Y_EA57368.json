{"artifact_name": "canopic jar", "Object Type": ["canopic jar"], "Museum number": ["EA57368"], "Description": [" Set of glazed composition canopic jars of Psamtek: these jars have been fashioned from what was originally dark green blue glazed composition in order to contain Psamtek's mummified internal organs which had been removed during the embalming process. Each lid bears the head of the relevant Son of Horus, the four deities who were believed to protect the jars' contents. The falcon-headed Qebhsenuef guarded the intestines, human form Imsety the liver, baboon-headed Hapy protected the lungs and jackal-headed Duamutef the stomach. The hieroglyphic text on each jar contains a protective spell, specifies the respective guardian Canopic deity and names the deceased person whose organ it contained. On the Imsety jar, the name of the owner Psamtek appears to be preceded by the title 'Greatest of Five', i.e. high priest of Thoth at Hermopolis.
