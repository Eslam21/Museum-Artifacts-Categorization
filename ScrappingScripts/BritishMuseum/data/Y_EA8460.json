At the top is a winged sun-disk with uraei. There follows a line of text containing a prayer to Osiris. In the third register below a sky, the deceased stands on the right with arms raised in adoration of Ra-Horakhty, a winged Isis whose wings encircle an 'wedjat'-eye, and the four sons of Horus. Below in the fourth section are three lines of text consisting of a prayer to Osiris on behalf of the doorkeeper of Montu, Lord of southern Heliopolis, Djedmontuiufankh (?), son of ? and (?) of Nyny.
