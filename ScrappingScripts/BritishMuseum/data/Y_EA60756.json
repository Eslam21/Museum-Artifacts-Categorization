{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA60756"], "Description": [" Bronze figure of Isis nursing Horus: there are some cracks in the metal and the tops of the horns are missing on the crown of this stauette. The sun disc and cow's horns identify the subject as Isis, who is accompanied by her son, the young Horus, who sits on her knees. The goddess wears an incised tripartite wig with vulture headdress, decorated with a cobra rather than the usual vulture head. On top of her head, supporting the crown is a modius of cobras. Her dress is Egyptian in style and sheath-like in appearance, and around her neck she wears an incised collar of beads. She holds her left breast with her right hand for her son, who leans back, supported by his mother's left hand. The young god is naked and is identified by the single lock of hair, denoting his youth, on the right side of his head. The tang is beneath the base.

The tang at the bottom of this statue indicates that it would have originally been attached to a base. Bronze figures of deities could stand alone or be part of a group composition. Bronze statuettes of divine family groups became very popular in the Late Period (661-332 BC), and were placed in temples by wealthy individuals. The figures of Isis and Horus symbolised the divine mother and the living king, who succeeded his father, the deceased king Osiris, but both were also important protective deities. Isis was revered for her skills with magic, and Horus, as the child god Harpokrates, had power over dangerous animals.
