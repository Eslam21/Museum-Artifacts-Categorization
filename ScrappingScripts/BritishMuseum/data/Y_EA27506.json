The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of Naukratis provided a wide variety of models of ceremonial instruments and tools. Fourteen were made of copper alloy, ten of stone and four of iron. Six grinders were discovered in the foundation deposits: one upper corn-grinder in the south-east corner and another one in the north-west one; one lower corn-grinders in each corner (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. 26 no. 32-33). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this lower corn-grinder was found at the south-east corner of the pylon. Grinder and grindstone are commonly found in foundation deposits of the Ptolemaic period, continuing a tradition well attested in the Late Period (Weinstein 1973, 297, 307). Petrie, W. M.
