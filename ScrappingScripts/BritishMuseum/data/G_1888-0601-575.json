E.R. Price (East Greek Pottery, 1927, 22) argued that white slip Clazomenian pottery was the link between the Clazomenian sarcophagi, which were covered in a white slip, and the later Clazomenian black figure wares. She explained that the features (the use of white dots as well as the use of white lines together with incised lines for inner details) on the white slip sherds are paralleled either the sarcophagi or the later vases. Cook (1952 note 64) rejected that argument on the basis of both dating and styles. The sherds listed by Price in her arguement and tentatively identified by Cook as British Museum 1888,0601.575 and possibly Oxford AN1896- 1908-G.130.10. A third sherd was mentioned by Price and described as having a cock as decoration. Cook subsequently incorrectly identified the sherd as 1886,0401.1197 which is an Attic Black Figure column krater. His CVA reference is also incorrect because CVA British Museum VIII, pl. 589, no. 9 discusses a Milesian Fikellura amphora. This sherd first mentioned by Price is most likely British Museum 1886,0401.1147 which is a North Ionian black figure stand with the tail feathers of two cocks. In all three cases, the styles are very different, the dates do not match and 1888,0601.575 and 1886,0401.1147 are North Ionian without specification."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B103.12) ", " CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (p. 23, pl.
