The girdle could have been worn by a small woman. It was slipped over the head and arms to rest on the widest part of her hips and to cross the lowest part of her abdomen. It might also have been worn by a dancer to make musical sounds while she danced. Such girdles were commonly depicted on the little dolls of wood or faience often found in the Middle Kingdom tombs."}
