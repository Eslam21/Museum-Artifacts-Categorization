{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68843"], "Description": [" Limestone seated figure, possibly representing a cat, human-headed bird, or sphinx, with the head now lost. The front legs of the figure are the only physical attributes of the animal which are indicated and are depicted parallel and close together against the rest of the body. There is no surviving indication of a tail. Though the front legs appear to rest on the hind paws of the animal, this could alternatively represent a plinth or seat that the animal rests on. There are no further distinguishing marks or features of the figure\u2019s reverse. Aside from the break at the neck, the stone surface has been smoothed and there is minimal damage. The base of the figure is rough and chipped at the front below the animal\u2019s paws.

Some objects may represent a \u2018Libyan\u2019 or \u2018Bastet\u2019 sphinx, representing Libyan influence on Egyptian sculpture of the 1st millennium BC (Gubel 1998; Thomas 2015 includes a list of examples). An example of a human-headed bird figure from the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (AN1896-1908-G.72, image in Thomas 2015) bears a close resemblance to the body of EA 68443, as does an example now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (86.394: https://collections.mfa.org/objects/133593/stauette-of-a-humanheaded-bird?ctx=5d4e0a0b-4aba-4abe-b749-f3287006e1b5&idx=0). Petrie dated these alongside other limestone figures from Naukratis between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886), though one example was found in a level dated to the Ptolemaic Period (ibid.). Hogarth also found one figurine in a \u20185th century BC\u2019 well deposit in subsequent excavations (Hogarth 1905; Hogarth Diary 24-25/04/1903, well 2 bottom). This figure is recorded as being found within the casemate structure at the Great Temenos area at Naukratis (Thomas 2015). Further Bibliography: R.I.
