", " \u2018Corn\u2019 or \u2018palm\u2019 lamps, are contemporary and related to and often conflated with, or a considered a subtype of \u2018frog lamps\u2019, previously thought to date to the 3rd to 4th centuries AD (Bailey 1988, Q2187 to Q2195). Bailey warns that late 2nd or early 3rd century AD \u2018frog lamps\u2019 from Myos Hormos (Whitcomb & Johnson 1982, pl.60dd) and from el-Ashmunein (Bailey 1998, pl.87 X13), suggest these have also been made before the 3rd century AD, though this is probably a later, crude variant (see Bailey 1988, Q2195). Parallels from Quseir (Peacock 2011, nos. 29, 20 and 32) were found in mid 2nd to early 3rd century AD deposits (Van Rengen & Thomas 2006, 149). Parallels from Mons Claudianus were found in deposits dated to the Hadrianic period, or mid 2nd century AD (Knowles 2006, Type nos 27-35). Other examples were also found at Naukratis (British Museum PE 1886,0401.1358 OA4343; Bolton 1886.31.10, and a later variant 1886.31.73). 3rd to 4th century AD parallel from Tell Atrib (M\u0142ynarczyk 2012, type TA III.3).
