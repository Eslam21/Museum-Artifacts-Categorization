{"artifact_name": "votive figure", "Object Type": ["votive figure"], "Museum number": ["EA24377"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta seated naked woman, a beneficent demon, with hands raised in blessing and protection. She wears an oval pendant between her breasts, bracelets and anklets. The head is possibly alien, but comes from a comparable figure, and one close in fabric, both in body and surface appearance. Her hair is elaborately dressed, with braids and loops, and is pulled into a circular bun at the rear. The ears are pierced from front to rear. Summary treatment of the body at the back. Left forearm and hand are lost; the head joined to the body by plaster. A hole is bored underneath, perhaps a firing-vent (there is no other), but enlarged and adapted for a peg on a modern base. Two-piece mould. Body: micaceous brown Nile silt with a grey-brown core and a dark-brown surface. Head: brown Nile silt, with some mica; dark-brown surface.
