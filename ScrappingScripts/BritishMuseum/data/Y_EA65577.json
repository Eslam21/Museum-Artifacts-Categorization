Reisner, who excavated Kerma between 1913 and 1916 and found hundreds of vessels in this ware, thought they must have been made on a wheel. They are entirely handmade - the absence of rilling marks and the slightly uneven rim confirm this. The potter's control of his kiln is second only to the accomplishment of his modelling. Nordstrom suggests that the 'secondary band', which is composed of vitrified material, was produced by a reaction between iron and fluxes in the coating and elements in the clay. It was a deliberately sought-after effect; almost all the vessels have it. On this vessel it appears that a black layer (there are a few accidental spots on the spout) corresponding to the secondary band was painted on to the surface prior to firing. K420 was a subsidiary burial in the great cemetery at Kerma, and the Egyptian pottery and a stone vase found in the grave may be dated to the late Second Intermediate period (1650-1551 BC).
