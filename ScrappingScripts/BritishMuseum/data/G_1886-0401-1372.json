{"artifact_name": "figure-mould", "Object Type": ["figure-mould"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1372"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta mould for a large male head. He has a thick shock of hair, apparently combed forwards from the crown, that comes low over his forehead. His lips are thick and his eyes are closed in sleep or death. Roughly formed, front and back; from the physical appearance of the mould it seems unlikely that there was a mould for the rear of the head. Orange-brown Nile silt with red-brown surface, some fine mica and white inclusions.
