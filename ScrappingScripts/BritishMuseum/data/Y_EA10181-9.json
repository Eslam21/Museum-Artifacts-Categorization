Both sides would claim victory. Two texts, translated from several sources, provide information on the Egyptian perspective of the battle. These are known as the Bulletin and the Poem. The \u2018poem\u2019 of the Battle of Qadesh is a long narrative, at times spoken in first person from the perspective of Ramses II, which describes the battle and subsequent triumph of the Egyptian army. It attributes the victory solely to the efforts of Ramses II with the aid of his father Amun-Ra. Papyrus Sallier III is not the only record of this poem, as it also appears on temple walls at Abydos, Karnak, Luxor, and the Ramesseum, as well as the Papyrus Raif\u00e9, now in the Louvre (E 4889). The beginning of the poem does not survive on the Papyrus Sallier III, which begins at line 65. Some scholars have rejected the categorization of this text as a \u2018poem\u2019, rightly noting that there are no red superscript dots which are typically used in Egyptian poetry to indicate verse or stanza. The language itself is quite elaborate and florid, which may have been why the original designation as a \u2018poem\u2019 was given by early scholars. It is alternatively referred to as \u2018The Literary Record\u2019. General biblio: Kitchen, K. Ramesside Inscriptions 2 Davies, B. 1997. Egyptian historical inscriptions of the Nineteenth Dynasty.
