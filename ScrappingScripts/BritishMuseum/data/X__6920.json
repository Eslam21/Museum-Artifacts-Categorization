", " Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Though there is no direct parallel published in Gorton typology, this miniature scarab could belong to a type which was distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Greece and Punic sites (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI). The combination of hieroglyphs is difficult to interpret as often on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids (Gorton 1996, 93). However, the combination of this three hieroglyphs could be understood as a trigram for writing Amun (see the values for these hieroglyphs in Drioton 1957, 13).
