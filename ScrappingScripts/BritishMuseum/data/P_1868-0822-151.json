Koch, 'Der botanische Nachweis einer Reise Martin Schongauers zur Iberischen Halbinsel', in Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft, vol. 93, 2008, pp. 69-76). Flechsig first suggested that Schongauer may have visited Spain as a youth (Flechsig, Schongauer, Strasbourg, 1944, p. 120) and Koch later published further ideas to support evidence for such a journey ( see A.U. Koch in Weltkunst, no.9, 1993; no.20 1994; and no.10 1998)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hollstein / German engravings, etchings and woodcuts c.1400-1700 (7) ", " Lehrs 1908-34 / Geschichte und kritische Katalog des deutschen, niederl\u00e4ndischen und franz\u00f6sischen Kupferstichs im XV Jahrhundert (V.62.7) ", " Bartsch / Le Peintre graveur (VI.123.7) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Holy Family"], "Acquisition name": ["Bequeathed by: Felix Slade"], "Acquisition date": ["1868"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1868,0822.151"]}
