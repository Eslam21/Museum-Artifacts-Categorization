The base is painted blue to represent the water in which the flower grows.It is a powerful symbol because the lotus flower closes its petals at dusk and opens them again at dawn, facing east to greet the rising sun. Thus, the emerging lotus is the symbol of the sun, which is regenerated each morning after its nightly journey to the regions of the underworld. This beautiful sculpture was placed in the tomb to wish the sovereign eternal life."}
