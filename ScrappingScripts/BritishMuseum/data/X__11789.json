XVIII, no. 80). Although the hieroglyphic signs are quite crudely incised on the scarab, it is possible to recognise the motto \"Bastet gives all good things\", known on other scarabs and scaraboids (see Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 333, pl. 81, no. 720 with additional bibliography), a formula already found in the New Kingdom. The archaising way of writing the nfr-sign could point toward a late copy, maybe of the 25th-26th dynasty. A scarab from Tel Gamma in Palestine, bearing the same motto and presenting a similarly written nfr-sign, has been tentatively attributed to the late 22nd-early 25th Dynasty (ca. 830-700BC) (Keel 2013, 51-52, no. 115).
