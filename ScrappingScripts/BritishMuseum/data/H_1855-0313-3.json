Followers of Sunni Islam, the Ottomans expanded their territories rapidly, capturing Constantinople in 1453. Selim I (\u2018the Grim\u2019, r. 1512\u201320) took Egypt and Syria from the Mamluks in 1517, and campaigns in Iran resulted in a major defeat of their Safavid rivals. Selim\u2019s successor, S\u00fcleyman I (\u2018the Magnificent\u2019, r. 1520\u201366), led Ottoman forces as far west as Vienna, where they were turned back in 1529. The depiction of the galloping, turbaned Ottoman horseman became an image both feared and admired in Europe. It was reproduced on ceramics such as on this majolica dish."], "Bibliographic references": [" Thornton & Wilson 2009 / Italian Renaissance Ceramics: a catalogue of the British Museum collection (cat. 259) ", " Wilson 1987 / Ceramic Art of the Italian Renaissance (158) "], "Location": ["On display (G43/dc1)"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2016 1 Aug - 27 Nov, Zurich, Swiss National Museum, 'The Renaissance' "], "Subjects": ["equestrian"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Turk"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks"], "Acquisition date": ["1855"], "Department": ["Britain, Europe and Prehistory"], "Registration number": ["1855,0313.3"], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 16 Jan 2017 ", " Treatment: 18 Jul 1994 "]}
