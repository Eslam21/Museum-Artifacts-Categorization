{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86766"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression. The fine brown Nile clay with some mica inclusions was hardened after excavation. The rear shows a concave surface with a wood impression like a bolt with the diameter of 3-4 cm. In the break perpendicular to the bolt string impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.3 cm, very similar to S94. The front side is covered with finger-impressions and bears a square impression of a seal. It shows a falcon standing on a nwb-sign, facing to the left, behind him remains of what could have been part of a flagellum? From the surrounding band at the right two lines go off, where maybe cobras were attached as in S94.
