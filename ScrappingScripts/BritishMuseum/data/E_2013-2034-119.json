{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.119"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on a limestone cave wall, showing at least six negative left hand prints in blown black paint. That on the left is the clearest, fingers slightly splayed and pointing left, with a thick black halo and splash marks at the bottom left corner, some superimposing the similarly administered negative print of an unidentified shape, long, narrow and horizontal, which lies between the handprints and tapers towards the left (side-print of a hand?). To the right are three further full hand prints showing fingers, each above the other in a line with the two on the bottom pointing down and that on top pointing left. To the left of these are two smaller prints of closed fingertips, also pointing up and left. The leftmost hand is surrounded by six infilled white circles superimposing the black halo but spattered with black splash marks. To the upper left and the right of the hand are rounded, honeycomb-grid-style motifs, appearing in relief to the right. These are the remains of wasp\u2019s nests. Wadi el-Obeiyd, Egypt.

This limestone cave site is a series of connected caves above the Wadi el-Obeiyd (also spelled el-Obeiyid), north of the Farafra Oasis, in Egypt. The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave has an entrance about 2.5m wide and 2m high with a flat natural lintel which makes it look from a distance as if it is man-made. The cave opens inside with a curved back wall and domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with circular rear wall. Both domed ceilings are smooth except for remains of old wasp nests forming small rough protuberances. The walls are scored by numerous parallel vertical striations and there are stalagmites near the cave entrance. These engravings are on the back wall of the first chamber. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["painted rock art"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.119"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010026 (TARA number) "]}
