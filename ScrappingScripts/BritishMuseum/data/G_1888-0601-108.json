{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.108"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Isis cradling Harpocrates. Isis is lost from the waist up, as also is left side of Harpokrates, but the head of the child survives, showing the hood of his short cloak. Curls show under the edge of the hood, and his left arm is bent with the hand raised. The plinth remains, fairly high, plain and flat-faced, together with the bare feet of Isis. The back is plain and an edge of the circular vent survives. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with grey core, abundant fine gold mica, dung or clay pellets and white inclusions.
