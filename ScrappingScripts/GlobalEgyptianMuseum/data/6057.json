The face is beige, the eyebrows are golden and incised in a chevron pattern, the makeup line extending the eye is golden and joins the blue-green headband at the temples. The contours of the eye and the iris are black, without any particular expression. On this particular mask, the organs are not appliqu\u00e9s. One hundred and seventy masks or fragments thereof were found in the necropolis of Mirgissa/Iken. The practice, attested from the end of the Old Kingdom, appears widespread here, though reserved for wealthy individuals. The conservation of the masks varies considerably, though several have been found almost intact. Although several masks with feminine features have been identified, most bear masculine traits. Some appear relatively stereotyped, but others have more individualised facial features and could potentially be real portraits. A variety of technical details suggests that these masks were actually made at Mirgissa/Iken, and this is confirmed by several archaeological observations."}
