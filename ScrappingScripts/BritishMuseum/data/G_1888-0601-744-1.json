Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-5). This specimen is very close to BM 1888,0601.744.2, maybe from the same master/positive model. Scarabs produced using these moulds would be detailed and of high quality. Gorton, A.
