{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10942"], "Description": [" Papyrus. Early demotic letter. On the recto is the beginning of four lines of text; on the verso is the beginning of two lines of text, followed by a blank space and then traces of an otherwise lost last line (the address?).The text on the recto contains the introduction to the letter, so despite some tears it is certain that the top and right-hand side are intact. It is torn on the left. The text on the verso (written upside down to the text on the recto) shows an upper margin (as well as the right-hand margin), so the fourth line on the recto is presumably the last line on that side. As there is a clear space beneath the second line on the verso and then what remains of a later line, it is likely that that the letter was six lines long with a one-line address.
