{"artifact_name": "shabti", "Object Type": ["shabti"], "Museum number": ["EA65214"], "Description": [" Varnished polychrome wooden shabti: a replica of the mummy, but its colouration, with yellow inscriptions on a black background, is taken from that of contemporary coffins and other funerary objects, a pattern of colouring which became fashionable in the reign of Tuthmosis III. The face is a reddish colour and the entire surface of the figure has been liberally coated with a thick yellow varnish. Although the object can only be a shabti, it has neither the agricultural tools nor the appropriate spell from the 'Book of the Dead'. The inscription is simply the age-old 'hetep-di-nesu' formula.
