A record card accompanying this material says that it was probably excavated by one of the Turner Bequest expeditions to Cyprus between 1893 and 1896. The diagnostic Iron Age material is probably from Amathus as the field notebooks record many items of silver jewellery which were not registered in the 1890s. By contrast, very little silver was recorded by Walters at Kourion in 1895. The far fewer Bronze Age items are probably from Enkomi, particularly the toggle pins. The less diagnostic types, such as simple rings and bracelets, cannot be dated precisely and may have come from either Amathus or Enkomi."], "Bibliographic references": ["Laffineur et al. 1986 / Amathonte III.
