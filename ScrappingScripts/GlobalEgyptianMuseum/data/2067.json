The figure was dated by the excavator, Petrie, to the 3rd Intermediate Period, when full sets of shabtis numbered one for each day of the year, with a further 'overseer' to order each set of ten 'worker' shabtis. The figures were intended to carry out any heavy labour for the deceased in the next life. This example was found at Abydos."}
