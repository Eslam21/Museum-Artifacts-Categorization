{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1912:300", "Dating": "1ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TARKHAN", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "23 cm", "Diameter": "10 cm", "Name": "Cylindrical jar", "Description": "Cylindrical pottery vase, roughly made, with a line around the body below the out-turned rim. This is one of five vase types found in a rich burial at Tarkhan, a rich cemetery of the period around the first recorded unification of Egypt, about 3000 BC. The grave measured 45 by 92 by 55 inches, and yielded in addition to the pottery two stone vessels, and beads of carnelian, gold and lapis lazuli. These goods indicate the relatively high status of the person buried in the tomb: no details of the body were recorded by the excavators, and it had probably been robbed and destroyed in remote antiquity."}
