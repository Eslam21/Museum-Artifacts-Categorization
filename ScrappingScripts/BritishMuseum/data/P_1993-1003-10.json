See 1845-8-9-106 for an impression of St Quirinus (Lehrs 309B). See M. McDonald, 'Ferdinand Columbus: Renaissance Collector, British Museum, London, 2005, no.26. Quirinus is the patron saint of Neuss near D\u00fcsseldorf and Antony was a popular saint who in the same region was called upon in times of need. In 1474/5, Neuss was attacked by troops of Charles the Bold. This print might well have been produced in response to that event, to invoke the protection of these saints."], "Bibliographic references": ["Lehrs 1908-34 / Geschichte und kritische Katalog des deutschen, niederl\u00e4ndischen und franz\u00f6sischen Kupferstichs im XV Jahrhundert (309A)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 2004 Jun-July, Madrid, 'LaCaixa', Ferdinand Columbus 2004 Oct-Dec, Seville, Salon Alto del Apeadero, Ferdinand Columbus "], "Subjects": ["christian saint/martyr"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: St Antony of Egypt"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: British Rail Pension Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1993"], "Acquisition notes": ["This was bought in at Sotheby's, London, 29-30/6/1993, lot 160, where it failed to meet the reserve.
