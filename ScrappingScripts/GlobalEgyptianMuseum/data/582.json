The cylinder base serves as a receptacle for a lamp. The god wears a crown of ostrich feathers. He is brandishing a short sword above his head. In the left hand, he holds an oval shield. The armour with shoulder pads and two rows of pelmets which the god wears is characteristic of the terracottas dating from the end of the first century up to the third century of our era. It seems that Bes as a warrior was particularly revered by the soldiers based in Egypt."}
