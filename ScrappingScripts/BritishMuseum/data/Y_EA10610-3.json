Papyrus written on the recto in linear hieroglyphic script, containing the text of a liturgy in honour of Senwosret I (the so-called Ramesseum Dramatic Papyrus), illustrated with vignettes. The text is written in vertical columns with titles and some text in horizontal lines, possibly in retrograde script. This frame contains lines 64-84. The papyrus was a full-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparenly belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fizwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
