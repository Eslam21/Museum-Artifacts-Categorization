The surviving examples probably all come from tombs. The kneeling posture might indicate the piety of the deceased; it is less easy to explain the position of the arms, tightly enclosed in a cloak, although an image of similar form, named the tekenu was included in the funeral procession at \u00c3\u00a9lite burials."}
