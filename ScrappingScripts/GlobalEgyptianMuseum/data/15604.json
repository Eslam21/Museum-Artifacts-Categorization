{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63795", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING; PAINTED", "Width": "13.1 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of Man in Front of a Bull", "Description": "This sketch shows the attempt of an artist to draw a colored bull, a symbol of strength in ancient Egypt. The artist showed his familiarity with the character and appearance of this powerful animal. He included details of the coloring of the bull's hide, the hair of its tail, and the horns. To the right of this sketch, there is a figure of a man wearing a kilt standing and holding a staff in his left hand. The artist again included details of the man's body and hairstyle and the man's kilt with fine lines. The man's figure is thought to be a later addition or part of another artistic composition because of the distance between the bull and the man and the lack of a rope between them."}
