", " Pierkarski takes this sherd to come from a krater, but could it possibly come from a lekane, where animal friezes are common? Comparison with a lekane attributed to the KX Painter (Athens NM 296; ABV 24, 7; Boardman ABFV 1974, p. 26 fig. 19) shows a goat (no image of a ram by the KX Painter has yet been found) with a long red neck, similar use of double incised lines (admittedly common at the period) for the shoulder and elbow and on the horn; the lion's red mane separated from its eye by two incised lines is similar to what remains of the lion on the Bonn fragment. The comparison to Sophilos is not as convincing: Sophilos's animals have short necks, the ram has a scalloped horn and the elbows are not defined in the same way. ", " See also D.
