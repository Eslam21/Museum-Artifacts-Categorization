{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2133", "Dating": "MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC", "Archaeological Site": "ARMANT", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN", "Height": "14 cm", "Width": "6.25 cm", "Name": "Levallois point", "Description": "This elongated, pointed flint flake was created using the Levallois technique (so-called after the site Levallois-Perret near Paris), a typical flaking technique dating from the Middle Palaeolithic Period (in Egypt from roughly 100,000 - 45,000 years ago). This complex stone-working technique involves the upper surface of a stone core being worked in such a way that the form and size of the intended flake can be determined in advance. The Levallois point illustrated here was not retouched any further. It was perhaps used as the point of a spear."}
