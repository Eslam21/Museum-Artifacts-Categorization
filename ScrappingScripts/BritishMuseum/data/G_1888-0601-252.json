Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. The sherd comes from the same cup as British Museum 1888,0601.241 and probably 1965,0930.691 and 1965,0930.692.
