{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "6125", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FALSE DOOR", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "74 cm", "Width": "49.5 cm", "Depth": "13.5 cm", "Name": "False door of Ankhet", "Description": "The false door inside the tomb chapel or the cult chamber is the architectural expression of the link between the deceased and the mortuary cult. Inside the superstructure of the mastaba lies a closed chamber behind the false door, in which a statue serves as a vehicle for the soul in the tomb. The offering ritual is carried out in front of the false door. The conventional components of the false door are as follows: there is an inner and an outer tripartite door frame, and a miniature doorway represented in between the jambs with a rolled-up mat hanging in its opening. In between the inner and outer lintels of the stela is a representation of the deceased in front of an offering table. In the present case, the outer door frame has an added cavetto cornice and a torus moulding which is itself enclosed by yet a third door frame. All three frames have inscriptions containing the conventional offering formula with the name of the deceased. Virtually all of the bottom ends of the jambs carry representations of the deceased in relief. She is the lady Ankhet, with the \"beautiful name\" of Mut-sherit, which can be translated as \"small mother\"."}
