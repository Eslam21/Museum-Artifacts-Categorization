{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.58"], "Description": [" Terracotta male figure on horseback. The rider is lost from his waist up, and the horse is considerably damaged: the head and most of the neck are gone, much of the surviving foreleg and rear leg are missing: the group has split away at its join with its left side, and only the right side remains. The man has a gigantic phallus that slopes down towards the horse\u2019s chest, and he rests his right hand on its root. He wore a garment that reached almost to his knees, and appears to have had boots with down-turned tops. Part of the harness survives, the rein and a strap over the horse\u2019s neck. In front of the rider is a shallow recess, cut out after moulding, that presumably held something now lost. From a two-piece mould, the two pieces would have been joined, one side since lost. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with a grey-brown core and white grits. Traces of a white dressing. Details of the harness are in red-brown paint, with dark pink on the flesh of the rider, and dark-red paint on his garment: very little of the paint remains.
