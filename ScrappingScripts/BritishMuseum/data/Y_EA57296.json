Raised rim round the filling-hole, with hinge-pieces at the rear holding a scallop-shell-shaped lamp-lid. Ring-handle with a small thumb-stub at the rear, above which is a handle-ornament in the form of a large crucifix. The lamp stands on a raised circular base, flat below, with a socket for the spike of a lampstand in its centre. The sleeve of the socket, of tapering angular shape, rises inside the oil-chamber. Surface colouration: patchy green, with large areas of iron staining, and lumps of iron corrosion.
