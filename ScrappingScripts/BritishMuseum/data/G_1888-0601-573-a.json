Mommsen (Bonn): Sample NAUK 11 and the fabric was identified as a chemical singleton. Although the origin of the sherd has not been determined, the decorative style and techinque are typically Vroulian. It may eventually be determined that the fabric originated from an as yet unknown Rhodian production centre. the style of the sherd places it within Kinch's Group B 1.\u03b1 or Group B 1.\u03b2 of Vroulia cups. It is impossible to determine to which of the two groups the cup belongs since the defining characteristic is found on the underside of the stemmed foot, which is now lost. For parallels regarding the decoration, see British Museum 1888,061.569.e. If the sherd belongs to a similar cup, then it ought to be placed amongst the earliest Vroulia examples at Naukratis because of the geometric pattern in the handle zone and because the shape of the cup shares similarities with his South Ionian cup Type 8, which coincides with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian cup type A1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88) and Hayes' Ionian cup type III (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116).
