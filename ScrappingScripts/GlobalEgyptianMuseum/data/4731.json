{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "18", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "13.4 cm", "Width": "10.4 cm", "Depth": "14.8 cm", "Name": "Head of man with a fringe of hair", "Description": "This head of a statuette depicts a balding man with a fringe of hair. The broad face has large round eyes, a wide nose and full lips. The large ears have been naturalistically carved. Short curly locks cover the back and the sides of the head. The back pillar ends in a truncated triangle and reaches up to the lower part of the skull. This type of modelling is typical of non-royal heads from the third century BC. However, here an attempt has also been made to emphasise the linear, a characteristic of the first century BC. This suggests a date somewhere in the second century BC."}
