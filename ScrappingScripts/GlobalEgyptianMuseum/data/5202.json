{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "6128", "Dating": "1ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "BED", "Material": "CEDAR", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "18 cm", "Width": "58 cm", "Name": "Bed frame", "Description": "Two long round poles are connected by two shorter ones, with carrying handles shaped like stylised lotus flowers at the ends. The legs are shaped like ox legs. They are attached by pegs and were secured with strips of leather, traces of which can still be seen. On the inside of the poles are two rows of slits facing each other. The ends of leather straps were slotted into the slits, and were then woven in a criss-cross pattern to form a surface to lie on. The bed base is unusually short. This may be because it was used for a dead body in a curled position. Similar frames have been found in tombs at Tarkhan (1st Dynasty)."}
