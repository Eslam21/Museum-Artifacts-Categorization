This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Robinson lists the cup as coming from the Sanctuary of Hera but Fairbanks mentions only Naukratis (published in Fairbanks 1928, 220, pl. 37, no 337). The shape of the cup is typical of Hera Cups from this period. However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has none. Other similar cups were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera. Despite this, both the crude slip and rather coarse fabric are typical of Hera cups and so the cup may have been produced on Samos. As Schlotzhauer points out, if the cup does indeed come from the Sanctuary of Hera, it provides evidence that it was not a requirement that all cups of this shape which were then left as votives to Hera should have a dedication to the goddess.

Following Furtw\u00e4ngler's typology of Samian Hera cups, the sherd possibly belongs with his Type I-III (Furtw\u00e4ngler 1989 88, fig. 14).
