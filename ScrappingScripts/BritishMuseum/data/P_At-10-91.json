Lit.: N. Turner, 'Italian Drawings in the BM, Roman Baroque Drawings', London, 1999, I, no. 144(91) Turner 1999 Danuta Batorska pointed out that this is an early study for the decoration of the right-hand wall of the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the Cathedral at Tivoli, usually dated 1656 (Batorska, 1976, pp. 169-71, pl. 41). Isabella Lodi-F\u00e8 has suggested the decoration may have been done the year before, based on an autograph annotation by Grimaldi, kept in the Anonymous Biographer's manuscript at Bologna, which states that in May 1655 Grimaldi received 600 scudi \"per la cappella di Tivoli\". As further evidence for this earlier dating, she cites the facts that Grimaldi does not appear in the 'atti' of the congregationi (meetings) of the Accademia di San Luca from November 1654 to May 1655 and is known to have worked on the frescoes in the Quirinal Palace, Rome, from May 1656 to July 1657.
