This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The EEF distribution list states this piece to be manufactured in grey limestone. However, it looks more like soapstone or steatite. A few amulets in similar material were found in Naukratis, all representing Egyptian gods. They share details in the manufacture and style: Montreal, Redpath Museum 2507; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.86.326 and 86.184; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.684 (also figure of Nefertum) and AN1888.173; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2267. It is plausible that they were produced locally. Baboons were the 'animal manifestation of the moon god' Thoth (Andrews 1994, 90). Amulets of Thoth were supposedly worn by scribes since Thoth was their patron. On baboon amulets: Andrews 1994, 27, 90; Herrmann et al. 2010, 99.
