{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "43", "Dating": "UNKNOWN", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "EROTIC FIGURINE", "Material": "CLAY; POTTERY", "Technique": "BURNED", "Name": "Reclining woman", "Description": "Nude woman reclining on her back on a broad bed. This type of nude female, often found as part of the tomb equipment, does not have an erotic character but is rather cold and serious. The exaggerated genitals and the full hips suggest that they were fertility symbols. Their traditional label of \"concubine\" is the result of looking only from a male point of view. After all, many of these figures were found in the tombs of women."}
