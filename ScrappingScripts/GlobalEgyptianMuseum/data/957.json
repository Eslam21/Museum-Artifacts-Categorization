Very characteristic is the flat head, emphasized by the  headdress in the form of a bag, also attested in contemporary reliefs. In the crossed hands, the shabti is holding a pair of hoes. The shoulders support two square sacks. The hieroglyphic text engraved in the hard stone in six horizontal lines contains Chapter 6 from the Book of the Dead. The shabtis of king Taharqa are distinguished by the high number found in his pyramid (1070), by their material (granite, green serpentine and alabaster) and by the quality of their manufacture."}
