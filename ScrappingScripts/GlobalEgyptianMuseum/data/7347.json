The title and the name are framed here by a series of prophylactic signs: alternating Ankh signs (\"life\") and djed-pillars (\"stability\"), a rather rare mofit. The seal belonged to the \"First sword (following the strong arm, Pepi)\". This was a military title of a rather high rank, that is to say the best warrior of the warriors of the class of the \"shemesou\", which proves that this category of personnel also exerted administrative offices.
