This is actually confirmed by the archaeological context in which it was found. It is pierced (at the intact extremity) by two holes, allowing for the string of beads of the necklace to be suspended. One of its large and flat surfaces is simply adorned with sketchy motifs traced in a dark blue paint: two identical rectangles used to subdivide the surface crosswise, each completed with two dotted lines framing a wavy line."}
