The different ages listed on either side are not a mistake, but may be due to a turn of phrase in expressing ages in demotic. Namely that the phrase used can be translated as 'in their X year'; where being in the first year of life is counted from birth to age 1. So the deceased was 15 in the Greek language, but in her 16th year in demotic. For more on this see Arlt 2011, 114-16. Published in: Regulski, I. (ed.), 2022.
