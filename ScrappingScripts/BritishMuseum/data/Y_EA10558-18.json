{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10558,18"], "Description": [" Book of the Dead of Ankhwahibra, frame 18: the vignette shows the judgment hall. The roof is supported by columns, and Osiris sits enthroned as judge, under a canopy. Before him are the forty-two assessors in two rows, probably intended to be seated along the walls of the hall. The dead man appears twice, adoring each group. The main action of the scene is the weighing of the heart. Anubis and Horus tend the balance, while Thoth with his scribal palette and pen records the outcome. It is favourable to Ankhwahibra for he appears with arms upraised in jubilation, supported by Maat, the goddess who personified the concept of Right and Order. The Devourer Ammit, once again cheated of her prey, sits on a pedestal facing Osiris.
