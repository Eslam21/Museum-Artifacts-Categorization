{"artifact_name": "lid", "Object Type": ["lid"], "Museum number": ["EA86138"], "Description": [" Fragment of a large lid of a stone vessel made of white limestone, broken into two fragments and glued. Parts of the lid are broken off. The upper and underside are flat and well smoothed, the lip is 1.1 cm wider on both sides than the base, with a well defined ridge. The top is decorated with a floral depiction drawn in black lines. The centre consists of a circle from which the leaves span out. The outlines of the leaves were filled in by a substance that is now recognisable as a lighter whitish colour than the background. It seems that the lid was reused as it was cut into halves in a straight line while the circular outer edge shows notches on the upper and lower side in an irregular pattern around the object, probably wear marks from strings for the reuse as a weight or tool.
