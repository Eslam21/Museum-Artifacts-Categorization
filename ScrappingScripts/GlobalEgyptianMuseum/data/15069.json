They are made of stuccoed gilded wood in the form of sacred animals whose eyes are inlaid with colored glass paste. These beds may have been intended to bear the deceased king during his journey to his eternal destination in the afterlife.One bed has the head of Hathor, the celestial cow; the second, the head of a lioness; and the third, shown here, is a composite animal with a hippopotamus's head wearing a wig, a leopard's body, and a crocodile's tail and crest.This strange combination represents the dreadful Ammut, the monster who waits during the final judgment in the court of Osiris and who devours the unjust deceased."}
