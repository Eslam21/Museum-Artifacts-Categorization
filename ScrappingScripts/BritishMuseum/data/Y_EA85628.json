{"artifact_name": "stopper", "Object Type": ["stopper"], "Museum number": ["EA85628"], "Description": [" Object made of fired very sandy clay that sheds a lot of particles. The shape is that of a top with a lower part that is round running into a rounded point, roughly triangular in section. From the widest part a thinner short stud protrudes that is rounded at the top. The lower part is red from oxidation, the upper part is black and was therefore covered during the firing process. The function is difficult to determine, maybe a jar stopper?
