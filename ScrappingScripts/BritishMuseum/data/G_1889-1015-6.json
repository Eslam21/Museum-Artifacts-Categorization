Christian to A.S. Murray dated 8 June and 18 June 1889 (GR Archives Original Letters; see also Murray's comments in his letter to C. Christian of 15 July (GR Archives Letter-Book 1880-96, fol. 185). All the items in this registration group are described as coming from Mari, but in the letter of 8 June, 1889, only the cylinder seal in this group is given a findspot (Moni, which may actually mean Maroni as all three names were commonly confused at this time). The curse tablets in this accession group almost certainly came from elsewhere, probably Amathus, as one of the selentite fragments joins a piece in the collection bought from Captain Handcock in 1891 (GR 1891,4-18.1-59)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Jewellery / Catalogue of the Jewellery, Greek, Etruscan, and Roman, in the Departments of Antiquities, British Museum.
