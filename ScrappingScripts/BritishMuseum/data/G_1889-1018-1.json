{"artifact_name": "painting", "Object Type": ["painting"], "Museum number": ["1889,1018.1"], "Description": [" Framed wooden panel with a painted portrait in tempera. The portrait is badly damaged, with more than half of the paint flaked and missing. What remains is part of the face and the shoulders of a woman dressed in a pink tunic and wearing pearl earrings. The morticed frame is in good condition, and still preserves the cord (of palm fibre) by which the portrait was suspended. A grooved channel at the front of the frame suggests it originally had a protective cover, now missing.
