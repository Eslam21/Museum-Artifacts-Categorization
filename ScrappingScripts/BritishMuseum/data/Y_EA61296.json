{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA61296"], "Description": [" A large hollow terracotta standing figure of Bes, armed: sword-arm raised high, wielding a sword, oval Gaulish shield held to his left side. He wears a light Macedonian cuirass over a tunic, tied over the belly, and curving down low to each side; there is a double row of pteryges above the bottom edge of the tunic. He has a high feathered crown surmounted by a naos of the Bull Apis, with an architrave decorated with a disc and two uraei, and a cobra cornice, summarily rendered, above. The bull walks to right and has a disc between the horns. The back of the figure is plain except for the mane, marked by incision in the archetype. The feet, the backs of the legs and the plinth are restored in plaster. Two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with some mica.
