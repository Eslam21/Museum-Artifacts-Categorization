{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.30"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on rock face showing eleven human and two quadruped animal figures, and one unidentified object. The human figures are all upright and range in colour from light to dark brown. At the top centre are three small figures in light brown, apparently in motion and pointing right. They appear to be wearing skirts except for that in the centre, which has a long horizontal line in the same pigment extending back from the head. To the lower right of these is a larger figure in darker brown pointing right with legs extended as if seated and the left hand on the hip. To the right of this is the faded stick-figure style figure of an undientified quadruped in light brown facing left, superimposed by a walking figure facing right. To the right of this is a figure facing left from which two smaller figures, also facing left, emerge. There are two large figures in the centre of the image, facing right. They are both gesticulating and the most clearly delineated, on the far left, is depicted in a leaping motion with arms extended and legs split and bent at the knee. The head is large and round as is that of the next to the right. The other figures are faded with unclear delineation. The largest figure appears to superimpose a very faded quadruped (cow with udder?), upright and facing right and cut off the edge of the image at the trunk. To the upper left is an unidentified shape with six straight lines emanating up from it. To the left of this is an unidentified infilled shape with long protuberances at the bottom, bovid, cattle/caprine - not clear due to superimpositions. and below this is the tiny figure of a equid-like quadruped with long thin legs (giraffe?) facing right. To the lower left is an unidentified shape with six straight lines emanating up from it, and to the right a gazelle. Karkur Talh, Egypt.

This site is in the west bank of a blocked wadi which one flowed into the wadi with the waterfall site 2013.2034.1-4. A crude shelter with a rough solid-rock floor about 6m wide and 25m deep; just over 1m high. Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " cattle ", " garment "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh ", " Topographic representation of: Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.30"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYKTA0030004 (TARA number) "]}
