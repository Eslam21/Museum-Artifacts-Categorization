Since he is called Germanicus, the inscription certainly dates to post-AD 83, when this title was awarded to him, and because his 15th consulship is mentioned we can more securely date it to AD 90/91. Domitian was the only emperor to take the censorate for life, as it is labelled here. Immediately noticeable and of particular interest is the double erasure of names on this slab. Erasing names from inscriptions was part of the damnatio memoriae, the \u2018condemnation of the memory\u2019, a punishment that could be handed out by the emperor or Senate. The first erasure to have happened here was that of the name of the Prefect of Egypt, Marcus Mettius Rufus, by order of Domitian himself (we do not know why). Mettius Rufus, who was even mentioned by Suetonius (Suet. Dom. 4), was prefect there between AD 89 and mid-AD 91, which means his name must have been erased very shortly after the stone was set up. Ironically Domitian suffered the damnatio memoriae himself after his murder (in all, over 30 emperors would suffer this fate), so his name was erased as well, in or shortly after AD 96. Despite this, the monumental inscription remained standing by the bridge it commemorated. (Booms 2016, 68-69) Bibliography: - W.M.F. Petrie (1896) Koptos. London, 26-7. - Booms, D.
