Wife of Ptah and  mother of Nefertem,  this goddess of Memphis,  whose name signifies \"The Mighty\", was sent to earth to destroy the enemies of her father Re. Presenting herself most often under the disguise of a lioness, Sakhmet was capable of generating diseases, but also of treating them. It's for this reason that the image of the goddess, who also was the patron of medicine is carried as an amulet."}
