{"artifact_name": "stamp", "Object Type": ["stamp"], "Museum number": ["EA16233"], "Description": [" An oval stamp with a stallion in relief to left (right in an impression), with a foreleg raised and a long high-arched tail. At the rear is a pinched-in grip, pierced from side to side. The side view is reminiscent of a finger-ring of Ptolemaic shape. Solid; the design may have been carved, or formed by pressing into a mould. Abrasions and wear in many areas. Orange-brown Nile silt with many white inclusions; buff-brown surface. The face is varnished, presumably in modern times.
