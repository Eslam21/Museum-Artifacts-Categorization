On the upper part of the slab there are two crosses with a cross within a circle between them. It is probable that the slab originally bore the name of the deceased and the date of his death, which was usually given as just the day and the month, in addition to some supplications. Tombstones provide us with the names that were used at that time and also with the sort of jobs that people had."}
