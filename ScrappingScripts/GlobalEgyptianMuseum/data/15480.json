{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 91337", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "18.8 cm", "Name": "Statue of a Standing Ptah", "Description": "The god Ptah was considered the guardian deity of artists and artisans. He is identified by his headdress, a tight smooth cap. Ptah's body is wrapped in a mummy-shaped cloth that only leaves his hands uncovered. He holds in his hands the \"Djed\" sign and the \"Was\" scepter that touches the false beard. The peculiarity of Ptah's beard is its shape; it is not curved, as are those of other divinities, but straight like that worn by the pharaoh. It might be thought that the sovereign took this attribute from Ptah, as he was the main god in Memphis, the kingdom's most ancient capital. A broad necklace adorns the cloak and widens to its full extent across Ptah's shoulders. The statue rests on a small square base."}
