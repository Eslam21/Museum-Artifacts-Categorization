", " The commodity's name is not fully visible on Balog's specimen and he read al-\u0101s, myrtle, a plant to which the pharmacopoeias ascribe various medical properties, but which would not have been one of the items of mass consumption for which, by our hypothesis, stamped measures were used. Mishsh is well attested on the stamps. In either case the reading is not free from difficulty. For al-\u0101s the form of l\u0101m-alif is very curious while for al-mishsh it has to be assumed that m\u012bm is elongated until it does look like l\u0101m. Another error in the legend is the surplus 'tooth' in \u02bfUbayd.
