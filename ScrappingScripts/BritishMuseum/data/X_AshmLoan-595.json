", " Price describes the feet as those of a bird but they seem more closely related to felines and sphinxes. For a parallel see Lemos 1991, no. 675 from Pitane. Lemos describes this sherd as in the light and dark technique. The vase was first slipped white, then black, followed by painted decoration using added red and added white. Whilst the technique is commonly found on the interior of Chian open vessels, it is not frequently found on the exterior surface of vases. Thus this sherd stands out as one of a small number of Grand Style vases created using the light and dark technique. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
