{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 23925", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "SCHIST", "Technique": "POLISHED; HEWN", "Height": "27 cm", "Name": "Roman Bust of Serapis", "Description": "The Roman bust of Serapis is derived from a Hellenistic model. The usual locks of hair are arranged side to side instead of falling on the forehead. He wears a necklace and a tunic, and he is draped with a mantle, or cloak, that covers his shoulders.This bust is different from the other portrayals of Serapis. A small disk is visible in the center of a headband with a high hairstyle decorated with a floral bough, instead of the traditional modius, a turban-shaped measure of grain symbolizing fertility. The link between Serapis and the sun god Helios is obvious here. However, a Serapis-Dionysos link is also evident from the two horizontal wings on his hair."}
