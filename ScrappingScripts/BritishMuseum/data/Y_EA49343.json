Eight right-facing horizontal lines of blue-painted hieroglyphs are inscribed around the front of the body. Blue paint survives on the wig, and black and red details on the eyes and flesh. Renseneb holds an ankh sign ('life') in one hand, and in the other a vase (\u1e25s) that can be read as 'favour'. The hieroglyphs are mutilated: the birds and figures lack their lower parts and legs.
