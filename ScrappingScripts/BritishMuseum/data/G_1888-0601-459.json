However, this sherd belongs to the same vessel as British Museum 1888, 0601.499.e, 1924,1201.20, 1888,0601.460.e, 1888,0601.460.f and 1888, 0601.460.g which clearly show that it is a dinos with at least four friezes. Williams notes that Chian Wild Goat Style dinoi sherds are often mistaken for oinochoai because of the lack of slip on the interior surface. Lemos describes the sherd as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration (Lemos 1991, 72-3). It should also be pointed out that Lemos describes the sherd as part of the Group of the Aphrodite Bowl, rather than as by the painter of the bowl, because the sherd displays a greater amount of variety in the filling ornaments, albeit similar to those on the Aphrodite Bowl (Lemos 1991, 74-5). However, the filling ornament on this dinos is not as expertly and evenly executed as that on the Aphrodite Bowl. In both instances, the interior decoration scheme is similar on both sherds and it ought to be repeated that this dinos, as well as other Wild Goat Style dinoi, lack interior decoration."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
