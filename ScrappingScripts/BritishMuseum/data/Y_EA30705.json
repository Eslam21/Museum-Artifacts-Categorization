They are normally made in Egyptian blue, like here. The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. Pegasus, represented on the base, is one of the most famous mythical creatures of the Greek mythology. Such Hellenising motifs are popular on scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis. This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, see especially C14 for this piece).
