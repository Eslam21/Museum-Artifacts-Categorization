{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-jar", "Object Type": ["cosmetic-jar"], "Museum number": ["EA2572"], "Description": [" Steatite cosmetic-jar: the container takes the form of a kneeling girl who holds before her a footed jar, a characteristic shape for vessels of the Middle Kingdom. Her head is shaven, except for a plait down the back at the end of which is depicted a fish pendant or 'nekhau', in the shape of a 'Tilapia' or 'bolti'. The girl's only garment is a long skirt from waist to ankles, over which, around her hips, she wears a girdle formed from cowrie shells strung between beads.

Because of its fancied resemblance to the female genitalia, the cowrie, whether of real shell or imitated in precious metal or semi-precious stone, came to form an element of girdles and could thus be worn as close as possible to the anatomical area it was thought to protect. Superb girdles with hollow cowry elements made of gold or electrum are a feature of contemporary royal female jewellery. The narrowness of the mouth of the pot shows it was intended to hold eye paint. Though it came from a tomb, this object was first used during the owner's life: the top is scratched by the constant removal and replacement of the lid, which is now lost. Bibliography: H.
