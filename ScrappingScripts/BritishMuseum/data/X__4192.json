", " Falcon bronzes are usually associated with Horus (Weiss 2012, 281-282), though several deities and the pharaoh himself are linked with this form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54). This amulet belongs to the type T 18 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss, a type otherwise attested in the Memphite region, Herakleion and Athribis (Weiss 2012, 738-740, Pl. 43c-f, Typ T 18, see esp. Nr. 805 for this specimen). Amulets in the shape of a falcon, sometimes crudely made like this specimen, were manufactured in a number of materials. Many examples of falcon wearing a double crown of Egypt, made out of lead, were discovered in Herakleion-Thonis (Heinz 2011, 216-217, fig. 4). Numerous amulets of falcons, made out of glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis, including rather large amuletic figures in glazed composition likely produced locally (Masson forthcoming).
