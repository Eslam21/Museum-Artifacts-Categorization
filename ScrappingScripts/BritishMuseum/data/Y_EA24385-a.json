{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA24385,a"], "Description": [" Red quartzite figure of Senebtyfy: standing with his left foot advanced and his arms at his sides. His head is slightly raised, an unusual feature. His upward gaze may be related to the fact that his hands are not fisted, but held open in reverence; the image is one of worshiping the god in whose temple this statue was placed. Senebtyfy's expression may seem more quizzical than serious, but his face is still a very much simplified version of Amenemhat III, with oval, heavy-lidded eyes, broad cheeks, and a full, rather prominent chin. The long kilt is another of the enveloping garments favored by the men of the Middle Kingdom. Wrapped around Senebtyfy's body with its corners tucked in at the top, it covers him from breast to calf. Garments like these were stored folded, in chests from which, being linen, they emerged well creased. The sculptor has meticulously depicted these folds, showing the sharp inner creases as a single line and the softer outside folds with a double line.
