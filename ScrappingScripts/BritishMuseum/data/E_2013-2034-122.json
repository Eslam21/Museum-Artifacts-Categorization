The hand print is surrounded by six infilled white circles superimposing the black halo but spattered with black splash marks. To the upper left and the right of the hand are unidentified rounded, honeycomb-grid-style motifs appearing in darker colour at the top left, lighter colour superimposing the hand and in white raised relief to the right.

This limestone cave site is a series of connected caves above the Wadi el-Obeiyd (also spelled el-Obeiyid), north of the Farafra Oasis, in Egypt. The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave opens on the inside with a curved back wall and a domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with a circular rear wall. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["painted rock art"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.122"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010030 (TARA number) "]}
