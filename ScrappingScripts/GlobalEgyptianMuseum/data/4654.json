{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "146", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY (not before); 13TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; ENGRAVED", "Height": "25 cm", "Width": "18 cm", "Depth": "4.3 cm", "Name": "Stela of An-yotef", "Description": "Tall rectangular stela with a rounded top. The shape of the stela is irregular, it being wider at the top than at the bottom. The curve also extends further on the right. A simple incised line frames the section with the images on three sides; at the bottom the inscriptions run over the edge of the stone. There are no representations. Instead, there is a text of thirteen horizontal lines, all separated by simple incised lines except the last two lines. The signs are rather deep and still show traces of blue pigment. In general this is a well executed piece of work."}
