{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 30764", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ABU RAUWASH", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS OF BIRD", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "4 cm", "Width": "3.5 cm", "Name": "Falcon's Coffin", "Description": "From the Late Period on, falcons were mummified by the thousands and buried in the sacred animals' necropolises with or without other animals. Bronze boxes like this one were used to house the falcon mummies and were usually decorated with a falcon figurine at the top. The falcon is depicted standing and wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, which was originally decorated with a uraeus, or the sacred serpent, that is now missing. The facial features are roughly executed, and the artist has over-emphasized the falcon's long tail and its strong talons."}
