{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.18"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a female worshipper standing. Lower part of a draped standing woman. There are larger parts broken off all over the surface. The figure is very flat, the garment falling straight down, there is a bundle of six very narrow, parallel folds at the centre. The back is unworked and slightly curved, the section oval. Painted white with a red stripe on either side. Carved from grey limestone, painted. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Cypro-Archaic II"], "Production date": ["600BC-560BC (circa)"], "Production place": [" Made in: Cyprus "], "Excavator/field collector": ["Excavated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Findspot": [" Excavated/Findspot: Sanctuary of Apollo (Naukratis), Stratum A\u03a04 ('bothros' / 'trench with bowls') (Attributed by Petrie to the 'first temple of Apollo'.) "], "Materials": ["limestone"], "Type series": ["Nick type 2 (2.1d)"], "Technique": [" painted ", " carved "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 41.80 centimetres (max) ", " Width: 19 centimetres (max) "], "Curator's comments": ["The discovery is described by Petrie: 'A very pretty archaic limestone statuette was found ; & a fragment of a statue in limestone about half life size, only just the drapery around the legs, a smooth mass of this section with grooving down the front, representing the folds of the edge of the garment. It might almost be mistaken for a piece of architectural moulding' (Petrie journal 1885, 202). This was found in context A\u03a04 from the bothros of the sanctuary of Apollo, dated c.600BC-560BC. Published (Smith, no. 103; Knackfuss in Milet, I, 2, p. 88/112; Mallet, Premiers Etablissements, p. 260, fig. 51; V. M\u00fcller in Ath. Mitt., 1919, p. 42; Poulsen in Jahrbuch, 1906, p. 198, n. 151). Nick (2006, 64) puts the figure in the context of Yon's type I C (Yon 1974). Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
