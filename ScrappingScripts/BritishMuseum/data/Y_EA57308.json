{"artifact_name": "lamp-stand", "Object Type": ["lamp-stand"], "Museum number": ["EA57308"], "Description": [" Brass pricket lampstand with three rounded feet and short legs supporting a flaring lower element decorated with horizontal grooves. The lower circumference has six knobs, one above each leg and the others spaced equidistantly between them; each leg is strengthened by a strut behind it. At the top of the lower element is a baluster holding the shaft, which apparently extends right through the lower element, showing as a knob on its underside. The shaft, which thickens in the middle and tapers again to its top, is seven sided. At the top is another baluster, holding the pricket; the latter tapers from a rounded section to square. Heavily corroded. Surface colouration: patchy dark and light green, with large turquoise-coloured areas at the bottom.
