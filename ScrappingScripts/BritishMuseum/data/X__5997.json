", " According to notes on the inventory cards in Philadelphia and a published note by U. H\u00f6ckmann (2007, 21-22 with note 106), fragment A was analysed in January 2003 and confirmed to be of calcite. Findspot 'Temenos of Second Temple of Apollo' noted on Philadelphia register card and EEF distribution list. It corresponds to EEF distribution list Philadelphia no. 14. The early excavations at Naukratis provided much evidence for the mass production of vessels in calcite during the Late Period, likely in the 5th century BC and maybe already in the late 6th. Petrie noted that \u2018many thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u2019 as well as unfinished vessels in alabaster were found in the temenos of Apollo, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). The bulk of calcite vessels discovered in Naukratis are alabastra, but other shapes are present such as bowl, jug and lekythos. The drilling was performed by using a tube in copper alloy with abrasive, usually dry sand.
