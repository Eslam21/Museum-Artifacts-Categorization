{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:235", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "INLAY ?", "Material": "ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "3.8 cm", "Depth": "0.5 cm", "Name": "Cut stone perhaps used as an inlay", "Description": "Thin segment of stone cut to a roughly circular form with dissected sides, and incised with concentric circles, interrupted by a ribbon-like motif running from the third outer line across toward the centre, and then turned back across itself. The irregular shape would suit an inlay on perhaps a wooden surface such as the handle of an implement or, given its size, a small item of furniture. Inlays with such motifs would not be usual before the Roman Period."}
