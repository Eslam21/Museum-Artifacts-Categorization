XVIII, 42; Gorton 1996, 104). Though the hieroglyphic signs have often just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun-Ra. The scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites, and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A19-31, see especially A25 for this piece).
