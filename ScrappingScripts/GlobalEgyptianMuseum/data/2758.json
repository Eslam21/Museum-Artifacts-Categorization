{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "E72:83", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Width": "1.8 cm", "Name": "Scarab with the throne name of king Tuthmosis III", "Description": "Steatite scarab with crude stylised head and wing-cases, and an incised motif on the underside showing a throned king holding the crook and flagellum, to the left of a cartouche containing the throne-name of Tuthmosis III, Menkheperra. The name of that 18th Dynasty king continued to be used for at least eight hundred years after his death on scarab amulets. This example may be dated by the style of the motif to the period of Ramesside mass-production of scarabs, about two centuries after his reign."}
