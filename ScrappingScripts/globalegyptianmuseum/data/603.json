One does not only find them inside or near the tombs of the beneficiaries, but also in the sanctuaries where the offerings in favour of the gods were also reserved for the deceased. This example, which was part of the G. Hagemans collection, is in the name of the \"great Chief Official of the divine adoratrice\" Ibi, whose tomb is found in the necropolis of Assasif."}
