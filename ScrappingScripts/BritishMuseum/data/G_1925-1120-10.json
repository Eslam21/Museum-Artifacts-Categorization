{"artifact_name": "plug", "Object Type": ["plug"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.10"], "Description": [" Terracotta plug in form of head of Hephaestos. A plug in the form of a bearded head of Hephaistos, with a frowning expression, wearing a pointed cap; at the rear the hair is shown beneath the rim of the cap. The head and neck rise from a boat-shaped object with a truncated end. The end is blackened by fire, as is the lower part of the face of the god and his hair: it was no doubt inserted into something that had a fire within it, and may have been a plug for a peep-hole in a kiln, removable for inspection of the interior. Solid; apparently made in a two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface.
