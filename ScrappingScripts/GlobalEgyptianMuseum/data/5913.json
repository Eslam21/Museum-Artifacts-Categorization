{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "9999", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED; PAINTED", "Height": "42.8 cm", "Name": "Standing lady", "Description": "The woman is wearing a shoulder-length wig consisting of graceful tresses, and the white dress with shoulder straps of elite ladies covered by a broad collar. The straps of the dress and the broad collar were indicated in paint only, of which only traces remain. She is standing upright with her arms hanging down at her sides, but not pressed against her body because a bridge is left between the two. The full face seems personalized. The lady appears to have a cheerful, somewhat mischievous personality. The modelling and the size of the statue lead to the conclusion that it was made for the closed statue room (serd\u00c3\u00a2b) of one of the many mastabas in the Giza necropolis."}
