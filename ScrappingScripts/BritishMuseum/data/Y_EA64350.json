{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA64350"], "Description": [" Fragmentary quartzite-sandstone head of a male figure. He has a broad shaven head, with subtle modelling of the cranium. His ears project slightly forwards,and have been carefully rendered. His brow is deep set and his eyes are almond shaped with a heavy upper eyelid. There is a subtle suggestion of the thinner skin underneath the eyes. His nose is long and broad at the nostrils, with a slight cupid's bow visible above the upper lip. His lower lip, which is larger than his upper lip, slopes down at the centre and is sharply incised along the edge. The outer corners of his mouth are slightly upturned, suggesting a small smile. His cheekbones and jawline are particularly prominent, with a further ridge of flesh visible on either side of the lower lip. There are small chips to the stone surface particularly at the tip of the nose, chin and mouth, and the outer edges of the ears. There is a slightly larger chip behind the ear on the left side.
