The crude drawing of the second figure from the right, wearing the sun-disk, indicates a date in the Ptolemaic or early Roman Periods, as does the choice of pink for one of the vertical dividing bands. A beaded base-line of alternating red and blue rectangles between white-black-white segments appears to mark the border of the panel."}
