{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 61990A", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "CHARIOT", "Material": "WOOD; GLASS", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Name": "Chariot of Tutankhamun", "Description": "The wheel was known in ancient Egypt as early as the Old Kingdom, but the horse-drawn chariot was introduced much later by the Hyksos, who migrated into Egypt from western Asian regions around 1650 BC. The chariot was one of the main reasons for the Hyksos' domination of Egypt. This is one of six dismantled chariots discovered in the antechamber of Tutankhamun's tomb. Intended to be used in ceremonial processions, it was richly decorated with fine gilded motifs depicting the king as a Sphinx overcoming African and Asian foes. The wheels are fixed to the axles by linchpins and secured with leather thongs to provide better suspension. The Egyptian chariot was usually drawn by two horses and driven by a driver, as shown in war scenes on the walls of the temples."}
