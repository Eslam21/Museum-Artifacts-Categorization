It could belong to Gorton type XXVIII B (Gorton 1996, 103-105). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun. The nfr-sign has probably here the value 'j' by acrophony with the jb-heart sign (Drioton 1957, 13). Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
