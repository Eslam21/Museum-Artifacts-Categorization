The myth of Oedipus is one of the most famous legends in Greek mythology. Oedipus's father, King Laius, abandoned him after being alarmed by the prophecy of the Sphinx, which foretold that his son would kill him and marry his wife.Oedipus was found by a shepherd who took him to the King of Corinth, who raised him as his own son. When Oedipus grew up, he left Corinth and encountered and killed a man who he did not recognize to be his real father, King Laius. He reached Thebes and freed the region from the monstrous Sphinx after correctly guessing that the answer to the famous riddle: \"What is it that in the morning walks on four legs, at midday walks on two and in the evening on three?\" was \"man.\" Oedipus became King of Thebes and married Queen Jocasta, not knowing that she was his mother. When he discovered that he had not only killed his own father but also married his mother, he blinded himself and Jocasta hanged herself."}
