", " Of a type typical of the Nile delta in the Late Period (parallel from Memphis in Petrie 1909, pl.35, no.13), similar, but more complicated examples extend into the early Ptolemaic period (at Schedia early Ptolemaic pieces from the 4th century BC, Bergman pers. comm. and forthcoming). Three similar simple mould-made Bes plaque figures from Naukratis are currently in the Bolton Museum (1886.31.15, 1886.31.16, 1886.31.17) and two similar double Bes figure plaques from Naukratis are in the Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA581) and Bristol Museum (H2805). Unprovenanced parallels in Cairo Museum (CG27355, CG27256 = SR5/1222, JE31615A-B= CG27247-8, and SR5/1223), from Memphis (Cairo Museum JE34196= CG32871) and from Saqqara as part of a group with a phallophorous Harpocrates dated Late Period to Ptolemaic (Martin 1981, pl.23, nos 306, 307 and 1331). Possibly a fragment of a larger phallophorous figure model, a procession that usually involves a pair of Bes\u2019 and a pair of priests holding Harpocrates\u2019 phallus, who has a naked female tambourine player (wearing a diadem) on his shoulder or head.
