{"Present location": "ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM [06/002] AMSTERDAM", "Inventory number": "APM 9249", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP IV/AMENOPHIS IV/NEFERKHEPERURE/AKHENATEN", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "LOW RELIEF", "Height": "15.5 cm", "Width": "14.7 cm", "Depth": "2.2 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a relief with a royal figure", "Description": "The sandstone fragment has been roughly cut out and is therefore irregular in shape. It shows a standing figure in low relief facing right and lifting up two offering bowls (only one is still present) to the sun disk. Two of the disk's rays, ending in hands, are visible. The figure is wearing a khepresh crown, which has not  been preserved. It is unclear whether the line at the neck indicates the presence of a necklace or the neck of a robe. The style of the representation, especially the shape of the chin, suggests that the piece stems from the Amarna Period. The sun rays ending in hands confirm this suggestion. The person depicted may be Nefertiti, as the blue crown is only worn by royal persons, and the hollow curve of the neck indicates that the figure is female."}
