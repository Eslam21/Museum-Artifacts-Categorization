The fragment can be compared with the gold belt in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, from Lambousa, Cyprus (for bibliography see Kent & Painter 1971, no.191). The coins correspond (reading left to right with obverse portraits uppermost) to those in Bellinger & Grierson 1966 (1, pp.70-1, nos 9h, 9e, 9i, 8j, 9h, and 9c).
