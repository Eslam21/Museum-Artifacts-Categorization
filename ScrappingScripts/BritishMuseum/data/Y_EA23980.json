"], "Museum number": ["EA23980"], "Description": [" Two fragments, not joined, from a corroded iron object or possibly two different items. The smaller is made of a curved sheet of metal in the shape of a kind of carving gouge, larger on the side of the edge and narrower on the other end (the tang ?), which is broken. The larger one is made of a flat piece of metal, rounded at its narrower end and broken at the other, larger end surrounded by an oval ferrule made of a large stripe of metal. The two parts are stuck together by corrosion mixed with what might be organic material (wood?). This item might be interpreted as the central part of a tool or knife with a handle fixed by a ferrule.
