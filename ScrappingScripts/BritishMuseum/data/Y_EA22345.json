{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA22345"], "Description": [" An intact pottery amphora with a small flared foot, convex sides widening to the shoulder, two handles and a cylindrical neck, finished with an external rim. The exterior was covered by a pale slip, which varies from cream to pink in colour in different areas, but much of this slip has disappeared owing to exfoliation of the surface. The core fabric is compact and dull brown in colour; it contains sand and small flecks of limestone. In applying the handles to the neck too much pressure was exerted, with the result that the neck was deformed to an eliptical shape instead of a circle.
