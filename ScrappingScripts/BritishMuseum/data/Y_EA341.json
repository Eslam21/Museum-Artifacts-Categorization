{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA341"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Pashad: the god Amen-Re\u2018 is enthroned on the right of this round-topped stela. The necropolis-workman Pashed stands on the left in adoration. Below the figures are two lines of text naming the necropolis-workman. The figures are in sunk relief and all texts are incised. The stela is battered about the edges, and there are several gouges on the surface. The area around the god's head appears to have been damaged and then repaired in antiquity. There are no traces of colour, but there are remains of plaster in some of the hieroglyphs.

The name of the workman in the last line appears to be garbled. It is possible that the 'nb' sign was not completely carved as the area between the two strokes is left blank rather than damaged later. If the name can be read as Pennub, another stela (Fitzwilliam Museum EGA 3002.1943) names a workman Pashed and his son Pennub (J. Janssen, \u2018Chronique d\u2019\u00c9gypte\u2019 25 (Brussels, 1950), 207-12). This Pashed should be identified with the workman Pashed, son of Pennub, who flourished under Amenmesse (J. Janssen, 'Commodity Prices from the Ramesside Period' (Leiden, 1975), 77). His father, Pennub the Elder, is known from an ostracon of year 40 of Ramses II, while another Pennub who appears at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty is probably to be identified as Pennub, the younger son of Pashed (Janssen, op. cit., 77).
