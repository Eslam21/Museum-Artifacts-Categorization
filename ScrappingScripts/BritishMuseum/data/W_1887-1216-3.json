{"artifact_name": "basin", "Object Type": ["basin"], "Museum number": ["1887,1216.3"], "Description": [" Brass bowl with straight sides inclining inwards with a flat base. The bowl was raised in one piece and the rim thickened to form a flat surface on top. There is a deep lathe centring mark on the inside and a shallow mark on the bottom. The decoration is neatly engraved on a cross hatch background and there is no evidence for any inlay. The side of the bowl is divided into fourteen equal-sized zones, measuring 4cm along the base. Each section contains one mammal with a bird above it and each animal has its Arabic name engraved on its body. Each section is separated by plants, some pomegranate trees. A wavy line runs above and below the main panel of decoration and there is a z-border around the side of the rim. The top of the rim is flat and is engraved with an inscription which runs all around it. Inside there is a sunburst design similar to those on several Veneto-Saracenic round-bottomed bowls. Graffiti of the name \u2018ali is written in Arabic on the interior and on the base. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Mamluk dynasty (?) ", " Ottoman dynasty (?)
