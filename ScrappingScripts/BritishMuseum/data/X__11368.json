However Bernand cites measurements which he seems to have acquired from notes by Ricci; he also notes two cuttings on the top and two large cuttings underneath; from this the inference is drawn that it is the base for a statuette. The pieces is discussed and further literature is given in William Horbury and David Noy, Jewish Inscriptions of Graeco-Roman Egypt (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 42-44, no. 26."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (68, 15 and pl.
