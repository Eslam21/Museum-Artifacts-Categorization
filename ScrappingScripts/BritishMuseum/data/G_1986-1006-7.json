{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1006.7"], "Description": [" Head of clay figure of Harpokrates. A head broken from a large figure of Harpokrates. His hair falls in curls around his face and is tied in a topknot from which curling strands of hair descend on his brow. He does not have a finger to his mouth, and a large wreath of leaves, blooms and fruit is worn, with a lotus bud angled up on each side of the topknot; above the latter is a Double Crown, the upper part of which is lost. What little remains of the back is flat and plain. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown clay with a red and grey core.
