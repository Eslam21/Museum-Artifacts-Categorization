The skull is pierced at the apex of the skull with a keyhole slot, possibly for the attachment of a crest. At either side of the skull is the pivoted terminal of the detachable visor. The main edges are bordered by close set lining holes, and round the base of the skull is a row of lining rivet holes. The front plate has a row of flush lining rivets at its lower edge. At the lower rear is a group of three rivets above a large hole, for a lost hinged hasp for securing the helmet to the backplate. The surface is patinated. The front plate is damaged at the edges, and somewhat dented. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Late Medieval"], "Production date": ["1430 (circa)"], "Production place": [" Made in: Italy (?)
