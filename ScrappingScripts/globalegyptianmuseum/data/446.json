{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2844", "Dating": "2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (not before); NEW KINGDOM (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; ENGRAVED", "Height": "10.9 cm", "Name": "Fertility figurine", "Description": "This piece in terracotta is a variant of the \"fertility figurines\" (see E.2527), which generally represent a female standing. Here, the woman is spread out on a bed, the head placed on a pillow. She is also distinguished by the specific gesture of the hands which seem support the breasts and by an enormous dotted pubis. On the left leg, one notices the two arms of a child whose head is broken. This ex-voto dates, as the other similar examples, from the end of the 18th Dynasty or from the beginning of the Ramesside Period."}
