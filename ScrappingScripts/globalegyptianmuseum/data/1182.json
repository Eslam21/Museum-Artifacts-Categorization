{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7047D", "Dating": "21ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI ?", "Category": "BANDAGE", "Material": "FLAX", "Technique": "WOVEN; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Width": "13.9 cm", "Name": "Mummy bandage", "Description": "This bandage, which was purchased in the art trade of Brussels in 1935, originally was part of a piece of linen which served as clothing for a divine statue; the fragmentary inscription that the bandage bears is quite clear: \"[Clothes made by the ... (title)] ...-en-Khonsu (second part of a proper name), to his master Osiris, the prince, the great, to beseech for  life, integrity, and health, a long lasting life...\". The dedicant has therefore offered this piece of linen to dress an image of Osiris. It was then used as a mummy bandage, charged with the magical protection coming from the statue of Osiris that it had touched. The bandage, which is in a good state of preservation, probably dates from the 21st Dynasty."}
