Some were then re-attributed to the Parthian or Sasanian period, in the former case because of the existence of bone dolls at that period. In no case are the attributions correct. This particular object was previously said to be Sasanian and exhibited as such in the 1975 Iranian gallery but this attribution is also incorrect. Several similar objects of this type exist in other collections: 'Tresors de l'Ancien Iran', Mus\u00e9e Rath, Geneva (1966), cat. 689; 'Altpersische Kunst' (Galerie Beyeler, Basle, Austellung July - August 1962) no.50; 'Christie's Fine Antiquities' (London) 25/11/97, p.50, lot 187 = attributed a date of ca 4000 BC; E.
