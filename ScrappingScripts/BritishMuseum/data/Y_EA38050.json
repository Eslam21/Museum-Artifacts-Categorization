{"artifact_name": "dish-cover", "Object Type": ["dish-cover"], "Museum number": ["EA38050"], "Description": [" An ivory cover for a dish: with the upper surface carved in a representation of a trussed ox. The piece has been skilfully carved, with the details of the mouth, eyes and legs depicted, but the ivory has decayed and cracked with age. Repaired from several fragments with some parts missing. On the underside the ivory has been hollowed into two depressions, one rectangular and the other semicircular, perhaps in order to fit closely over the dish and its contents.

Dreyer, 'Mitteilungen der Deutschen Arch\u00e4ologischen Instituts Abteilung Kairo' 32 (Wiesbaden, 1976), 83-7 and pls.22-6). No Early Dynastic parallels to this form of ivory dish have been found, the style being more similar to ivory and wooden carving of the New Kingdom, see J. Vandier d'Abbadie, 'Les objets de toilette \u00e9gyptiens' (1972), nos. 65-8; 73-5; 118. Petrie considered this object itself to be a dish, rather than a lid, but this would have meant the decorated side being always underneath and invisible. Bibliography: W. M. F.
