{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA857"], "Description": [" Red granite lion statue: the prenomen and nomen of Ramses II with the epithet 'beloved like Horus' are incised on the back of this recumbent lion. An incised inscription, originally written twice around the base, gives the Horus name, 'nebty' name, prenomen and nomen of Ramses II with the same epithet. This statue has suffered badly from damp and erosion. The entire front of the lion has been worn away leaving only the back in a good state of preservation. The lower left side of the base on the back has been slightly chipped with loss to the inscription probably during transport from Athribis.
