", " Hayes compares this sherd with others from Tocra and identifies them as similar to Tocra Type II Chian chalices. The lotus flower and bud motif is found on Wild Goat Style chalices and the lack of interior decoration also suggests that the sherd may be earlier in the Wild Goat Style, rather than in the later Mature Animal style. For parallels regarding the lotus motif, see Lemos 1991, pl. 11-2, no. 114 from Emporio; pl. 13, no. 124 from Rizari.
