C5 and 6, p. 286. Jesuits arrived in Macau in 1565 and made it their East Asian base; remained Portuguese despite Dutch attempts to attack it until 1999 when it was formally handed to China. If not made in Macau, it could be Sri Lankan, though the characteristics noted here don't match well. Jeremy Warren comments that it might also be Netherlandish, thgough the stylised trees look close to another ivory of the same subject said to be Chinese, 17th Century.
