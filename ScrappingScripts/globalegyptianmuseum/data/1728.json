The snake head appears as a funerary amulet to protect the deceased from serpent bites, a serious danger still in Egypt. In Egyptian art the snake is also used to represent the power protecting the sun-god against enemies, in the form of the 'uraeus' or rising cobra. Snake head amulets featured in the regular sets of emblems protecting the deceased in Late Period mummification; previously they are attested in carnelian, in the burials of kings and high officials of the New Kingdom and later, and in depictions of objects of power in early Middle Kingdom coffins."}
