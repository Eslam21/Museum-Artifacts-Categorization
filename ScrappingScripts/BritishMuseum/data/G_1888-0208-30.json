CVA British Museum 8 Not from the same pot as Pl. GB 604, 13 (as Petrie and BMC have it). After the middle of the sixth century the East Greek Gorgon regularly has a loose halo of curling snakes. Examples from vase-painting are the Gorgoneia of a Fikellura cup in Samos (AM lix, Beilage 11. 1), of a Clazomenian sherd in Brussels (M.381: CVA iii, pl. 106. 5), and of a Clazomenian sarcophagus of markedly East Greek black figure style (see text to Pl. GB 614, 1). There are also many Gorgoneia of this type on East Greek coins (some references given by A. Furtw\u00e4ngler in W. H. Roscher's Ausf\u00fchrliches Lexikon der gr. und r\u00f6m.
