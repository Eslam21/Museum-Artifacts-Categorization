{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "18240", "Dating": "20TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "ROCK; SANDSTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "51 cm", "Name": "Upper part of a royal statue", "Description": "The statue represents a king wearing a head-cloth, royal beard and uraeus. Unfortunately the surface is weathered, the facial features are smoothed and only the very beginning of the titulary is preserved on the back pillar, which makes attribution problematic. However, both stylistic features and the material, reddish sandstone, are characteristic of the Ramesside period."}
