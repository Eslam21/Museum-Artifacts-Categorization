It is painted gesso and well decorated but crudely fashioned.The Ba was the part of a person associated with the concept of 'personality', being the attributes that made any one individual unique. It is often portrayed in funerary reliefs as a bird with a human head and sometimes arms. It was necessary for the dead person to journey from the tomb to rejoin his Ka and become an Akh or spirit in the Afterlife, but as this was a physical impossibility it became the duty of the Ba. In order that the physical body of the deceased should survive in the Afterlife, it needed to be reunited with the Ba every night. "}
