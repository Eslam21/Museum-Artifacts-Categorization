The upper part broken at waist. She stands looking slightly towards her right, holding a jug on her head with her upraised right arm. The weight is cushioned by a pad. There may be the letter delta incuse on the jug. Her hair has a central parting and the locks are brushed to each side; there are indications that a sakkos was worn. She is dressed in a short-sleeved chiton with a deep V neckline, girdled just below her breasts. The back is plain. Hollow, from two-piece mould, then painted with traces of pink paint on jug and cloth by left breast. Orange-brown Nile silt with abundance fine gold mica and sparse dung and white inclusions <1mm. Discolouration and surface damage caused by subsequent burning.

Naukratis examples at Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA346, NA511), Bolton Museum (1886.31.13) and the British Museum dated to the 3rd century BC (GR 1886,0401.1436, Bailey 2008, no. 3168, is from same mould as Bolton 1886.31.13). Good parallels from Athribis (Tell Atrib) are dated to the 3rd century BC (Szma\u0144ska 2005, nos 196, 199). Classical to early Hellenistic Egyptian parallels (Fischer 1994, pl.10, no. 62), probably copying late 5th century BC examples from Attica (Higgins 1954, no. 697) and late 4th century BC parallels from Knidos (Burn & Higgins 2001, no2523). The Closest parallels in style date from the 3rd and 2nd century BC. However similar examples have been found dating up to the Roman period: from the Hadra cemetery, Alexandria; (Adriani 1940, pl. 39, no. 5); thought to be from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. E4745); dated to the Roman Imperial Period (Fjeldhagen 1995, no. 140); the jar inscribed to Hera and Zeus, purchased at Memphis (Graindor 1939, pl. 22, no. 56; Petrie et al. 1910, pl. 44, no. 163, Petrie Museum UC48496); from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC48198); dated beginning of first century AD (Pingiatoglou 1993, no. 121). A number of unprovenanced hydrophoroi are known (Sotheby\u2019s Sale Catalogue, 8\u20139 December 1986, lot 120; Breccia 1934, nos 220 and 221).
