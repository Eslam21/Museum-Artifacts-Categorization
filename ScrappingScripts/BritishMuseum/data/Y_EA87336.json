{"artifact_name": "ear-ring; bead", "Object Type": [" ear-ring ", " bead "], "Museum number": ["EA87336"], "Description": [" Three ear-rings, four beads made in different shapes and materials. A: Two fragments of penannular ear-rings, one made of jasper, the other of carnelian. Both are triangular in section, have notches at the outer edge and a circumferential incised line running parallel to the edge. Each has one original end preserved, the other broken off. The outer surface is well smoothed, the inner shows traces from the drill. The carnelian one is slightly smaller. B: One fragment of a penannular ear-ring made of jasper. Rounded triangular in section, the outer surface is well smoothed, both ends broken off. The inner surface shows traces from the drill. C: One cylindrical shaped bead with a facetted surface made of what looks like a blue stone (lapis lazuli?) but has a distinctly lighter blue core around the perforation, therefore might have been produced artificially, blue glass? D: One elongated spherical bead made of glass, now pearlescent in colour. E: Two disc-shaped beads, one slightly larger and made of light turquoise faience, the smaller one made of white faience.
