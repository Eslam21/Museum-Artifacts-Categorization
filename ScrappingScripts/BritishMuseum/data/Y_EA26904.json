Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (various moulds published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 1-19; on productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Lion-shaped scaraboids belong to a quite standard production at Naukratis. For a similar type of mould: BM 1896,0610.16 (though not same master). Numerous couchant lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis (see for example the ones illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos. 50, 654, 69, 80, 92, 99, 104). Gorton, A. F. 1996, Egyptian and Egyptianizing scarabs: a typology of steatite, faience and paste scarabs from Punic and other Mediterranean sites, Oxford.
