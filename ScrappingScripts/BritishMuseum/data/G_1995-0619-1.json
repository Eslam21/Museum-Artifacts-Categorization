A bust of a goddess, probably Demeter, wearing a chiton, and veiled, her himation passing over a high plain diadem, crossing her breasts and continuing over her left shoulder. Her head is turned slightly to her left; her hair has a centre parting and is brushed to each side. The bust rests on a curved plainfaced plinth, which has two wick-holes with wick-rests below, to enable its owner to use the object as a lamp, probably in a household shrine. The back is plain, except for a triangular filling-hole cut through it, and a pierced suspension-lug applied behind the diadem. Hollow; two-piece mould, with floor of oilchamber added. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with the remains of a white dressing on the front, but not on the plinth, the face of which is painted green. Slight pre-firing damage to the right cheek.
