{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1972,0125.9"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of dwarf with basket of food. A somewhat grotesque male celebrant, rather dwarfish, corpulent and bandy-legged: a hole for his gigantic lost inserted phallus forces his knees apart; his navel protrudes and he has receding hair. He is largely naked, with a himation rolled up and encircling his waist, the two ends hanging down on each of his thighs. A garland hangs round his neck and rests on his chest, and he wears a conical hat with a knob at the top, tied with ribbon round the brim, the knot on the front. His left hand supports a basket on his shoulder, the basket holding two round fruits and three bunches of grapes, with vine-leaves between them. His lowered right hand holds a small furry animal by its rear legs; it has a short tail, and may be a dog or pig. There is minimal detail at the rear and a suspension-lug is placed behind the neck (the feet are flat below and there is no plinth). Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange to red-brown Nile silt; traces overall of a white dressing.
