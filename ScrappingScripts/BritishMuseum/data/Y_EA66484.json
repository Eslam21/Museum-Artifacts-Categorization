The owl sign is often associated on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids with solar symbols (see example of an owl between an obelisk and sun-disk in Gorton 1996, 103, no. 84) or other sacred signs (Maat feather, ankh sign: Gardner 1888, pl. 18, no. 42; Gorton 1996, 104). Though the hieroglyphic signs have often just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (various trigrams of Amun analysed in Drioton 1957). The scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A19-31, see especially A26 for this piece). Variant of the same motif on scarabs and scaraboids from the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming): Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 99-104; Gardner 1888, pl. 18, 42.
