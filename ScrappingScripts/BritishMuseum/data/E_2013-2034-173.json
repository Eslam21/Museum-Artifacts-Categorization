{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.173"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of engraved rock art on a boulder, showing the pecked, infilled figures of a human, six dogs, two caprine and an unidentified quadruped animal, all upright. The human figure stands face-on at the top left of the boulder with a large unidentified animal to its right. The unidentified animal is bulky and faces right, its head/horn is eroded. Below the human figure is an caprine with short horns (Barbary sheep?) facing right with long, curved, upward growing horns. The caprine is surrounded by five dogs, apparently attacking it (hunting?). Below is a sketchier form of another animal (possibly a caprine or hippotragini/grazing antelope) in a different style, facing left with a dog pursuing it from the right, with outstretched limbs as if running. To the right of these are several unidentified shapes in the rock which resemble the fore or back legs of a running dog. The human figure has a deep, engraved emanation rising from the top of its head, long and thin with a leaf-shaped terminal, and another to the right, shorter and wider (headdress?) and may be holding something in the left hand. Random, interspersed pecking marks cover the entire tableau. A 5cm photo scale has been fitted at the base of the image. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.

Wadi Hamra is a canyon-like valley with a relatively flat floor between one and 200m wide, curling more or less south into the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert. There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " animal ", " mammal ", " headgear/hairstyle ", " hunting/shooting ", " dog ", " antelope (?)
