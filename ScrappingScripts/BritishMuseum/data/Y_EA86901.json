{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86901"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a slightly convex surface, maybe from a leather bag. One impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.1cm is impressed in the break. The upper side is roughly flat and upwards to the preserved side. The half of a somewhat larger impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. A standing finger is preserved in the middle, wearing the double feather crown and a beard, one arm raised behind his head, the other hanging down in front of the body from where a bent sign like a uraeus(?) continues. The very small hieroglyphs left of his head are a wsr and above a seated mAa.t with a sun disc above the head, underneath the wsr a small t-sign. The rest of the seal is broken off. The same motif but less clear is visible on EA86817.
