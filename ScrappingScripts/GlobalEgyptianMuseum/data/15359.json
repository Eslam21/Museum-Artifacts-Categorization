{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "SR 10484", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "96 cm", "Name": "Statue Possibly Representing Mark Anthony", "Description": "Because of the lack of distinctive facial features that would enable us to identify its owner precisely, the statue may represent Caesarion more than Mark Anthony. The statue is in a standing position, has a strong torso and stands with his left leg forward.He is wearing a kilt and the Nemes royal headdress, beneath which traces of evenly curled hair are visible. The combination of Egyptian stylistic details including the pose and clothing, with Greco-Roman details like the curled hair, shows this statue to be an example of the Hellenistic-Egyptian school of art."}
