{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86713"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with one row of basketry coil impression at the rear, another one at the side, meaning that this sealing was positioned at the top of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles and was hardened after excavation. The top part shows finger impressions around one deep impression of a scarab-like seal. The seal consists of a small horizontal cartouche that is broken off, underneath two figures, the one on the left kneeling with both arms raised up, in front of an offering stand or a standard, the figure on the right seated on a throne, seems to be the same seal as on EA86691, EA86693 and EA86705. It is quite possible that the sign between the figures is actually a sceptre from the figure on the throne.
