", " This figure was discovered in a large cache of bronzes in Teh el-Barud, a settlement located closeby Naukratis (Gardner 1888, 81, pl. XV no. 14; Weiss 2012, 445-446; Masson forthcoming). Iah is a minor moon god who became part of Osiris (Griffiths 1976, 156). This figure belongs to the type 73 in Weiss typology of Egyptian bronzes from the Delta (Weiss 2012, 162, 619-621, Pl. 20a-c, Typ 73, see esp. Nr. 375 for this piece). Bronzes of Osiris-Iah are mainly attested in the Memphite region, particularly in the Serapeion of Saqqara and according to the few that can be dated, they seem to be Late Period in date (Weiss 2012, 162-164, 619-622).
