{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "ACO.Tx.0268", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "AKHMIM", "Category": "COPTIC TEXTILE", "Material": "FLAX; WOOL", "Technique": "WOVEN", "Height": "32.5 cm", "Name": "Medallion", "Description": "This piece of fabric is decorated with an embroidered medallion of ecru-coloured linen and purple wool and depicts a paradIsiacal scene. Two \"eroses\" flapping in the sky and two deer prancing around on the earth flank a kantharos  with green leaves coming out of it. Although these decorative elements are completely derived from the ancient world they still bear witness to Christian symbolism: the kantharos (chalice) and the vines refer to the Eucharist; the deer are references to the psalm of baptism where water is the source of life."}
