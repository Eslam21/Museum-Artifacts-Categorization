{"artifact_name": "votive figure", "Object Type": ["votive figure"], "Museum number": ["EA27333"], "Description": [" Hollow terracotta figure of Harpocratis in a long feminine tunic, standing on a convex-faced plinth with horizontal mouldings, and leaning on a pier with mouldings at top and bottom. Her finger is to her mouth, she holds a cornucopia against her left shoulder, and rests her arm against a falcon standing on top of the altar. She has a full head of hair with a wreath defining her face, and wears a small Double Crown, largely lost; she may have crescent earrings, but they might be the lowest elements of the wreath. On the face of the pier, certainly inscribed in modern times, is a group of hieroglyphs. Back un-modelled; circular vent, broken at one side; irregular hole broken through below it. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with brown surface. Traces of a white dressing.

Gy\u00f6ry (2002: 77) states that the group of hieroglyphs inscribed on the face of the pier were cut before firing, but this is not so. The text must have been copied from a printed edition of the Middle Kingdom Instructions of Khety, concerning the advantages of being a scribe, and is discussed by H.W. Fischer-Elfert in Gy\u00f6ry 2002: 94\u20135, who was needlessly concerned about the possibility of a version of these Instructions being available in Ptolemaic times.
