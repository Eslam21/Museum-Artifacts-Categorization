{"artifact_name": "hinge", "Object Type": ["hinge"], "Museum number": ["EA23863"], "Description": [" Corroded copper alloy door or chest butt-hinge made of two thin metal leaves articulated by three barrels, now blocked by corrosion : the leaf with the central barrel is broken across a round fixing hole near the articulation ; the other, with the lateral barrels, is made of a long strip ending with a large disc folded at the other end around the axis of the hinge. Two round holes have been punched for fixing to the door, one in the center of the distal disc, the other near the knuckle, with its counterpart visible on the broken end of the folded part beneath. The visible side of the fitting is decorated with incised or rather hallmarked circles, two concentric ones around the hole in the middle of the disc, two others, on the central strip near the disc, side by side, and another one or possibly a pair, near the hinge; the last three (or four) surround an internal thin and tight spiral groove. The hole near the knuckle has not been perforated in the center of the last circle, but partly on its perimeter.
