A row of 'ankh'- and 'was'-signs runs from the uraeus on the god's sun-disk to the nose of the lady. An altar heaped with offerings lies between the two figures. Above the altar and the lady are six columns of principal text plus three additional columns consisting of the usual funerary invocation. At the top of the stela is a winged sun-disk below a curved sky-sign. The colour has faded and the stela has suffered slight damage from flaking since its discovery. The sky at the top is blue. The side borders are brown with horizontal black stripes, while the bottom is red with green plants, now faded. The disk at the top is red with a white outer ring and brown uraei with blue heads. Its upper wings are white with brown dots; there is a thick blue stripe in the centre; and the lower wings are green with black lines and edged in red. The background of the stela is white. The hieroglyphs are black on a brown background between grey columns. The disk of the god is red with a white outer ring and a brown uraeus. His body is blue with a brown and blue upper face and a white lower face and black upper beak. The upper part of his costume is green now faded, and his kilt is brown and white. His necklace and bangles are brown. His sceptre is green and his ankh-sign is blue. The signs to the lady are black with brown centres. The altar is blue with green floral offerings, red and green lotuses, and red duck on a white dish on a black stand. The female figure has a pink body, darkened to red under the dress, a black wig with red fillet, red and white cone, and green wreath. The eye is black surrounded by white. The necklace is green, while the dress is white with pink stripes.
