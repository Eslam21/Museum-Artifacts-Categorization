This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Probably from a sphinx or a musician figure. Sphinx figures were relatively common at Naukratis (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1519, GR 1886,0401.1518 and possibly GR 2011,5011.7; Boston MFA 86.394, Oxford, Ashmolean Museum A N1896-1908-G.72, AN1886.459, AN1886.458; Brussels Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1852; Heidelberg Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t ST55). Petrie dated these, with other limestone figures, between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886, 40, pl.19.1&3), though one was found in a Ptolemaic level (ibid.). Hogarth found one in a \u20185th century BC\u2019 well deposit (Hogarth 1905, 122; Hogarth Diary 24-25/04/ 1903, well 2 bottom). These are identical style to the \u2018concubine\u2019 and drummer figures of the Saite period, also found in the mid 6th century BC levels of the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, 40, Level 335). Unprovenanced Late Period parallel (Petrie Museum UC59370). Some of the highly varied deviations from this form, such as lying sphinxes, may be later in date (British Museum 1886,0401.1396 and 1886,0401.1485), as they have Late Period or Ptolemaic parallels from Memphis (Anthes 1959; 1965, see also in terracotta Ashton 2003a, 77, Petrie Museum, UC 48012-6; Nicholson & Thomas 2013, 73, P-390) and Saqq\u00e2ra (Quibbel 1907, pl.30.6a-c; see also in terracotta Jeffreys et. al. 1988, fig. 64, nos.77/308 and 77/u 209) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC60105, see also in terracotta T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 126; 98-9, pl.65, no. 129). Alternatively this may be a fragment of a female musician, of a form usually naked, other than a wig, playing a drum/ tambour or a lyre/harp were relatively common at Naukratis. These were crudely carved from soft limestone, with traces of red and black paint, though variations exist in the style and the instrument depicted. The earliest variants, flat drum or tambour player figures, were the most common at Naukratis (Hogarth 1899, pl.14.6; Hogarth et al. 1905, 130, pl.14.6; Petrie 1886, 40; British Museum 1965,0930.930; Oxford AN1886.543; Boston 86.162), with rare slightly finer variant (Boston 86.163). A number of drummers were found at the Naukratis Scarab Factory, in a stratum dated by Petrie to 580BC (Petrie 1886, 40, Level 335). Musicians playing harps follow the same style, but are less common at Naukratis (Oxford AN1896-1908-G.71, and possibly Cambridge GR.3.1887). Presumably later, more three dimensional, lyre players were also rare (Oxford AN1922.212). Close Late Period parallels were found at Kom Firin (Petrie Museum UC16473; N.Spencer 2013, F343) and late 6th or early 5th century BC Sais (Daressy 1901, 230-239; Cairo JE 90239, exc. no.78; JE 90240, exc. no.79; JE 90241, exc. no. 80; JE90251, exc. no. 149) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC4530; UC4530 with flute; see also UC8575 \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019; UC33273, Petrie 1927, 58 pl.50.312). These musical instruments were used during inundation and other religious festivals of Egypt (Pinch 1993; Manniche 1991; Barrett 2011). Most are Saite in date, but three-dimensional and more life-like variants continue into the Persian Period. Late 7th to 6th century BC, with later variants continue into the 5th century BC.
