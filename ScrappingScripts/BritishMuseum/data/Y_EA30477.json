{"artifact_name": "pendant; amulet", "Object Type": [" pendant ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA30477"], "Description": [" Cylindrical pendant amulet: made from three cylindrical amethyst beads threaded on a copper alloy pin with a gold foil cap at the top and remains of a lower cap (now restored). The latter had lost its lid and is frayed around the edges. The upper cap is made from a conical piece of very thin sheet gold with a flat disc for a lid. A ring, scored with four lines, is soldered to the top. It has been worn away on both sides by the wire or thread on which it was suspended. The amethyst beads are separated by bands of gold foil which seem to be wrapped around the edges of the amethyst beads and not over a core. The middle bead has slipped out of the foil covering.
