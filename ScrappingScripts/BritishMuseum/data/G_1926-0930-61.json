{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.50"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of priest carrying a cult image. A priest standing, his head shaven except for a side-lock, wearing a fringed shawl over a long tunic. He carries an image of Osiris-in-a-Jar against his left chest and shoulder, holding it with his hands hidden in the fabric of his shawl; the weight of the jar is taken by straps over the shoulders. The 'Canopic' figure of Osiris-Hydreios has a wreath round its base and wears the nemes headdress; its head is surmounted by the atef crown. The lower part of the priest is broken away and the back is plain. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous pale-brown clay, perhaps a mix of marl and Nile silt, covered overall with an orange-brown slip.

Near: Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1982.1111; Ballet 1998: 228, fig. 13, found at Ibrahimieh, Alexandria = Breccia 1930: no. 280 = LIMC vii (2): pl. 91, Osiris Kanopos 86; Fischer 1994: no. 383, dated late Hellenistic or later = Vogt 1924: pl. 3 (no. 382 is less like ours). For a head broken from a figure, with the jar, from Alexandria, see Gallo 2002: 24, fig. 5. Compare also a grey-granite statue, probably of late first- or second-century ad date, found in the harbour of Alexandria: Goddio et al. 1998: 41, 179, 189\u201394 and 251; Gallo 2002: 21\u20134, and two statues from Benevento: Wild 1981: pl. xxv, Arslan 1997: 507\u20138, and Dunand 2000a: 118. A Roman-period plaster statuette from Tuna el-Gebel, a necropolis of Hermopolis Magna, is in the same pose but carries a jar different from Osiris-Hydreios: Grimm 1975: pl. 76d. A bronze statuette said to be from Hermonthis (Perdrizet 1911: pl. xxii:82, Fouquet 1922: pl. ix: lot 148, Walker and Higgs 2001: 115, no. 140, dated late first century bc or first century ad) is similar to our terracotta, as is Hill 1949: pl. 5:137, another bronze figure also said to be from Hermonthis.
