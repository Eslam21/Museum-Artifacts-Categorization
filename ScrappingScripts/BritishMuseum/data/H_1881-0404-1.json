Its tip is broken away. The decoration on the handle consists of the God the Father and Son in relief, enthroned over a prostrate human figure; above them is the damaged symbol of the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. The matrix on this side is engraved with the half-length figure of a bearded man facing left in a circular frame, a sword held upright in his right hand, his cloak clasped at the shoulder. Round this, within an incised frame, is a retrograde inscription. The matrix on the reverse bears the figure of a woman seated on a cushion, facing left, her right hand raised and her left holding a book. Around this, within a circular frame, runs another retrograde inscription. Additionally with wax seal-impression.

In \u2018Prisca Munimenta\u2019 ed. F. Ranger, London, 52-3) and Keynes (1980, 138-40) argue that secular seals were used loose to accompany documents as a form of identification and authentication, while Heslop (Heslop, T.A. 1980, English Seals from the mid-ninth century to 1100, \u2018Journal of the British Archaeological Association\u2019 133, 1, 14) advocates the view that they were used to seal the letters. All three seal-dies included here (this example, reg. no. 1832,0512.2 and one from a private collection (cat. 113)) appear to have been made for secular people, with the exception of the secondary matrix of Godgy\u00f0a the nun. They were evidently owned by people of rank and standing, as the title minister or thegn on Godwin's seal-die emphasises. The sword which is brandished on all three dies is clearly also a mark of secular status. The close relationship of the male dies to coin design may indicate that they were modelled on royal seals which closely copied the current coinage. The Godwin seal-die compares closely with the 'arm and sceptre' coinage of Harthacnut, dated to 1040-2 (Dept. of Coins and Medals reg. no. 1954,0506.9 (cat. 222)). Despite the suggestion (Cramp, R. 1975, Anglo-Saxon Sculpture of the Reform Period, \u2018Tenth Century Studies\u2019, ed. D. Parsons, London and Chichester, 107, 245-7; Okasha 1971, no. 117) that the Godgy\u00f0a die should predate the Godwin die, its inferior quality and placing on what is clearly, by analogy with surviving impressions, the back of the seal, make it clear that it is a secondary adaptation of the seal-die. The decoration on the handle of the die represents the opening words of Psalm 109, \u201cThe Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool\u201d, a scene which is depicted in the Utrecht Psalter, f. 64V, an early ninth-century Carolingian manuscript which was copied in England by c. 1000 and had great influence on the development of Anglo-Saxon art. The seal-die handle is thus also likely to date to after 1000, and would conform quite well to the date of c. 1040 proposed for the Godwin matrix. If the secondary Godgy\u00f0a die represents his widow or daughter, as seems plausible, it may well date to the 1050s or even later.

", " Text from 'Catalogue of British Seal-Dies in the British Museum', A.B. Tonnochy, London 1952, cat. no. 2. Found with a whetstone and an ivory comb at Wallingford, Berks. 'Proc. Soc. Antiq.' viii, p. 468; Dalton, 'Catalogue of Ivory Carvings', no. 31 ; M. H. Longhurst, 'English Ivories', p. 10 and no. XI, London, 1926; Goldschmidt, 'Elfenbeinskulpturen', iv, no. 59; 'V.C.H. Berkshire', i, p. 244. The engraved figures are of considerably less artistic merit than those carved in relief on the handle, and the seal of Godgytha, which has the appearance of being a rather later addition, is inferior to that of Godwin. The identity of those two personages is a matter of conjecture. It seems historically improbable that Godwin the official of Cnut and Edward the Confessor is intended, and an earlier Godwin 'minister', a witness to charters of Eadgar in 967 and 972 or a person of that name, perhaps the same man, who witnessed charters of \u00c6thelred between 980 and 1016, seems more likely. The addition of Godgytha's seal suggests that Godwin may have been the founder or benefactor of a religious house, and that Godgytha his widow or near relative may have used the seal, adding her own effigy and name. There is known to have been a Saxon monastery at Cholsey, near Wallingford, said to have been founded by \u00c6thelred, and destroyed by the Danes in 1006. It is thought that B on the legend may stand for BEATI, possibly a reference to Godwin's good works. For the iconography of the reliefs on the handle see Dalton and Longhurst as above. It is probable that the missing piece of the handle showed the Dove, the whole subject being the Trinity trampling on sin, an illustration of Ps. cx. 1. Ivory seal-dies appear in antiquity, and Greek examples of the seventh century B.C. have been found (see Dalton, as above); in ancient Egypt scarab-seals appear in ivory, though rarely. The present example is the earliest belonging to the Christian era in the collection, and is the only example of real artistic value. A thirteenth-century ivory die of the Archdeaconry of Merioneth is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and is illustrated in the 'Catalogue of the Exhibition of Carvings in Ivory', Burlington Fine Arts Club, no. 89, London ,1923.
