Lemos states that the sphinx is standing to left, but the curvature of the wing indicates that it is facing the opposite direction. Furthermore, the angle of the underbelly suggests that the sphinx is seated rather than standing. Sphinxes depicted on Simple Animal Style vases are usually facing left. Those facing right are probably part of an antithetical composition of confronting sphinxes. If this sherd is part of an antithetical composition, then the vessel should belong in the Group of Antithetical Sphinxes. Sherds in this group are stylistically early."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
