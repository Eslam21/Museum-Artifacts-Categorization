{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37326"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone striding figure of Takelot III, broken at the chest and lower legs. The king is shown with a bare upper body and an extremely narrowed waist. At the chest are the remains of a pectoral or amulet that was worn around the neck. His broad arms are held by the sides of the body, and in his left hand he holds a fragmentary piece of cloth. He wears a short shendyt kilt with a thick belt decorated with a cross-hatched pattern. The intact left upper leg strides forward ahead of the right leg. On the reverse is the upper section of a slim back-pillar inscribed with a column of text containing the royal name and titles of the king. Both of the arms are damaged around the sides, with the right hand now missing. The left side arm is also heavily damaged with much of the stone on the reverse now broken. The lower portion of the back-pillar is damaged and the base of the pillar now missing.

The king has been identified as Takelot I (Budge 1922; PM V) and Takelot II (Ayrton et al 1904), however more recent studies have proposed that the figure actually represents the later Takelot III (Brandl 2012). The surviving inscription includes both the throne name and birth name of the king, which appears to confirm that this indeed must be the later Takelot. The damaged amulet worn by the king is difficult to identify, but the right side detail of what could be a thorn piercing the main object resembles the \u2018double pouch\u2019 amulet worn by surviving images of Senwosret III (see for instance EA 36298, British Museum, London: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA36298).
