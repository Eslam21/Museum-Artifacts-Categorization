", " The lip pattern is as that on a Siana cup in Rhodes by the Red-Black Painter, Brijder 2000, pl. 179a. Schlotzhauer published the sherd as belonging to a South Ionian cup with everted rim belonging to his Type 9C. He comments on the excellent quality of the shape and slip; Attic and Ionian versions of cups with ivy and myrtle wreaths can be difficult to differentiate but he points out that the pattern on this cup is frequently found on Ionian versions and not so much on Attic cups. Whilst an analysis of the fabric has not been carried out, the colour of the fabric is closer to Attic than South Ionian.
