", " Petrie noted the presence of \u2018thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u2019 as well as unfinished vessels in alabaster from the temenos of Apollo at Naukratis (Petrie 1886, 15), indicating the mass-production of stone vessels in Naukratis. Syenite drill-cores were not observed amongst them, however. Tell Dafana, on the other hand, is known for its production of stone artefacts including syenite (Petrie 1888, 74 \u00a7 70 (esp. 18477 which should be a \"syenite\" drill-core); see also BM 1887,0101.691). There might have been a confusion between Naukratis and Tell Dafana. The drilling was performed by using a tube in copper alloy with abrasive, usually dry sand.
