{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85618"], "Description": [" Figurine of unfired clay depicting a stylized naked woman. Relatively thick plaque figure with a roughly rectangular patch of quite deep dots on its lower front face. One is fairly central and slightly rounder than the others and is perhaps a navel. Above, there is a slightly disruption in the surface of the clay, probably where applied breasts have become detached. The plaque tapers towards its top and is here broken away but with the remains of a small hole, about 1mm in diameter, suggesting that a head was once attached by means of a peg. The plaque flares out gently towards the base in both profile and section view, with the clay pinched out very slightly along the lower front face. It was probably able to stand upright. It is reasonably symmetrical, with quite flat faces. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica and many inclusions of small lime fragments. The sides and the back show several cracks. A shiny substance has been applied at parts of the front after excavation, causing a darker discolouration.
