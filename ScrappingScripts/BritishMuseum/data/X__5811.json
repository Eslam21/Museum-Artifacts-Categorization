This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This motif is common on scarabs of the Second Intermediate Period (for example: Petrie 1906, pl. IX, no. 188-189; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 360 no. 872; Ward 1978, 101; Tufnell 1984, 115, class 1B, pl. I, no. 1018), though several have been dated to the second half of the 20th-21st dynasties (Keel 1997, 528-9, no. 26; Magnarini 2004, 57-8, n\u00b001.05-6). Keel (Keel 1997, 401, 872) suggests that stylised netjer signs (sign used to write \u201cgod\u201d) are represented in the four corners. The poor treatment of the back and sides of that scarab is comparable to the hastily made scarabs of the 20th-21st dynasty (closests parallel for underside, general shape and treatment of the scarab: Magnarini 2004, 57, n\u00b001.05). The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
