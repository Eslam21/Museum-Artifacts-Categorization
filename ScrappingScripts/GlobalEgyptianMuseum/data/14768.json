The line of text on the right is translated as follows: \"I am he who surrounds the hidden place (tomb) with sand, I drive off him who would attack it. I light (with torch) the necropolis, I have traversed the way, for I am the magical protection.\" The left-hand line reads: \"O you who come to lasso, I will not let you lasso. O you who come to do harm, I will not let you do harm. I am the praised one by the good lord, Yuya, justified.\" The statuette is made of cedar wood and is completely enveloped in a wrapping like a mummy. The figure wears a striped wig with long lappets hanging to the chest, and a long false beard curved at the end like the sacred beards of the gods or the dead. The ears are left free to hear the prayers. The eyes and eyebrows are painted; the wide necklace is painted yellow, green and blue. The workmanship is excellent."}
