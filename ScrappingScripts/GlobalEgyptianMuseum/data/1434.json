It dates to the 3rd century AD, and shows the deceased Chairemonis in an attitude of prayer, with his palms raised. His facial features are remarkably close to those which are found in Coptic art. The rest of the stela combines Graeco-Roman and Egyptian themes. The Greek pediment is supported by Egyptian columns; inside the building, on either side of Chairemonis are a falcon and a jackal, the sacred animals of Horus and Anubis, the two funerary deities par excellence during the Roman Period. The inscription at the base of the stela mentions the name and age (28 years) of the owner."}
