Type 10 cups were mass produced and include numerous variants. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type V (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Vallet and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). Numerous Type 10 South Ionian cups have been found at Naukratis, as well as in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra and at Megara Hyblaea on Sicily, and at Berezan on the Black Sea (Posamentir 2006, 165). The cup was analysed by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, with NAA and the fabric was identified as a chemical singleton. Schlotzhauer suggests that the cup may have been found in a well in the sanctuary of Apollo, given its near completeness and the likelihood that it was left in a moist environment for a significant period of time."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer & Villing 2006 / East Greek Pottery from Naukratis: The Current State of Research (p.56 Table 1, Singles Nauk 5) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 53, no. 337, p. 102, NAU 53, pl. 12 a-b) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.693) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.1031"]}
