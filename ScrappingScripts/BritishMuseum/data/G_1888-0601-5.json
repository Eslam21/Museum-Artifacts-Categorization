{"artifact_name": "lamp-stand; candelabrum", "Object Type": [" lamp-stand ", " candelabrum "], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.5"], "Description": [" Bronze lamp-stand: tripod foot with lion's legs, much mended and one paw damaged; they converge on a ring-housing for the tapered tenon of the separately made fluted shaft, the top of which is broken away. The tenon of the shaft was brazed onto the foot in antiquity. A circular plate, now loose and broken in two, was once placed above the foot, supported by collar, also loose. The upper surface of the plate is divided into concentric bands, the inner one engraved with Bacchic features, including masks, thyrsoi and a syrinx. This frieze is surrounded by a narrow kymation band and an outer band with tendrils; the downturned rim is decorated with simple ovolos. A modern brass disc has now been soldered onto the tip of the tenon, to put less strain on the repairs.
