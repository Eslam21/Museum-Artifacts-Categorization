The smooth kilt emphasises the rounded contours of the buttocks. The arms originally were stretched out in front of the body, but only the start of the right arm and a small part of the left lower arm is preserved. Part of the upper surface of the side wall of the stela on the top right-hand side and the rounded upper edge are preserved. Part of the join between the legs is still visible on the inside of the left upper thigh. The back of the narrow back pillar is broken away."}
