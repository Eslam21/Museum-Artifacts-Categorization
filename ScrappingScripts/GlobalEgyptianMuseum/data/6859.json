{"Present location": "INSTITUT DE PAPYROLOGIE ET D'\u00c9GYPTOLOGIE, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LILLE III [02/049] LILLE", "Inventory number": "L 321", "Dating": "CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "AKSHA/SERRA WEST", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Diameter": "21 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Deep and narrow jar with a pronounced shoulder, small neck, thick lip and rounded conical base. The external surface is irregular and has been simply polished. Its colour varies from light red to dark pink and it is strewn with numerous white patches, most likely the result of the presence of carbonate. There are a few incised lines on the upper section of the body. The external surface of the lip is uneven. Like many others, this vessel, which was found in an A-Group tomb, demontrates the importance of trade between Upper and Lower Nubia during the end of the Predynastic period in Egypt. Vessels of this type, called ''wine jars'' by researchers, were used by the Egyptians to transport food products to Nubia. They were thereafter used by Nubians, who appreciated the technical qualities of the vessels and did not hesitate to place them in their tombs."}
