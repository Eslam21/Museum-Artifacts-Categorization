{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86162"], "Description": [" Scarab made of green faience, completely preserved, only part of the base chipped of. The head is separated from the prothorax by a simple line. Prothorax and elytra are indicated only by a small indent of the body form, also no suture visible. The clypeus is indicated by two incised lines, eyes not clearly visible but indicated by two slightly deeper impressions in the incised lines. The side shows two legs at each side on top of a base plate. In the front something that could be either the third leg or a part of the clypeus. The seal at the base does not show an oval framing line, but is incised with three columns of small hieroglyphs: in the left and right column each a mAa.t-feather over the full height, in the middle a sun-disc above a Dw, underneath a horizontal line (maybe n) above another sun-disc, this could be a corrupt writing of 'Imn-Ra. The perforation along its longitudinal side is fully preserved.
