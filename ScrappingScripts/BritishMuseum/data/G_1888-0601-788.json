According to Williams, the figure was probably a buttock-padded dancer and probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.502, 1888,0601.515 and 1888,0601.516. Williams argues that the image portrayed on the chalice was perhaps the representation of komos activities that took place in Chios. The buttock pads exaggerated the dancers\u2019 bottoms. The sakkos worn by many of these komasts as well as the earrings suggest the dancers, who were male, were practicing a form of transvestism. If so, these Chians dancers were precursors of the magodoi or performers who wore women\u2019s clothing, made lewd gestures and performed as female and drunk characters. The gestures of the dancers on the chalices are limited and consist of holding pomegranates, tambourines (or wreaths) and snapping fingers. Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5.
