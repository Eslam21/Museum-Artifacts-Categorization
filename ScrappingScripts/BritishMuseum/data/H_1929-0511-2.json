This object imitates the form of contemporary copper alloy flagons used by the Etruscans. This flagon is inlaid with coral and red glass 'enamel' at the foot, spout and handle. The body (including the sharply carinated shoulder and the neck) was beaten from a single sheet of copper alloy, and the foot collar, with its inlaid coral in place, was slipped over the bottom. The cast base was then put in place, with its edges turned up to cober the join at the sides. The beaked spout was set into a U-shaped cut-out in the body, and attached with rivets. The mouthplate was then affixed and turned over the top of the flagon, and the separatelty cast handle was also attached. The base was held in place by resin, which lines the whole of the flagon, and almost fills the poring spout. The vessel fittings are richly decorated. The handle is in the form of a dog or wolf, terminating below in a stylised human mask; two more canine figures ornament the lid. There is typical early La T\u00e8ne palmette decoration under the spout, and a small duck ornaments the end of the spout.

These two bronze flagons were found in 1927 with two Etruscan bronze stamoi (vessels used for mixing wine by the classical Greeks and the Etruscans in Italy). (Flagons: 1929,0511.1 and 2; Stamnoi: 1929,0510.1 and 1929,0511.3). The flagons are two of the finest examples of Early Celtic or Early La T\u00e8ne Art from anywhere in Europe. They were made in eastern France, but they copy the shape of bronze flagons made and used by the Etruscans in Italy at this time. The flagons were used for pouring wine, beer or mead at feasts. The grave where the objects were found was probably that of a very important person. Unfortunately it was dug up illegally, and not by archaeologists. Because of this little information survives about the grave or the other objects it contained. The flagons are inlaid with precious coral (now faded to white) from the Mediterranean coast, and red enamel (opaque red glass, probably from Asia Minor). They show a mixture of styles: the 'oriental' handles in the form of a dog or wolf was an idea from Greek or Etruscan art, but made in a local style; the palmette decorations under the spouts are a popular Celtic motif, though originally from Egypt, via Greece; the duck at the end of the spout is a purely native element of the decoration.
