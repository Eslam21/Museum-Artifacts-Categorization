These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.103) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.676"]}
