{"Present location": "ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM [06/002] AMSTERDAM", "Inventory number": "APM U.12663", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "LOW RELIEF", "Height": "12.6 cm", "Width": "13 cm", "Depth": "6.4 cm", "Name": "Relief fragment with adoring figures", "Description": "On the left-hand side, a kneeling male figure is depicted, with a long, pleated kilt, a broad collar and a long wig with the locks of hair in parallel rows. The arms (the hands are missing) are raised in a gesture of adoration. The fragment has broken off at the knee. Of a second figure to the right, only one adoring arm with a bracelet remains; the remainder of the figure is only summarily indicated: legs and a wide sleeve. The surface seems to be a little deeper at the place of the second figure. The relief may have been partly eroded, or left unfinished. The bottom and the right hand side are probably original, judging by their smoothness. The relief has been executed carefully and detailed."}
