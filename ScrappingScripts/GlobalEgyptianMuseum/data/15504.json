Eight flowers and eight buds are arranged around a central raised gold ornament that forms a rosette at the bottom of the bowl. Twenty wavy lines radiate from this central piece toward the rim, where they curve back to rejoin their neighbors. The movable gold handle is held in place by two thick rings of a flat, thin piece of metal that is riveted to the body."}
