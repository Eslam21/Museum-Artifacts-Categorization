", " Lemos places this sherd in Stage 2 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless. The vases in Stage 2 have even more basic rosettes than the vases from Stage 1. Furthermore, the deterioration of the Sphinx and Lion Style appears quite clearly in the execution of the face of the different figures. Williams (2006a, 128) notes that Chian dinos sherds are often mistaken for oinochoai because of the lack of slip on the interior surface. Moignard in CVA Edinburgh identifies the sherd as coming from a closed vessel because of the lack of slip on the sherd's interior surface.
