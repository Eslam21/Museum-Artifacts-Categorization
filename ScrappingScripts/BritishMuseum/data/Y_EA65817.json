{"artifact_name": "collar", "Object Type": ["collar"], "Museum number": ["EA65817"], "Description": [" Glazed composition lotus blossom necklace terminal: that expands on the basic floral motif with the addition of a band of text. The moulded glazed composition ground into which the petals and hieroglyphs were inlaid is white, a colour possibly used to imitate silver. The blossom itself is largely composed of dark blue glazed composition inlays pressed into the white ground like the hieroglyphs. Yellow, green, and red inlays complete the blossom and impart a sense of nature and liveliness.

This multi-strand ornament, based on real garlands and worn by both sexes, was often made of vibrantly coloured glazed composition pendants in the form of fruits, blossoms, and leaves. The terminals, or end pieces, of the necklace were frequently stylized blue lotus blossoms. These elements were triangular in shape and pierced along the underside of the broad, flat plane at the petal tips, where the various strings were gathered to exit the hole at the rounded apex. In keeping with the preference for elaborate 'weskhet' collars during the Eighteenth Dynasty, this terminal probably had eleven piercings along the edge beneath the inscription to accommodate the same number of strings. Fragments of comparable terminals with inscriptions dedicated to Amenhotep III suggest a common workshop, skilled in making polychrome glazed composition pieces. Bibliography: C.
