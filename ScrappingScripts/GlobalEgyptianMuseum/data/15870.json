{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 19323", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "PAPYRUS", "Material": "PAPYRUS", "Technique": "DRAWING; PAINTED", "Name": "Book of the Dead of Her-weben-khet", "Description": "The Book of the Dead of the Lady Her-weben-khet, the Chantress of Amun, is read from right to left and has a scene with two registers, or sections, showing her worshiping the souls of Pe and Nekhen. This is followed by a scene of the solar boat, in which the god Re-Horakhty is depicted seated in a shrine, while the god Seth is standing at the front and spearing a huge snake, the symbol of cosmic disorder. The most striking scene of this papyrus is a portrayal of Lady Her-weben-khet kneeling with arms upraised in prayer in front of the solar deity in the form of a ram. The strongly built shape of the body of the deceased exemplifies a new image for the female figure in this period. It contrasts with the slender images that were in vogue earlier."}
