Its colour varies from beige to very light pink and was not covered with a slip. The slightly irregular surface is strewn with blemishes as a result of firing. It had been simply smoothened and many vertical, horizontal and diagonal traces remain. Six small circular hollow impressions, 4 mm in diametre and 2 cm apart, were made on about a quarter of the top surface of the lip. Like many others, this vessel, which was found in an A-Group tomb, demonstrates the importance of trade between Upper and Lower Nubia during the end of the Predynastic period in Egypt. Vessels of this type, called ''wine jars'' by researchers, were used by the Egyptians to transport food products to Nubia. They were thereafter used by Nubians, who appreciated the technical qualities of the vessels and did not hesitate to place them in their tombs."}
