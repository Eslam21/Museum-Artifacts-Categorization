{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86701"], "Description": [" Comparatively large seal-impression with two rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side one further rows, showing that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. There are some traces from a string as well. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica and was hardened after excavation. The front wears many finger impressions around the oval impressions of a scarab-like seal. The motif is very worn, there is a circumferential line, several unrecognizable signs at the left and a cartouche at the right. There might be a thicker framing line on the right.
