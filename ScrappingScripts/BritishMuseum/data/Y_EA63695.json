{"artifact_name": "anklet; bead; pendant; amulet", "Object Type": [" anklet ", " bead ", " pendant ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA63695"], "Description": [" An anklet: composed of beads, an amulet and two pendants. One of the pendants, which is long and resembles an unmarked snake's head amulet, is of translucent dark sea-green olivine with black flecks; the other pendant is drop-shaped and made of cornelian. Seven of the beads are large, flat, lenticular and oval; two have distinct ridges along their edges. All are made of translucent green calcite or white calcite. A rectangular bead with rounded corners, flat underside and convex upper surface is of malachite. There are twenty disc, short cylindrical and short truncated convex bicone beads: nine are of rock crystal, eight of calcite, two of green fluorite and one of shell. There is one oblate bead of faded green feldspar and one tiny disc bead of the same material. One long barrel is of mottled dark-green steatite, one long cylinder of black steatite and one flattened long cylinder of brown, semi-translucent steatite. The hedgehog amulet is made of calcite. Cornelian barrel and cylindrical disc beads, two much-faceted short truncated convex bicone beads and three semi-circular tabular beads make up the remainder of the anklet.
