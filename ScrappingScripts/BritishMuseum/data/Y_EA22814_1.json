{"artifact_name": "coffin", "Object Type": ["coffin"], "Museum number": ["EA22814"], "Description": [" Base and lid of an anthropoid outer coffin of Seshepenmehyt: made of sycomore fig wood, with elaborate polychrome painted decoration. A winged solar disc covers the right breast, and below, a narrow scene showing the weighing of the deceased's heart (at right). At the level of the knees, Anubis is represented mummifying the deceased as she lies on a bier, while figures of other deities give symbolic protection. The area is densely inscribed with short columns of text interspersed among these images, and there is a large painted inscription around the sides and the base. On the interior of the case is a large mummiform figure grasping a 'was' sceptre and wearing the 'atef' crown. The deity represented is Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. He is flanked by Isis and Nephthys and has a solar disc above his head. The thickness of the coffin is painted with a checkered pattern.
