They were listed in the 1837 inventory under the numbers Kk,6.1 to 162 and were also registered as 1834,0712.1 to 162. Both the 1834,0712 and the Kk,6 numbers have been used in the past, but it is too disruptive to change them now as so many have been mounted. Instead on every record the alternative number has been entered as an additional number. The 162 prints were all sold on 19 June 1834; Ottley bought 20 lots in that day's sale and the total price paid by the BM was \u00a395 17s 6d. Ottley seems to have done the bidding at the sale in person.
