Bezold and E.W. Budge, \u2018The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, (London 1892), 42, pl. 4; J.A. Knudtzon, \u2018Die El-Amarna-Tafeln\u2019 vol. 1, (Leipzig, 1907), pp. 451-3; W.L. Moran, \u2018The Amarna Letters\u2019 (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 172-3. In this letter from the the small city state Irqata and its elders to the king of Egypt, they refer to the unnamed pharaoh as \u2018our lord, the Sun\u2019; the entire letter is submissive in nature and seems seek to reassure the Egyptian king of Irqata\u2019s loyalty, which came into question after they gave gifts to the rival kingdom of Mittani. They defend themselves by noting that the Mitanni had fought their enemies, who killed the king of Irqata, and they ask for assistance from Egypt in this war. Irqata is identified with Tell \u2018Arqa in the \u2018Akkar Plain of Syria. This clay tablet was found in the modern city of el-Amarna (ancient Akhetaten) along with over 350 others, the majority being diplomatic letters. They are written in cuneiform script, which served as the language of international relations at the time. The Amarna letters concern diplomatic relations between Egypt and both large rival empires and small vassal city states, and deal with matters such as economic exchange, diplomatic marriages, and military threats."], "Bibliographic references": [" Knudtzon, J A 1915a / Die El-Amarna Tafeln (100) ", " Bezold 1892a / The El-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum (42) ", " Leichty E et al 1988a / Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, volume VIII: Tablets from Sippar 3 (p.175) ", " Sigrist M et al 2006a / Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, III "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2011 Jul\u2013Sept, Newcastle, Great North Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Oct\u2013Jan, Dorchester, Dorset County Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Feb\u2013June, Leeds City Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Jul-Oct, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Nov\u2013 Feb 2013, Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2013 Mar\u2013Aug, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2016 8 Mar\u201312 Jun, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018 7 Jun\u201316 Sep, Barcelona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018-2019 16 Oct\u201320 Jan, Madrid, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019 19 Feb\u201325 Aug, Girona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019-2020 24 Sept\u201312 Jan, Seville, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2020\u20132021 11 Feb\u201321 Feb, Tarragona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2021 25 Mar\u201315 Aug, Santiago de Compostela, Museo Centro de Gaias, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2021-2022 15 Sep\u20139 Jan, Zaragoza, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2022 10 Feb\u201315 May, Palma, La Caixa, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2022-2023 21 Jun\u201326 Feb, Valencia, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2023 29 Mar\u201323 Jul, Lleida, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt "], "Condition": ["Good / fair; nearly complete."], "Acquisition name": ["From: Sir Ernest A T Wallis Budge"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased by Budge in Egypt."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "BM/Big number": ["E29825"], "Registration number": ["1888,1013.13"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: EA 100 "]}
