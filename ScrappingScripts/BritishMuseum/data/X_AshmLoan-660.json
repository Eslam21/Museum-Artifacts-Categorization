", " Lemos places this sherd in Group A of the Sphinx and Lion Style. The decoration on the vases from this group is the most elaborate. The rosette has a standard cogwheel shape and the figures are carefully drawn and details are expertly incised. Williams (2006a, 128) notes that Chian dinos sherds are often mistaken for oinochoai because of the lack of slip on the interior surface. The thickness of the sherd suggests it was a large vessel.
