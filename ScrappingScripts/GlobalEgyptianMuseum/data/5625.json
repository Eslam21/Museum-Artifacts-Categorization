The deep back pillar is very wide at elbow height and tapers and narrows towards the top of the crown. When the head was reunited with the body, the neck and part of the back pillar were restored; otherwise this piece is almost complete.A date in the Ramesside Period or the 3rd Intermediate Period cannot be ruled out. It is also possible that this statuette (or maybe just the head) is the work of a modern imitator."}
