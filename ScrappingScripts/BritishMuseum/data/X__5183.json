", " A number of \u2018symplegma\u2019 erotic figure groups involving a youth with a side-lock (Harpocrates or a follower) and his consort were found at Naukratis and have also been found in Lower Egypt. Various materials were used (terracotta, limestone and faience were most common) and different versions, both plaques and three dimensional figures, of different compositions are known. Limestone symplegma plaques known from Naukratis (Egyptian Museum, Cairo TR14/9/18/13; JE33557; see also British Museum GR 1888,0601.78). A second, more common, variant, has more three dimensional figures, known from Naukratis (GR1965,0930.976, 1965,0930.932, 1965,0930.943; see also Cambridge MCA NA307) and attributed to Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.84.1914, E.SU.150, E.128.1914; British Museum GR2011,5011.9).
