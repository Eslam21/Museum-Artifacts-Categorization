Speedy accompanied Sir Rennell Rodd\u2019s diplomatic mission to meet Emperor Menelik II in 1897 and it is possible he could have received the hat at this time. However, in photographs Af,B7.21, Af,B7.22, Af,B7.29 Speedy can be seen wearing this hat. These photographs are dated to 1868. The images therefore provide an earlier date for Speedy's possession of this hat. Af1912,0410.1-81 were donated by Cornelia Mary Speedy, widow of Captain Tristram Speedy. We cannot now precisely identify when most objects entered his collection. The donor noted that during his travels Captain Speedy \u2018brought to England many Abyssinian curios\u2019 (see letter from Cornelia Mary Speedy, 27th February 1912 in Collection File Af1912,0410.1-81). Captain Speedy made four separate visits to Abyssinia (now Ethiopia and Eritrea). In 1861-1862, he visited Emperor Tewodros II\u2019s court. He participated in the Abyssinian Campaign 1867-68 as interpreter for Robert Napier. In 1884, he accompanied Admiral Sir William Hewett\u2019s mission to Adwa to meet with Emperor Yohannes IV. In 1897, he accompanied the Rennell-Rodd mission to Addis Ababa to meet Emperor Menelik. He also made two visits to Sudan, in the early 1860s and 1878. Nos. 1 to 59 are all recorded as from Abyssinia [Ethiopia]; Nos 60 to 79 come from Sudan, Egypt or Malaya. Registration details are based on recollections provided by Cornelia Mary Speedy and may not be accurate (see lists in Collection File Af1912,0410.1-81)."], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["Af1912,0410.13"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 08 Jan 2008"]}
