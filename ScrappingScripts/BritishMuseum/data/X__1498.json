{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of beardless man (?) wearing festival wreath. 'Grotesque' style male head, broken from a figure, with a deep furrow on the brow and the hair and the ears barely indicated; a tightly woven wreath rings the head, which was made separately from the body, with a short peg for insertion into it. It is solid; probably from a two-piece mould, with the wreath perhaps added after removal from the mould. Traces of red paint (?). Red-brown Nile silt with a grey core abundant mica, quartz, organics and limestone inclusions.
