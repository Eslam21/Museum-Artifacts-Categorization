The message reads: \"A P.C. [postcard] for your collection. Have passed thro' [through] the Suez Canal & have reached middle of the Red Sea. A blazing hot day & very little improvement tonight\". The card is signed by one Cyril Ponting. The message is very typical of postcards written on the long Red Sea voyage between Cairo and Aden (as the content and place of production of the card implies), but the opening sentence is particularly appropriate for the present context of a card for the British Museum's postcard collection."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Very good."], "Subjects": ["street-trader"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Cyril Ponting ", " Named in inscription: Miss J Drake "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Cairo (city) "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Peters Postcards"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Acquisition notes": ["Acquired Bloomsbury fair, 24th November 2013."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["EPH-ME.1729"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 545 (printed postcard number) "]}
