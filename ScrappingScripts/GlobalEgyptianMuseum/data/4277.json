His right hand holds a curved knife up against his shoulder, the other hangs straight down at his side. He wears the characteristic flat-topped helmet in which is a small hole, probably to facilitate the attachment of a further crown or the double plumes. In addition to the armlets, bracelets and collar the god has an ornamental belt around his chest, held in place by straps that pass over the shoulders. The face is delicately modelled and the beard is plaited."}
