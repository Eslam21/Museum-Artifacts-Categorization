{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74719"], "Description": [" Portrait of a girl in encaustic on limewood with added gilt: the wooden panel is cracked in several places. Much of the greyish background is lost. There are impressions of textiles on the nose and brow of the figure. Traces of the mummy wrappings appear as a diagonal line at the lower right corner. The young girl wears a dark red tunic and bluish-green mantle and perhaps a bluish-black scarf with bobbles resting on her proper right shoulder. Traces of a violet clavus appear on the tunic to the right of this garment. Around the neck is a brownish red thong, perhaps of leather (no trace remains of gilding), with pendant crescent. The hair is cut close to the head with locks perhaps extending down the neck behind the proper left ear. A gilded wreath on red-brown ground with lozenge-shaped leaves appears in the hair across the crown of the head. The eyes are very large, with prominent upper lashes and fine arched eyebrows. Much of the surface colour is lost; warm peach and pinkish tones survive. The lips are orangey red and were most likely repainted.

It is likely that the painting was retouched in recent times, especially in the area of the mouth and neck; the former feature does not relate well to the nose and eyes, and in both areas paint was found within the cracks in the wood. It is, however, likely that the original painting is Claudian or Neronian work. Bibliography: K. Parlasca, 'Ritratti di Mummie'. In A.
