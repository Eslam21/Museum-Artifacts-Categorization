The hair hangs loose on the back, crowned with a kind of fillet with rosettes, Bes-figures and a udjat-eye. The dress is decorated with multicoloured rectangular patterns, and vines and rosettes between the lines. It is bound up under the breasts, the pleats are symmetrical. The girl wears earrings, bracelets, rings on almost all fingers, a collar consisting of a flowered band with stylized petals, and two necklaces. The uppper necklace is decorated with a Hathor-crown. The nipples (also the covered one) are expanded into rosettes. The face and the bare part of the chest are gilded, as is some of the jewellery. There are traces of sandal straps on the feet. The body features, which are discernible through the dress, are carefully modelled."}
