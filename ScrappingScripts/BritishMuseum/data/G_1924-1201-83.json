Fragmentary kalathos broken from figure of Isis-Hathor, together with parts of the wreaths that encircled her head. The kalathos has a scalloped edge. The kalathos is painted green with thin vertical lines in black paint; subsequent to this a white dressing was inexpertly applied to the wreaths, and presumably the whole figure, with a little inside the kalathos. Some pink paint on the lower part of the wreaths survives. Constructed in a hollow, from a two-piece mould. Red-brown Nile silt with a grey core, common mica and white inclusions.
