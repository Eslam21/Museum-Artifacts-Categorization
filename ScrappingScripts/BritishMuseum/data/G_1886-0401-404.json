Mommsen (Bonn) (see Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006: 55, Table 1; Sample NAUK 51). Analysis of the fabric placed it in Group EMEB with a place of production in the region of the Knidian peninsula and recent excavations in the Sanctuary of Apollo at Emecik on the Knidian peninsula have also produced several examples of these types of cups (Attula 2005, 144, pl. 78, 297-9). The reserved handle zone on this sherd is much narrower than on 1886,0401.96 and thus fits with Hayes' Rhodian Cup Type VI i from Tocra (Boardman and Hayes 1966 112-3). Hayes dated these cups to the late-seventh and early-sixth centuries BC. However, if his Type VI ii are dated earlier, as suggested by Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012 161), then both of these cups belong to the earliest period of Greek occupation at the site."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
