", " For a parallel, see the hydria in Moscow, Pushkin Museum 1b 1364 in Boardman, J., Early Greek Vase Painting. London 1998, 171, fig. 345. Cook suggests that the black and white cranes are reminiscent of those found on vases from the T\u00fcbingen Group. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) found great similarities with the fabric from Wild Goat Style sherds found at Bayrakli in Asia Minor, production of which Dupont had attributed to Clazomenae. Based on the similar composition types, Dupont then suggested that the place of production for this sherd ought to be situated near Clazomenae, Erythrae, or Teos (Jones with J. Boardman in Jones 1986, p.664).
