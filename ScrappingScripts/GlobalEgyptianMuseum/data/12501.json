On his head are the nemes-head dress and the nome-standard (hieroglyph Gardiner N24). Unfortunately, the nome-sign itself has disappeared. The god wears a loin cloth, armlets and bracelets. A band is tied across his chest. His outstreched arms, of which the right one especially is proportionally too long, carry a tray with a some objects: a jug of beer, a bundle of papyrus stalks, a loaf of bread, a spouted jug and another bundle of stalks. A kind of ribbons(?) hang down from his hands. This type of fertility or Nile deities is usually depicted as very well-fed males, but this one has near female breasts, and may be androgynous."}
