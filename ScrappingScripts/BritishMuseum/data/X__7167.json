", " Piekarski's comparanda relate to banqueters with drinking cups (CVA Altenburg (2) 13F pl. 56; CVA Madrid (2) III I D ( pl. 14.3a) and Dionysos holding a kantharos with satyrs and maenads (Louvre G433 (ARV2 1342, 1 = CVA Paris (8) III I H 30f pl. 43, 6-11)). On the Bonn fragment, it is not clear who holds the kantharos, although it is likely that it is the reclining figure (probably Dionysos, but possibly Herakles). For Dionysos reclining (on a billy goat) holding out a kantharos, see the stammos Louvre G 185 (ARV2 207, 142; Berard, etc., A City of Images 1989, fig. 177), Berlin Painter, about 500 BC. For the concave-sided kantharos, see Munich 2384 (Boardman ARFV Classical fig. 162), a calyx krater of the Polygnotan Group. If, as it appears from the photograph, there are supports for the handles, compare the kantharos, BM 1864, 1007.78 (E157) which does, however, have a longer stem (ARV2 1213.2: Alexandre Group; Boardman ARFV Classical, fig. 225) dated 430-420 BC.
