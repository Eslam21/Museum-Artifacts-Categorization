This is the first coral necklace I have heard of from Egypt. A few beads, similar, but rather fresher in colour, were also found in the town, and are now in Bulak; a couple of beads were in the best necklace which I found at San of Ptolemaic age, and stray beads have occasionally been brought over from Egypt.\u2019 (Petrie 1886, 40).
