The lotus flower and lotus bud pattern found on these vessels appears on the wall of the vases and in the later vases the pattern resembles that found on Fikellura vases. However this sherd belongs to the lower body of the chalice, and lotus flower and bud patterns are normally found on Wild Goat Style chalices, not those in the Chalice Style. The probable lack of interior decoration also suggests that the sherd belongs in the Wild Goat Style, although the possible traces of added white bands on the interior suggest that the sherd might be late in the Wild Goat Style. Lemos also identifies this sherd as coming from a phiale mesomphalos, but the shape is distinctly that of a chalice."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
