{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8483"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Sehemmut (?): this round-topped stela is divided into three registers. The upper register has a winged sun-disk with uraei. In the second register the deceased female stands on the right with arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a lotus. Behind it stand Ra-Horakhty and the four sons of Horus. There are four lines of text at the bottom. The stela is poorly preserved. The wood is blackened and cracked, rendering many features indistinguishable. The registers were separated by multi-coloured borders of which only the red rectangles and the black and white stripes are now clear. The sun-disk was red and the lower wings and uraei were green or yellow. The female figure apparently had a red dress. The hieroglyphs at the bottom are black. The right edge had been broken off, but is now rejoined to the stela. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 25th Dynasty (?) ", " 26th Dynasty (?)
