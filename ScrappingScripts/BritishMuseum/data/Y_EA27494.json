{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA27494"], "Description": [" Long, narrow arsenical bronze axe-head: with slightly incurved sides and elliptical shaft-hole socket. The edges of the socket are ribbed, and it has a large spur-like projection on either side at the rear and two smaller projections correspondingly positioned at the front, one of which is slightly hooked. The blade has been completely cleaned. There is considerable corrosion damage. The socket is holed at one point on the edge and is severely pitted inside. One of the rear spurs is cracked and one of the front spurs is a little eroded. Worst affected is the distal end, where the surfaces are badly pitted and the cutting edge eaten away.
