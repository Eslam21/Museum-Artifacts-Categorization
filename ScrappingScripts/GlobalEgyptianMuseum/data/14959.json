The pegs were probably for stirring food. It is likely that stirrers such as this were used to grind seeds or vegetables or to mix pastry for the cakes that were cooked for the king, as shown on the walls of the tomb of King Ramesses the Third, in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes. Bakers are using these stirrers to make cakes in different shapes such as lying cows or spiral rolls."}
