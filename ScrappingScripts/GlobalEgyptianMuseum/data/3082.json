The figure is crudely modelled with little detail. There are vertical lines of text down all sides, written in ink. These stick shabtis all come from Dira' abu el-Naga on the West Bank at Thebes and date to the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties. The text tells us that they were dedicated by relatives, some also have an abbreviated form of the shabti spell written on them."}
