", " According to pottery analysis by P. Dupont (personal communication, 30-31 May 1978) at the Centre de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques, laboratoire de c\u00e9ramologie, Lyon, the clay from this sherd originated in Chios. The accession number used in the clay analysis, 'NAU 39', is written in ink on the break. The decoration on the lower body, though very worn, is consistent with the patterned chalices. The interior decoration is minimal suggesting that it is early.
