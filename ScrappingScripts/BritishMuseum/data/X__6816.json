", " According to the Egypt Exploration Fund list, the Redpath Museum received in 1887 several \"paste objects\" from the Scarab Factory, along with two moulds. This amulet might come from such a context. Taweret is well represented in the faience amulets from Naukratis (Masson forthcoming a). Associated with the protection of pregnancy and child birth (Andrews 1994, 40; Herrmann et al. 2010, 80-82), Taweret amulets are already documented in the Old Kingdom (Ferrari 1996, 40) and are particularly common in Egyptian settlements of the Late and Ptolemaic Periods (for example: Giddy 1992, pl. 52, 78/1, pl. 53, 78/85, pl. 77, 78/1, 78/85; Wilson 1982, 30, pl.
