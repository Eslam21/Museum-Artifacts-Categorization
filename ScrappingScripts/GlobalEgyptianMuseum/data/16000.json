The center of the capital is decorated with a bound three-leaved lotus flower. It was used in the Coptic Church as a baptismal font. The artist made the bowl of the font resemble a mother's womb because, in Coptic belief, immersing children in the baptismal font gives them a second birth. At the bottom of the capital is a hole through which the baptismal water was drained."}
