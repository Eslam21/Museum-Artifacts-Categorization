{"artifact_name": "inlay", "Object Type": ["inlay"], "Museum number": ["EA32652"], "Description": [" A piece of ivory inlay: decorated on the face with vertical ribbing, broken off at the base. The back is cut into a dovetail tenon for secure fixing. One edge is rebated so that the decorated face extends beyond the rear of the tile, and the opposite edge is cut in the reverse manner, with the carved face inset, probably to allow a series of such pieces to be fitted together with overlapped joints.
