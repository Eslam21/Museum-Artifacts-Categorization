{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "3400", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM (not before); LATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FAYENCE", "Width": "1.66 cm", "Depth": "1.28 cm", "Name": "Heart amulet", "Description": "The heart amulet represents and protects the heart of the deceased, just like the heart scarab. This type of amulet may well be inscribed with spell 30B of the Book of the Dead as well, and its importance is reflected in the fact that it is one of the most common amulets found. It was used as a mummy amulet from the 2nd Intermediate Period until well into the Ptolemaic Period. There were no restrictions as far as the material used was concerned. Faience, like this example, was rarely used, however. "}
