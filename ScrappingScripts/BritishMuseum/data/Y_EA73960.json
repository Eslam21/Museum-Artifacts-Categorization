{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA73960"], "Description": [" Fragmentary rose granite standing figure of Mersuankh, the upper body now missing. The lower legs show that the figure originally adopted a striding pose, with the left leg advancing forward ahead of the right. The legs and feet are broad in size. Beside the left foot on top of the statue base is a brief crudely carved inscription. On the reverse is the lower portion of a wide back-pillar, which does not appear to be inscribed. There are chips to the stone surface around the left side of the base, and the reverse is also damaged across both corners of the base.
