Pious worshippers whisper their prayers and petitions near the ears of specific deities, particularly Ptah or Amun-Re.Here is a good example of a stela that contains scenes and texts for the deity \"Amun-Re, the beautiful ram,\" another form of the sun god who is shown here as two rams facing each other at the top. They are wearing the two tall plumes and the cobras upon their heads. In the middle, there is a brazier and a libation vase. The person to the left is the owner of the stela whose name is Bay. He was a \"Servant in the Place of Truth,\" a common title given to artisans and craftsmen who were working in the Theban Necropolis (west of modern Luxor) during the New Kingdom. They were in charge of constructing and decorating the temples and tombs. Bay is shown kneeling in adoration towards three large pairs of ears. The ears belong to the god Amun-Re who could hear the peoples' petitions for healing, help them in mastering their profession, and support them in whatever they asked him."}
