In ancient Egypt, crocodiles could be found everywhere in the water and were greatly feared. Because of the fear they generated, they were attributed with protective powers. It thus became a sacred animal and was venerated especially in the Faiyum as the god Sobek. The hole in the head was probably meant for affixing an atef-crown of a different material, presumably gold."}
