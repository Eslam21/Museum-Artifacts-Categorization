F. Petrie at Deir Ganadla at the south of Asiut and probably dates from the 7th century. It bears a Coptic inscription of 11 lines. The text constitutes an invocation of God and  several saints in favour of a certain Jeremy, originally of Sip village. This type of text is characteristic of stelae coming principally from Saqqara and from Deir Ganadla. Only the choice of called upon saints indicates their exact provenance."}
