{"artifact_name": "statue; bust", "Object Type": [" statue ", " bust "], "Museum number": ["EA14392"], "Description": [" Limestone head of a king, a sculptor\u2019s model or trial piece. The king wears the nemes headcloth, with a uraeus ornament representing the coiled body of a cobra placed at the centre, its head now missing. His eyes are narrow with thin incised lines indicating the upper eyelids, and thin strips in raised relief indicating the eyebrows. His nose has broken off, but its outline on the right side is preserved. The lips are curved into a gentle smile. The face is round and fleshy, particularly around the mouth and jaw. The reverse is a flat surface that appears to be undecorated, with a modern label in faded black ink of \u2018Benha 1871\u2019. In addition to numerous breaks around the nemes cloth, uraeus and the nose, there are various small chips across the face and neck. The object is now attached to a modern rectangular base.

Despite its damaged state, this model is of a particularly high quality. Such models were used as a visual aid to ensure the production of an even three-dimensional sculpture; on the reverse, this area typically includes an incised proportional grid, though this is not the case with this piece. Though originally dated to the Late Period, the stylistic facial features and smaller proportions of the \u2018pendant\u2019 shape of the uraeus are more indicative of a Ptolemaic date. For the significance of the \u2018pendant snake\u2019 as opposed to the usually raised uraeus, see Hill (2007).Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain.
