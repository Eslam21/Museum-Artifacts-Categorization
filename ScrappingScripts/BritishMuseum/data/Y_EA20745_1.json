Two beads were placed on his forehead, and a metal amulet at the back of his mouth. Chest and Abdomen - Some packing material including four oblong packages, probably enclosing organs.

His father Ankhwennefer was \"Second Prophet\" of the god, a post which suggests that the family enjoyed high status. This is certainly borne out by the rich trappings of Irethoreru's mummy.
