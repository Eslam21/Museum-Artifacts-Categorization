The decoration is quite worn and is inside a single line border that is smaller than the actual stela. In the arch at the top are a pair of udjat-eyes, underneath which are two horizontal lines of inscription. Below this is a scene showing the deceased seated on a chair on the left with a woman standing and facing him. Between them is a table of offerings and behind the woman is the kneeling figure of a smaller female. Groups of inscription around the figures presumably give us their names and titles.In the second register are three kneeling figures, two female and one male, all facing to the right, again with small inscriptions. In the third register are the figures of three men (?), again all facing right."}
