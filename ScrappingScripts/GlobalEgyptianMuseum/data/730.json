It shows the god Horus as a naked child placing his feet on two crocodiles and holding other savage animals in his hands. Above his head appears a mask representing the traits of the protector god Bes. At the height of his shoulders are found the seated figures of Osiris and Isis. The reverse of the stela contains three registers of processions of divinities followed by prophylactic formulae written in 22 horizontal lines. According to the Egyptians, stelae of this type assured magical protection against all dangerous animals."}
