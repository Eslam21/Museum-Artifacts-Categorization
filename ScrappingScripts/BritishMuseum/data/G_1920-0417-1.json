Petrie listed a number of amulet-moulds including moulds for wedjat eyes of different types (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 16-17). This specimen comes probably from the Scarab Factory, though it is crudely modelled in a grey-brown clay which is different from that of the majority of the scarab and amulet moulds from Naukratis. Workmanship is also crude. So should be careful about its origin and date. For a rather similar type of mould: BM 1888,0601.748. Gorton, A.
