This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Made in Naukratis at the terracottas workshop there. A number of Harpocrates from the same, or very similar, mould series were found at Naukratis (Gutch 1898-9; 92 n.5, pl.13, no.191; British Museum Bailey 2008, no.3060 GR1886,0401.1442; Bristol H2814; Cambridge NA629; Boston MFA 86.438, possibly 86.461; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1846). Variants of this macrophallic reclining Harpocrates with side knot type has been found in Saqqara as well as the Naukratis workshop area and have been dated to the 3rd and 2nd century BC (Bailey 2008, no. 3058-60; see also 3rd century BC parallel from Tell Atrib, Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 53). However, others have dated good parallels to the Late Hellenistic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 72, see no.62) and Roman (1st to 2nd century AD) periods (Fischer 1994, no.575 see also 633; Dunand 1990, nos. 117, 281; Dunand 1979, no.135; Bayer Niemeier 1988, no.51). Variants have been found at Theadelphia (Weber 1914: no. 60) or unprovenanced (Sotheby\u2019s Sale Catalogue, 18 May 1987, lot 113) and they were making similar examples in a terracotta shop at Memphis (Engelbach et al. 1915, pl. 61, no. 45(1)).
