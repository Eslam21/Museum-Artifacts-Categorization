On its back, the clypeus is engraved in shale, surrounded by remains of a blue green enamel paste. The prothorax and elytra are carved in the enamel. Small vertical incisions were made on the left side in order to create legs, now barely visible. On the reverse side, there are several prophylactic signs of unknown significance. The sides, most particularly the right side, were repolished as a result of which all the  incisions have disappeared. The suspension hole pierces the scarab longitudinally."}
