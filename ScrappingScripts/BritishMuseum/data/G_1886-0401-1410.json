{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1410"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure. Head broken off from the figure of an actor playing a slave character in the New Comedy. Actor's mask indicated by a raised edge around chin and head, with the actor's own hair showing below. The hair of the mask is peaked at the front and combed back on the top and each side; there is a large trumpet-mouth, heavy eyebrows and a furrowed forehead. The method of manufacture is uncertain: it is solid, probably made in a two-piece mould, with any traces of mould-lines obscured by considerable subsequent hand-tooling of the surface. The head was then added to its (now) lost body before firing. Traces of an overall white dressing and pink paint on skin and black details around the eyes. Red-brown Nile silt with frequent fine gold mica, white and quartz inclusions.
