{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86268"], "Description": [" Complete scarab, made of blue frit. Half of the upper part is missing. Almost no decoration on the back, but on the right side two short horizontal lines, probably indicating the division between prothorax and elytra. Head and eyes not preserved but one plate in a triangular shape with small askew lines is visible. The side shows only one incised line separating it into base and upper part, no legs indicated. The lines are not running completely around the object. The seal at the base shows faint traces of a circumferential line. Standing figure with a falcon head, facing to the right. The right arm is shown along the body, the left arm is winged and raised up, the inner part shows small parallel lines, on the outside the tips of three feathers indicated. Also the inner part of the apron shows horizontal lines. In front of the figure a sign that looks like the lower part of a wAs-sceptre, joining the wing in the upper part. In front of this a small oval another sign, maybe sA or a squashed sun disc. On top of the figure another sign, maybe the horizon Akh (N27). Maybe a word play for R'-Hr-Akhty? Perforated along its longitudinal side.
