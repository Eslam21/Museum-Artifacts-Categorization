{"artifact_name": "bowl; figure", "Object Type": [" bowl ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1508"], "Description": [" Gypsum alabaster (calcium sulphate) tripod shallow cosmetics bowl fragment with legs in the form of a siren carrying a child at her breast. Fragment of only about one third of the shallow basin is preserved, two of the three supporting figures are missing; the preserved siren is missing the head and the figure in her arms is lacking head and upper body. The upper part of the left wing has been replaced by a piece from the edge of the bowl. There are possible traces of smoke residue visible. The missing parts were replaced by a modern plaster cast. The shallow basin has a flat lip, around the edge of which a plastically rendered tongue pattern (Eierstab) is running. Three figures were holding up the basin originally, of which one remains in the form of a Siren with long curving wings, carrying a child at her breast. The widely spread wings are supporting the bottom of the basin. The head is missing; long tresses fall on the shoulders. The upper part is female with a sleeved garment visible; the lower part is scaled while ending in a bird's tail. On the left side, the body ends in the egg-like form; on the right side, the tail is shown in relief above the feathers. The human figure held by the siren like a child is wearing a long chiton; the legs are angled and the arms were held up towards the siren's upper body.

The second group were likely used as containers for cosmetics or toiletries vessels and have been dated 550-525BC (H\u00f6ckmann 2007, N37, 190-191, type 5, style group 4). A broader date range of 575-525BC is suggested for the former group. The basin's form has been attested according to other examples to belong to the Ionian area (Smith 1892, no.116; Bulk, 35; Conze 1895, 106; Bulle 1900, 35; von Fritz 1894a, 74; von Fritz 1894b, 733; Perrot and Chipiez 1903, 336; Weicker 1902, 126; Belin de Ballu 1972, 43-44; Floren 1987, 409; Wild 1988, 426). A parallel from Olbia suggests that all examples had identical tripod legs and likely also a lid (H\u00f6ckmann 2007, 190-191). One example was found in late Saite levels within the sanctuary of Aphrodite (context \u03a68; Boston RES.88.45), the others do not have secure contextual information. ", " An example of this type, in limestone with alternating lion's paw feet and spoolhandles (3 each), has been found in a Lydian child's grave at the village of Tekelio\u011flu K\u00f6y\u00fc near Manisa, with a suggested date in the last quarter of the 6th century BC: Mitten, D.G. and Y\u00fc\u011fr\u00fcm, G., \u201cExcavations at Ahlatl\u0131 Tepecik on the Gygean Lake, 1968\u201d, T\u00fcrk arkeoloji dergisi, 17,1.1968, 17.1, 125\u2013131, esp. 127 , 131 figs 9-10.
