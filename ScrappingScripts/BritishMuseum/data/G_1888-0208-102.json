{"artifact_name": "neck-amphora", "Object Type": ["neck-amphora"], "Museum number": ["1888,0208.102"], "Description": [" Nine joined fragments of Attic black-figure painted pottery neck-amphora. Designs black on red ground, with purple accessories and incised lines. Above, the hunt of the Calydonian boar (?): Part of the boar is visible moving to left; his hide is incised; a warrior (Ankaios? on the analogy of the Francois vase) lies prostrate beneath to right. His face is purple, the rest of the figure black; he wears a helmet and short chiton, and holds a spear in left hand; between his body and the hind-legs of the boar are purple drops of blood. Behind the boar is visible part of a dog which has leapt on him, also the feet of two heroes (Kastor? and Polydeukes?). On a lower band, probably representing the funeral games of some legendary person (Pelias?), are: On the left two beardless athletes in short purple chitons boxing over a tripod, next to the left a brabeus, bearded, with fillet and purple himation, wand in right hand; next, a group of two wrestlers, beardless with short purple chitons; the one on the left has a fillet. Beyond them two tripods, and on the extreme right, part of another figure in a purple himation; the tripods are evidently the prizes for the athletic contests. Purple on face and neck of man lying below boar and for blood above his belly; on bodies of boxers and wrestler, cloaks of referees, basins of tripods on right. White on underskirt of second referee, on chiton of man below boar.

Cook dates the vase to 570-560BC while Venit (1982) dates it to 580-570 BC.

Cf. E. N. Gardiner, Athletics of the Ancient World, fig. 184 (detail of the boxers: wrongly said to be from Naucratis). For the athletics scene, cf. the Amphiaraos vase (Berlin No. 1655, Mon. dell\u2019 Inst. x. 4-5), especially the wrestlers, and the tripods as prizes. ", " The shape of the vase must be that of a neck-amphora, as suggested by Venit, rather than a dinos as suggest by Cook, judging from the likely position of the handle, the decorative scheme and the unglazed interior.
