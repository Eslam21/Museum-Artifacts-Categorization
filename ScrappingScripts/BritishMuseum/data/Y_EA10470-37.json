{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10470,37"], "Description": [" 'Book of the Dead' of Ani (frame 37): Spell 185 continued. This is the last frame of the funerary papyrus belonging to the Royal Scribe and Granary Overseer, Ani. It is composed entirely of vignettes, which illustrate Chapters 185 and 186 of the 'Book of the Dead'. On the left, in a shrine topped by a falcon head and a frieze of cobras, stands the falcon-headed mummiform funerary god Sokar-Osiris holding a crook, flail and animal-headed 'was' sceptre. The hippopotamus goddess Opet stands to the right; behind two altars decorated with lotuses and heaped with loaves of bread, a haunch of meat, a bull's head, onions, grapes, gourds and cos lettuces. In a form identical with the better-known hippopotamus goddess, Taweret, she wears horns, a sun disc and rests on a protective 'sa'-sign. Opet offers life and a flaming taper for warmth to the deceased. The text above her is in praise of Hathor, patroness of the west, who is represented as a cow emerging from the western mountain at Thebes into the clumps of papyrus that fringe the Nile Valley. She wears around her neck the pendulum shaped counterpoise and loosely strung bead rows of a 'menyet' collar. The 'menyet' collar provides source of sound when shaken and particularly associated with the goddess' worship. Between her horns are a sun-disc and tall plumes. Ani's tomb chapel is depicted on the mountains slopes with a sharply pointed pyramidal mud-brick roof. This is a characteristic feature of contemporary Theban private tombs; it is also capped by a stone pyramidion, clearly defined by its dark colour. Just below it is depicted a round-topped stela that would have been inscribed with a prayer to the sun god.

This might be interpreted to suggest he died unexpectedly before he had produced a funerary papyrus written in his own hand. In such a situation his grieving family would have purchased one for him and had his name added where gaps had been left for that purpose.
