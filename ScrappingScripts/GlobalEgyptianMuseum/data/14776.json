{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 72233", "Dating": "OLD KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF GIZA (INCLUDING MEMPHIS)", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "33 cm", "Name": "Statue of a Servant Straining Mash", "Description": "Beer was manufactured by making dough of barley, which was first left to ferment, then partly baked in the oven, after which it was soaked in water. The moistened bread would then be kneaded by hand (or foot) through a strainer into a vat with a spout. The mash was finally poured into jars and stored for fermentation. The same mash was still used in Egypt and Sudan in recent times, by humble people as a beverage.This is a \"servant statue\" from the household of a high official in the Old Kingdom. The servant has a round face and is wearing a short curled wig. He looks straight ahead and is not leaning a little to see what he is doing. His body is strong and his head is attached to his body with just a short space for the neck. The strainer into which he is putting the kneaded dough is carved to show that it was a basket. The big vat in which he collects the mash has a spout at the front and stands in a hole in the small base, which is made to look like basketry, on the stone base of the whole piece."}
