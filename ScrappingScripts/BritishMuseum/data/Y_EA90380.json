Egyptologists have often considered them to be late, decadent and unworthy of Egyptian culture, but that is a false value judgement: they have been found in native Egyptian contexts on numerous sites. Parkinson dates them from around the 4th century BC or later (2013, 87). The figure was probably something worn as a amulet. Its purpose could have been to ensure potency, or perhaps to ward off evil: ithyphallic gods are often protective. The difficulties of interpretation have been hampered by modern reluctance to display and publish such material. The provenance is often unrecorded, although examples have been discovered in the cultic areas of the necropolis at Saqqara, where they were placed as votive offerings. Many have apparently humorous aspects, with enormous phalli wrapped around their necks and the like. Bibliography: C. Johns, 1997. 'Erotica', British Museum Pocket Treasury, p. 20-21. R.
