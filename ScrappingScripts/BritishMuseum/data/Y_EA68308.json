{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68308"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Bes standing on a rough plinth. He is naked, with his hands on his thighs, and wears a feathered headdress; an animal-head pendant hangs on his breast; the right lower arm is lost. A large piece has been broken away from the figure's left side. The underside of the plinth is very rough and has a low boss, which suggests that the figure was once affixed to some object. One-piece mould; object flattish and rough at the back. Red Nile silt with a thick grey core, containing some mica and white inclusions, probably sand. Overall white dressing, including the underside of the plinth. Most of the figure is painted pink, with traces of green paint on the feathers of the crown. There are areas of a dark pitch-like substance over much of the body and face. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 30th Dynasty (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
