{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3175", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "RIFA", "Category": "HOUSE (MODEL)", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Height": "20 cm", "Depth": "32 cm", "Name": "Soul house", "Description": "This 'soul house' belongs to a type of pottery objects which were found in simple tombs at Rifa and which had the same function as an offering table. The model shows a rectangular house with a flat roof supported by four columns. In front of the house, on the right, are offerings in relief: a bull's head, an animal thigh, and some loaves. The holes around the central basin were intended to contain plant stalks. It is possible that these 'soul houses' were miniature substitutes for the large rock tombs of the high officials."}
