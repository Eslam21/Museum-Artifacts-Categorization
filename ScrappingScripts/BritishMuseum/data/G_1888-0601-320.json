{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.32"], "Description": [" Dark grey limestone figure of a youth. Draped youth sitting on a high-backed throne with arm-rests just about indicated and a footstool. His face is worn; his cheekbones are broad and portrusive, the chin pronounced. He is wearing a Cypriot conical cap with lappets and a button-like edge. Underneath the hair is falling in a broad mass with a pouch-like edge down to the shoulders. He is wearing a long wide chiton and an over-garment covering both shoulders and crossing from the left shoulder to the right knee, the under-garment reaching down to the bare feet. The right hand, wrapped in the cloak, is clenched in front of the breast, the left is resting on the arm-rest with the fingers hanging loosely. His body is slender with broad shoulders; the arms are very long with slender forearms and small hands; apart from the head the figure is worked rather flat with little depth. The left top of the throne is missing; the sides and back are flat, neither carefully smoothed nor straightened.
