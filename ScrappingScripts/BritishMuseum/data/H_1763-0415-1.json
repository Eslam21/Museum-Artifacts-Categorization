The subject was popularised through Shakespeare\u2019s Anthony and Cleopatra, Act V, Scene ii, but the actual image is after a painting by Gaspar Netscher, engraved by Jean Georges Wille in 1754. The same image was painted in enamels on an English snuff-box, c. 1755-65, sold at Sotheby's 1 February 1965, lot 343 (information provided by Jennifer Montagu, 2001). The other vase depicts The Death of Harmonia, based on an engraving by Charles Nicholas Cochin, published in Paris, in 1751, after the original painting by Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon in the same year as the print. The anonymous donor may have commissioned the vases, perhaps even supplying the factory with the two prints. They were the first modern ceramics acquired by the Museum. The following note appeared in the minutes of the Trustees Committee meetings (a sub-group which handled everyday business), which recorded a gift made on 15 April 1763 from \u2018Mr Empson of two very fine porcellanous jars of the Chelsea Manufactory made in the year 1762 under the direction of Mr Sprimond\u2019.

Pair with 1763,0415.2 ", " Walker & Higgs 2001 Comment refers to both 1763,0415.1 & 2 The vases are painted over the glaze in enamel colours against a dark blue ground. One (No. 1) shows the Death of Cleopatra after a painting by Gaspar Netscher (1639-84) engraved by J.G. Wille (1715-1808). The scene on the other vase is based on the Death of Harmonia after Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre (1713-89). Pierre's painting was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1751. Harmony is the child of Mars (a patron of Mark Antony) and Venus (Cleopatra's patron goddess), and so stands for Cleopatra, and is shown here in the act of killing herself. The other vase (No.2) depicts the discovery of the dead Cleopatra by Octavian and Dolabella. The dead woman at her feet is her maid Iras. The scene is based on Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, Act V, scene ii. It is depicted in an oil-on-paper painting by John Parker painted in Rome around 1748-9 (P&D 1949,1008.1). On the reverse of these expensively decorated and lavishly gilded vases, no doubt destined for an aristocratic client, are panels of exotic birds. Bird-painting was extremely popular on all kinds of porcelain. Figure scenes of dramatic events, such as the death of Cleopatra, are exceptional. In 1759 David Garrick presented an adapted version of Shakespeare's play at Drury Lane, but it was not a success. Performances were given throughout the eighteenth century of John Dryden's All for Love (1678), and this may have been how the English public absorbed the story of Cleopatra. That it was popular is not in doubt, as there are various medallions and figures of the Egyptian queen made by Josiah Wedgwood from the early 1770s. Around 1785-90 an enamelled pottery figure of Cleopatra reclining was made by James Neale and Co. of Hanley, Staffordshire. It is based on an ancient marble in the Vatican collection, which was much admired and copied in many different media almost from the time it was first recorded in the early sixteenth century (P&D 1943,1113.53). Various lead-glazed pottery versions of the figure were made in the late eighteenth century by other Staffordshire firms, in particular by Enoch Wood, who produced a companion figure of Mark Antony (See Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, inv no. C.908-1928 and C.909.1928). By the end of the eighteenth century there was a market in Britain for relatively inexpensive ceramic representations of Cleopatra, and it is probable that some of these were exported to North America.
