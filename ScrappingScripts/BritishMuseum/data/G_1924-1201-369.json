Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology N85 also shows the same chequer pattern. The interior decoration is different from 1924,1201.369 and therefore they are unlikely to be from the same vessel. Lemos suggests that the chequer pattern on N85 might represent an altar. Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.89.1894 shows a bird, possibly a partridge, climbing a black and reserved chequered structure, which Lemos also interprets as an altar. The interior decoration on this sherd is also different from 1924,1201.369 and therefore is unlikely to have come from the same vessel."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.0755) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.369"]}
