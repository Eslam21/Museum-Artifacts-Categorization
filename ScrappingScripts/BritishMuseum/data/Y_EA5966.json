The sepals of the lotus are inlaid with green paste. The lowest sections of buds and flower are painted red. The interior of the spoon has two compartments formed from the hollowed out lotus flower and mandrake.

Symbolically, it had strong connotations of new life because the flower reopens each day, and it was the lotus which was believed to have appeared first on the waters of primordial chaos with the creator god at its heart. The mandrake always had erotic undertones. Bibliography: 'Un Arte per la Belleza' (Padua, 1984), p. 50 [63] = 'Un Arte per la Belleza' (Lugano, 1984), p. 50 [112].
