{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA54343"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Astsy(?): this round-topped stela consists of three registers and sits on two pedestals with a 'ba'-bird on top of it. A winged sun-disk with two uraei and two jackals holding sceptres appear in the upper register. In the middle register a male figure stands on the right with arms raised in worship before an altar on which rests an offering cooled by a lotus-bud. Above him his name is given as Astsy(?) with the title 'nb pr'. On the other side of the altar stand Ra-Horakhty, Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, and Anubis. The lower register consists of three lines of text with a prayer to Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, and Anubis. The stela is cracked twice down its height where the three planks which compose it adjoin. The surface is worn in places. There is a patch in the back to fill a hole in one of the planks. The background of the stela is yellow. There is a red border along three sides of the stela beside which is a thin blue border. Further in is a multi-coloured border consisting of blue, green, blue, and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes. A similar border separates each register. The disk at the top is red. The wings have a red upper edge and are in three sections: blue, yellow with red stripes, and blue with white tips. The uraei are blue with light green crowns and enclose an area of white with red dotted rays. The jackals are black with red sashes and blue sceptres. The text is black here and in the next register where it is written between black lines, apart from the last column which is set off by green lines. The deceased has a red body, yellow kilt with blue lines and a red fringe, black belt, blue cap, green cone, and black flower. The altar is blue with a green offering and blue lotus.
