It ought to be noted that the glaze finds parallels with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) type 5 and Type 9 cups. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.150) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.890"]}
