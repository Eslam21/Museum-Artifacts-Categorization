", " Stored with 1899 Naukratis material in 1983, raising some doubt about its Naukratis provenance. The fabric is not certainly from the Nile Delta. A number of life and model sized theatre masks are known from Naukratis. Large examples include tragedy masks (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.301.1899; Leonard 2001, 164, no.1 pl. 3.1, MC#37, 165, no.2, pl. 3.2.

A Dionysus mask (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.308.1899) and Bes mask (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA713) are also known. Examples from known archaeological contexts at Naukratis appear to be Ptolemaic, mainly 3rd and 2nd century BC, in date (Bailey 2008, no.3567; Petrie et al. 1886: 45; Leonard 2001, Pl. 3.2). However, a similar figure was also dated to the 3rd century AD (Fischer 1994: no. 351). Fischer, J. 1994. \u2018Griechisch-r\u00f6mische Terrakotten aus \u00c4gypten.
