", " Lemos incorrectly identifies the sherd as belonging to a Chian black-figure Komast chalice and places it in Group E of the black-figure Komast chalices. The chalices in this group do not contain any filling ornament, details of the komasts are rendered very simply and inner decoration is basic. The iconography on this sherd is different from typical komast chalices and there is no evidence of black-figure incision. Schaus lists the sherd as probably belonging to the Altenburg Painter. According to Cook's classification system, the sherd belongs in the Cambridge Group (named after Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.52.1899, GR.302.1899 and GR.303.1899); the human figures are rudimentary but resemble those from the Altenburg Group.
