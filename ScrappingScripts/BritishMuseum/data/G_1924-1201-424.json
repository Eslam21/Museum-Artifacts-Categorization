Lemos describes the sherd as coming from a light-walled and big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice kraters. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
