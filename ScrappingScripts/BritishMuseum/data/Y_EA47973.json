{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA47973"], "Description": [" Schist figure of a man wearing a mask of Bes: damage has occurred to the nose, right cheek, the left pectoral muscle and the right arm. Both hands have broken away, and the crown has been repaired. The figure has been left unfinished at the back and the sides, where a back pillar was intended, but only partly worked on the proper right side of the figure. This unusual representation of what appears to be Bes is unlikely to be the god, because of the human form of the body: Bes is usually shown with a flabby, animal-like physique, with stumpy legs, and a hugely distended head. Here the figure is designed according to the ideal Egyptian canon of human form, with square shoulders, arms held out to the sides, a narrow waist, with a well-defined navel, and one leg placed in front of the other, but both feet flat on the ground. The figure wears a kilt, not seen in representations of Bes. It seems probable, therefore, that the subject is human, perhaps a priest of Bes, wearing a mask and crown, for ceremonial activities.
