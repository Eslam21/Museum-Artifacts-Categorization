{"artifact_name": "figure; model group", "Object Type": [" figure ", " model group "], "Museum number": ["EA47637"], "Description": [" Lower part of a wooden seated figure: the figure was seated with his hands on his thighs, but everything above the waist has been lost. The execution of the work is rather rough; the thumb of the left hand is indicated, but the fingers are not; the right hand has been damaged. The feet end bluntly. At the level of the knees a hole has been bored through the figure from front to back, presumably to take a peg to secure the seated figure on a 'block' throne. The legs, feet, painted white to indicate a kilt.

It is associated with the hull of a model boat (1907,1015.11). The figure is similar to the seated figure on a model boat from the same excavations, now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva, no. 4769 'bis'. The top of the head is flat and without wig.
