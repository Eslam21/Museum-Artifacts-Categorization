{"artifact_name": "rattle; figure; askos", "Object Type": [" rattle ", " figure ", " askos "], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta askos (flask), or rattle, in the form of pig or boar. The vessel has a cylindrical neck with a flaring mouth rising from the back of the pig; a spout, broken at its tip, is placed at the animal\u2019s nose. The body was thrown on the wheel and then manipulated into shape, with several applied elements: the neck of the flask, the feet, the ridged mane, the ears. The tail may have been applied or modelled from the thrown pot (its tip is broken), and the eyes were formed by pressing a hollow rod into the soft clay. Covered, except the underbelly, with a creamy white slip then painted with black lines. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant mica and sand inclusions.
