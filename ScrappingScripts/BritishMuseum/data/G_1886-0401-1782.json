{"artifact_name": "stove", "Object Type": ["stove"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1782"], "Description": [" Terracotta cooking stove fragment. A pot-support: a theatre mask of Papposilenos or satyr with wild hair and beard, the support itself being a plain extension, within a plain rectangular panel. The back is plain; part of the fire-bowl, with an everted hooked rim, survives. The support and panel were made in a onepiece mould with subsequent hand-working on the hair. As with several of these objects, the pot support itself is strengthened with an application of clay below it, smeared over the adjacent inner wall of the fire-bowl. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a red and grey core. There are signs of burning on the support and the decorated panel.
