Imhotep was not only a sculptor and architect, but also a physician who was venerated in the New Kingdom and later periods as the god of healing. He was identified with the Greek god of Medicine Asclepius and was considered to be the mediator between people and gods. This statue was dedicated to the god by a pious worshipper who might have been an artist, a physician or a scribe. He would thus obtain cleverness, wisdom or precision in his work from Imhotep, who is depicted here sitting on a chair as a young man reading from the rolled papyrus on his lap and facing straight forward. His hair is short and he has no divine beard. The eyes are painted white with black pupils"}
