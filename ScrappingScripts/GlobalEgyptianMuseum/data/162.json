{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.0681", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "TELL EL-RUB` ?", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED; ENGRAVED; FAYENCE; ENGRAVED", "Height": "10.8 cm", "Name": "Shabti of Nesbaankhou (?)", "Description": "This funerary statuette in greenish faience probably dates from the end of the Late Period. Apart from the classical characteristics like the tripartite wig, the false beard, the work tools, the small sack of grain, the dorsal pillar and the socle, the shabti is distinguished by an inscription in the form of a T. The hieroglyphic text, which only contains the titles and the name of the owner and his mother, is divided on a horizontal line followed by a vertical column. The reading of the name is not certain: Nesbaankhou and Nefret-?. The titles of the owner (\"priest-imy-khenet\" and \"that which separates the two gods\") show that the person was part of the clergy of Mendes."}
