XVIII, no. 34). The goose, a sacred animal for Amun-Ra, or the duck is a regular theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88). This scarab belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 102, 106-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B24-31). Scholars tend to translate such a composition by \"son of Ra\" or see a cryptographic reading of the god name Amun (Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). With the use of debased hieroglyphs for this scarab, however, it seems clear that the meaning of such an inscription was not understood. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
