", " Scorpion is a relatively common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory' in Naukratis (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). They were found at Naukratis itself (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 8-10) and in many sites across the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 100, type XXVIIIA, subtype A196-203). Let's note that the motif is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
