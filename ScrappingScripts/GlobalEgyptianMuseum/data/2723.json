{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "507.5", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "3 cm", "Name": "Amulet of Ram-headed god", "Description": "Blue-glazed faience figure of a ram-headed deity, left foot forward, arms to side, with hole behind the waist for attaching to mummy-wrappings. The base of the figure is lost. Deities depicted with ram-head include Amun, the Soul of Mendes (a city in the central Delta), and Khnum, as well as the sun-god Re in the night sky, in certain compositions. The ram head appears in the hieroglyphic script as the sign for 'shefyt' meaning 'dignity', the underlying idea presumably being the procreative power of the animal."}
