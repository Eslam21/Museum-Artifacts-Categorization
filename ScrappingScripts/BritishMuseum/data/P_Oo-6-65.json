Claude is known to have painted just one nocturnal painting, which is now lost but recorded in the BM's Liber Veritatis page 59 (for which see BM, 1957,1214.65; Roethlisberger 1968, No. 127). Roethlisberger does not think the two works are related, and he dated the painting to the late 1630s and the present drawing to the early 1640s. However, it must be noted that the rays that emanate from the \u2018moon\u2019 suggests it may instead have meant to be a day scene that was covered extensively with wash. Roethlisberger observes that Claude\u2019s use of bold penwork recurs in two other drawings; one in the British Museum (Oo,6.108; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 482), and one in the Teyler Museum in Haarlem (S.15; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 474), but it must be noted that in this present sheet the penwork is at its most rapid and impressionistic. By extension, it is worth bringing the attribution of this drawing into question. In this respect, it is worth noing that the theme and composition are reminiscent of works of Adam Elsheimer (1578-1610), a German artist working in Rome in the early 17th century. The latter's works influenced many artists apart from Claude, including Rembrandt and Peter Paul Rubens. Keith Andrews proposed that Claude (if indeed this drawing is by Claude) was directly inspired by the 'Flight in Egypt' painting, dated 1609, now in Munich. But it is perhaps more likely that the inspiration was the engraving of 1613 made after Elsheimer's painting by Hendrick van Goudt (1583\u20131648) because the composition is in the same direction as the reversed engraving (Hollstein 3; BM impressions F,3.92 and S.4960).
