The publication of his 'Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians' followed in 1836, in which some of the objects were engraved and many described. They were purchased by A W Franks and given to the BM in June 1883. The slip for the first item gives the initials RSP as the source of the collection. This must stand for Reginald Stuart Poole, Lane's nephew. Reginald Stuart Poole\u2019s mother was Lane\u2019s sister, and from 1842-9 he lived with his mother and her brother in Cairo, where E W Lane took charge of his education. Poole worked throughout his career in the BM. He was originally in Dept. of Antiquities, then in 1861 assigned to Coins & Medals on the creation of the separate department, and was its Keeper 1870-93. The owner of the works was Lane's widow, who was Greek by birth.
