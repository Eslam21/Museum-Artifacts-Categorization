{"artifact_name": "tool/implement", "Object Type": ["tool/implement"], "Museum number": ["EA86289"], "Description": [" Unidentified iron tool, very corroded, in an elongated conical shape. Consisting of two parts, the thinner end is square in section and compact (handle?), the pointed end is slightly bend. The wider end is circular in section and hollow. Inside about 3 mm from the rim an iron peg, 1.14 cm long. Almost perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the peg a very small hole in the wall of the hollow part, approximately 0.07 cm in diameter. Therefore another part of the object would have been attached here.
