Her figure is gracefully modeled and the arms, which were carved separately and then attached to the shoulders, are now missing. Her wide eyes and eyebrows are painted black with a long cosmetic eyeline. The girl has very short black hair with a long braid ending in a heavy ball. These balls were usually shown hanging from the braids of child dancers. The girls would turn their heads rapidly while dancing and the ball hanging from the head would twirl around."}
