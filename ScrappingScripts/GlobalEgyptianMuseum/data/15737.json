{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 28882", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "BURNED; DRAWING", "Height": "9 cm", "Name": "Ostracon with Men's Figures", "Description": "This fragmentary ostracon shows scenes of daily life. The main subject, which takes up the major part of the surface of the ostracon, shows how a boat is loaded. In the upper left hand corner, two men are kneeling on a thin baseline. They are lifting up their right hands as if working with chisels above them, a figure is drawn with a broad brush. The artist has not paid much attention to the details of the men's figures. It appears that the intention of the artist was to make a quick sketch of the scene before executing it directly on the walls of a tomb."}
