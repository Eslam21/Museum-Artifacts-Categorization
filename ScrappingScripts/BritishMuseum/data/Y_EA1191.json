{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1191"], "Description": [" Limestone false-door of Meri: the stela is of the standard late Old Kingdom pattern with 'cavetto'-cornice and torus-moulding. The top lintel-panel carries a short Hotep-di-nesu text and the remaining panels on the jambs and subsidiary lintels bear Meri's titles and dignities. There are standing figures of Meri at the bottom of each vertical line of text. The rectangular panel above the doorway carries a representation of Meri seated behind an offering-table; he is shown smelling ointment or perfume in a jar. The central panel of the doorway bears a double 'wedjat'-eye. All the texts and figures are in fair sunk relief. There has been weathering of the surface in some places, but the stone is now quite firm. Repaired from four pieces.
