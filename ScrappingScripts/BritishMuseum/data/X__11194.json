", " The motif depicted on the base appears on some scarabs produced at Naukratis (on the various productions of the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 98-99, type XXVIII A, subtype A214-219). Petrie illustrated some examples from Naukratis displaying this motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 123-125).
