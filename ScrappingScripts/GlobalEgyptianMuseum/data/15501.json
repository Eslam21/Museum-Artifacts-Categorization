Those signs are symbols that are associated with Osiris and Isis. The center is occupied by a thick cartouche bearing the name of King Ahmose. Two small sphinxes symbolizing the king flank the cartouche. The small inlaid bar, which protrudes on the opposite side, was worn on the inside of the arm, probably to prevent the armlet from turning."}
