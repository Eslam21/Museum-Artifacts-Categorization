", " Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Scaraboids in the shape of a Black African head are a standard production at Naukratis. This specimen is a plainer version of a Black African head compared with those listed by Petrie (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 8-11), where hair is indicated by lines, cross hatching or braiding.
