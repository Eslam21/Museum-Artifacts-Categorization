{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1988"], "Description": [" One half of a limestone stela (the other half is EA 1983), with incised inscriptions on both sides. One side (here called A) bears the lower ten lines of a long text in Coptic (EA 1983 bears the eight preceding lines). The other side (here called B) bears a shorter Greek text of four lines above a cross flanked by two smaller crosses. The two texts are evidently of a different date; one is upside down in relation to the other. One of the narrow sides bears remains of decorative reliefwork, which shows that the slab was extracted from a larger architectural element. If either inscription (side A or B) is viewed the right way up, the narrow decorated side is to its right.
