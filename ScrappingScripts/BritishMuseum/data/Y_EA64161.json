{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["EA64161"], "Description": [" Fragment of translucent amber-brown bowl, imitating agate: on the exterior of the body are ribs or segments in high relief. The rim is vertical with a ground edge. Clear traces of wheel-turning are visible on the interior of the bowl. The characteristic veining of agate was obtained by the use of groups of opaque white glass bands. Around certain groups of bands are yellow areas which greatly enhance the simulation of agate. This yellow is due to a thin layer of the body colour covering a white band. The bowl was moulded and was given a high polish.

They appear to have been impressed into the bowl while it was in a semi-molten state, but there are objections to this procedure unless it was possible to impress all these bands from the inner surface, a point which remains uncertain."], "Bibliographic references": ["Cooney 1976 / Glass (390)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Percy Edward Newberry"], "Acquisition date": ["1939"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA64161"], "Registration number": ["1939,0322.39"]}
