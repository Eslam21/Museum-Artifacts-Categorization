Although Lemos does not discuss this sherd, she does discuss two other sherds from the same vase, describing British Museum 1888,0601.459 as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dating it later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration (Lemos 1991, 72-3). The second (non-joining) sherd is British Museum 1888,0601.460.e, which she describes as part of the Group of the Aphrodite Bowl, rather than as by the painter of the bowl, because the sherd displays a greater amount of variety in the filling ornaments, albeit similar to those on the Aphrodite Bowl (Lemos 1991, 74-5).. However, the filling ornament on this dinos is not as expertly and evenly executed as that on the Aphrodite Bowl. The interior is similar on both sherds and it ought to be noted that this dinos, as well as other Wild Goat Style dinoi, lacks interior decoration."], "Bibliographic references": [" Williams 2006a / The Chian Pottery from Naukratis (p. 132 note 29) ", " Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
