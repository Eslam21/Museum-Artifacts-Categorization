{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.5663", "Dating": "NAQADA (not before); NAQADA ?; EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "EL-HARAGA", "Category": "KNIFE", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN", "Width": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Flint fishtail knife", "Description": "The ancient Egyptian flint knappers were experts in their field. This extremely beautiful, thin, bifacially flaked fishtail knife is further evidence of their exceptional craftsmanship.  The point has been notched to a V-shape and provided with extremely fine dentitions. Such elaborately worked knives with the pointed part (the shaft tang) set into a wood or bone handle are usually found in tombs dating to the Naqada II Period. They perhaps had a ritual purpose. It has been suggested that they were used to cut the umbilical cord or at circumcision. Perhaps this fishtail knife is a precursor of the forked magical instrument \"pesesh-kef\" used in the so-called opening of the mouth ritual in later times."}
