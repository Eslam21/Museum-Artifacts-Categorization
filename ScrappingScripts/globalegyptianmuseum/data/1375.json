{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7703", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP II/AMENOPHIS II/AAKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "ELKAB/NEKHEB", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "79 cm", "Width": "53 cm", "Depth": "28 cm", "Name": "Bust of king Amenhotep II", "Description": "This upper part of a royal statue was found by the Belgian archaeological mission at Elkab in 1937, at the entrance to the temple of Nekhbet. In spite of the absence of inscriptions, it is almost certain that this bust in pink granite depicts king Amenhotep II. This statue, merging as it does the stylistic features of the statuary of the reigns of Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis III, expresses a great level of serenity, combined with a certain monumentality. The king wears a rather fine linen nemes headdress, decorated with an uraeus."}
