Kitchen boats probably accompanied the owner's main boat to provide him and his companions with food and drink. On the deck, near the mast, there is a large jar with a round stopper, perhaps full of beer, and a brazier, a pan that holds burning coals for cooking. Jars of beer and wine stand in a rack, joints of meat hang on ropes strung between two posts to dry, and two baskets, probably filled with bread, are stored inside the cabin. The cabin is decorated with bull hide shields on each side. The 14 members of the crew are painted dark red and have shaven heads."}
