{"artifact_name": "tile", "Object Type": ["tile"], "Museum number": ["EA38024"], "Description": [" A rectangular glazed composition tile: with a convex face and rounded edges. On the back is a projection to aid the secure fixing of the tile in plaster. This projection is pierced so that the tile could additionally be held by a copper wire, which passed through each tile in turn. The glaze, probably green originally, has completely decayed to a dull white, and one corner of the tile is missing. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 2nd Dynasty (?)
