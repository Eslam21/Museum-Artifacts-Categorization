", " Falcon, sometimes with a flail or wearing a crown like here, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A140-148, see especially A144b for this piece). The hieroglyphic signs on its underside does not seem to make sense. The hieroglyphs could be used here for their magical value as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). However, the cryptic reading of the name of Amun is another possible interpretation (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
