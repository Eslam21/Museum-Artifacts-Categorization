", " Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). According to complete examples, Bastet holds a sistrum in her right hand, raising her arm in front of her. See BM EA25565 as a better preserved example from Bubastis ('Egyptian Treasures' [exhibition catalogue] (Shanghai, 1999), 90-91 No 21). This figure belongs to the type 121 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 678-684, Pl. 32, Typ 121, see esp. 897, Nr. 1456 for this specimen). It is attested since the Third Intermediate Period and grows popular during the Late and Ptolemaic periods. Many sites of the Delta provided such figures, particularly in the Memphite region and Bubastis, but also in Herakleion, Sais and Tanis.
