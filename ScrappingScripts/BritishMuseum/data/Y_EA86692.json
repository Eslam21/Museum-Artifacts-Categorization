{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86692"], "Description": [" Fragment of a comparatively small clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. Visible are two small rows of basketry coil impression at the rear. In one of them an impression of a small square (1.0x0.8 cm) in which the lines are perpendicular to the basketry fibres, as EA86675. Maybe this is a repair at the basket. At the side impressions of slightly bent curve of other plant fibres. The rear of the sealing was not cleaned before the object was hardened and still shows remains of ash and small charcoal bits. The fine red-brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles and was burnt. The top part shows one impression of a scarab-like seal, surrounded by many finger impressions that also cover the seal impression and partly squashed the motif. There is still the figure of pharaoh in a striding pose, having one arm raised to smite an enemy. Pharaoh is facing to the left, behind him a wAs-sceptre. The figure of the enemy (or animal?) is not recognizable very well.
