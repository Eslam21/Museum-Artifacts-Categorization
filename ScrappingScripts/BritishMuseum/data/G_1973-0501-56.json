{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.56"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta seated figure of Harpokrates enthroned. He is naked and has a large phallus (chipped) reaching to his knees. At his left side his lowered left hand is clenched into a fist; the right arm is raised with the palm out-turned. The throne is fairly featureless, with a cushion and a grooved leg defined. An extension to the throne at the figure\u2019s right indicates that another feature was placed on that side. The back is undecorated, with a circular vent. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Orange-brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica, quartz and white grits. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": ["3rdC BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Naukratis "], "Excavator/field collector": [" Excavated by: Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie (?) ", " Excavated by: Egypt Exploration Fund (?) "], "Findspot": [" Excavated/Findspot: Town (Naukratis), Site 95 (Petrie), the terracotta workshop, at the eastern edge of the town "], "Materials": ["terracotta"], "Technique": ["mould-made"], "Dimensions": [" Height: 8.40 centimetres (max) ", " Length: 4.40 centimetres ", " Width: 4.90 centimetres "], "Curator's comments": ["Enthroned ithyphallic Harpocrates with one hand raised. This type was originally produced during the Late Period as a solid figure (British Museum GR 1973,0501.16 and in stone GR2011,5011.15; Cambridge Fitzwilliam, E.81.1914, Cambridge MCA, NA596) and was subsequently made hollow in the 3rd century BC like other Ptolemaic figures (Bolton Museum 1886.31.23; British Museum GR 1973,0501.56; GR1973,0501.10; GR1973,0501.74). Close parallel from Panopolis (?) (Breccia 1934, no. 173, from at the side of the throne the figure of a child is attached, probably alien, LIMC, 8 (2), pl. 693,162, with child removed, the Priapos head applied to this possibly Panopolite Harpokrates must be alien). Another close parallel was dated late 1st century BC (Skupinska-L\u00f8vset 1978, no. UT 117) and unprovenanced (Van Wijngaarden 1958, no. 16). Similar parallels have been dated late Hellenistic (Fischer 1994, no. 562), from the Fayum (Weber 1914, nos 42 and 43) and unprovenanced (Ewigleben and von Grumbkow 1991, no. 25). However a similar example was dated to the Roman period; (Dunand 1990, no. 221), though the figurines from the workshop at Naukratis fit into the period 3rd to 2nd century BC. GR1973,0501.16 and GR1973,0501.74 are of the same type, fabric and subject as British Museum terracottas GR1965,0930.928 and GR1973,0501.56, Bolton terracotta 1886.31.23 and very similar to British Museum limestone figure GR2011,5011.15. These parallels come from Naukratis, the most likely find spot and production place for these objects, based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% are from Naukratis).
