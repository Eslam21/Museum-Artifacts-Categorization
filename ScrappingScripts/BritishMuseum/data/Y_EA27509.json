Similar arrowheads found at Ashkelon in 7th century BC contexts (Aja 2011, 536, nos 78-82) and this type is replaced with the introduction of Scythian types during Persian rule in the 6th century BC (ibid. 513). It is likely an early form that was abandoned early in Naukratis' history. Aja, A. J. 2011, 'Metal weapons and tools', in L. E. Stager, D. M. Master and J. D.
