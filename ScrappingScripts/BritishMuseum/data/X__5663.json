", " Dome-shaped (or \"cupcake-shaped\") weights are the most common type found in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII, \u201cdomed\u201d type), but also elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 4, fig. 13) and in the Near East (Birney and Levine 2011, 474). Those made out of basalt, like this specimen, are particularly numerous in Egypt and this is also the case in Naukratis. They start to be popular with the Late Period, though they do appear with the Ramesside Period (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 26). Such type is especially associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples (Cour-Marty 1990, 20, 25, fig. 22-24). However a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). This specimen corresponds to 2 kedets. Birney, K.J. and Levine, E. 2011, \u2018Balance Weights\u2019, in L.E. Stager, J.D. Schloen and D.M. Master, Ashkelon 3: The Seventh Century B.C.
