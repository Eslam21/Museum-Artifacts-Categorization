{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA30478"], "Description": [" Cylindrical pendant: amulet made of gold and amethyst with fragments of filling from the same. Three cylindrical amethyst beads alternate with two similar beads of gold foil over a core. At each end there is a gold cap made from a piece of sheet gold folded to form a cone and soldered down one end; a sheet gold disc was then added at the top. On top of the upper cap, to one side, a suspension tube for wire or thread was soldered; nine grooves have been chased on it to imitate beads. Both ends of the tube are worn away. The gold beads of the shaft are of gold foil over a core, possibly quartz. Both are in poor condition, the gold being jagged at the edges. Two of the amethyst beads are bored horizontally as well as vertically but the horizontal boring does not pierce the central vertical boring; its purpose may have been to hold a pin to which a piece of gold was attached. The amethyst beads are much cracked. A copper pin runs down the centre of the shaft.
