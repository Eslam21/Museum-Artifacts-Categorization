", " Lemos describes the sherd as belonging to the Group with the Filling Ornament. The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds of the Grand Style. The presence of filling ornament also suggests that the vases were mostly likely the earliest in that style. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand.
