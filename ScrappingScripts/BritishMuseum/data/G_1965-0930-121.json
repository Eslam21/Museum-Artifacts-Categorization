The exterior slip, the inscription and the thinness of the sherd indicate that it most likely belonged to a chalice or a kantharos. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice.
