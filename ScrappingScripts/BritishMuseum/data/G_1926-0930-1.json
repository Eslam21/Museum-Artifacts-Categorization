{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.1"], "Description": [" Head of terracotta female figure. A head of a woman, broken from a very large figure. The hair is in an emphatic melon style, but does not have the bun normally found with such a coiffure. The ears are hidden by the hair. A groove crosses the long neck. Hollow; apparently from a two-piece mould, with heavy manipulation of the hair over the join. Chamfering at the bottom of the neck shows that it was not made with the body, but plugged into it. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with some white grits and a thin red and thick grey core; the face and front of the neck are slightly burnished.
