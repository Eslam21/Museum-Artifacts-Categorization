{"artifact_name": "signet-ring", "Object Type": ["signet-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA68868"], "Description": [" Gold signet-ring of Sheshonq: this massive gold ring is of a shape common for such rings in the Late Period, a shape which more or less totally replaced the earlier stirrup-shaped type. The lozenge shaped bezel is so thick that the back had to be cut away to accommodate the finger of the wearer; the shank and the bezel were made in separate molds and joined together. It is incised with the name of Sheshonq and his title \"Chief Steward of the divine adoratrice.\" "], "Cultures/periods": ["26th Dynasty"], "Production date": ["575BC (circa)"], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Thebes (historic - Upper Egypt) (?)

Besides this functional aspect, the ring was no doubt as much (if not more) worn as a mark of Sheshonq's status and wealth. The name Sheshonq is of Libyan origin, belonging to several kings of the Libyan Period, but it became popular among Egyptians from that time onwards. Two men named Sheshonq are known as stewards of these women, and the limited information on this ring makes it difficult to know to which to ascribe it. The better-known Sheshonq, perhaps the more plausible candidate for the owner, who had an impressive tomb in the Assasif at Thebes, worked under the divine adoratrice Ankhnesneferibre, daughter of Psamtek II, in the first half of the 6th century BC. The other Sheshonq lived somewhat later, perhaps also in the lifetime of Ankhnesneferibre, but in the second half of the same century.
