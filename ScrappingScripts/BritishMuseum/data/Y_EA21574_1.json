{"artifact_name": "bed", "Object Type": ["bed"], "Museum number": ["EA21574"], "Description": [" Wooden bed: the footboard between the uprights is a modern restoration. The legs of the bed are made from a fine, dark hardwood and are beautifully carved into a bovine form, and the hooves, like the crossrail, are embellished with silver. The legs are overlaid with coiled cobras of heavy gold sheet metal that follows the contours of the intricate design carved into the hardwood and is attached by gold and silver nails. Ebony cobras that snake along the uprights of the footboard are inlaid with tiny silver rings punched into the wood.

These fragments were reputed to be the remains of the royal throne of Hatshepsut when they were presented to the British Museum in 1887. The have now been correctly reassembled as a couch or bed. One of the New Kingdom refinements in furniture design was an almost universal change in the type of animal-shaped legs, with the more elaborate feline legs replacing bulls' legs. Thus it is noteworthy that this bed retains the bovine form that was used as a furniture support from Egypt's earliest period. It is possible that this bed is an import or copy of the type of beds (or biers) found in Nubia in the great Kerma tumuli of the Second Intermediate Period (1650-1550 B.C.); the shapes of the beds in those finds and the technique of their construction show many similarities with this example. Regardless of where this bed was constructed, it demonstrates the appreciation of good craftsmanship and elegant decoration that was widespread in the early Eighteenth Dynasty. Bibliography: B.
