{"artifact_name": "shabti", "Object Type": ["shabti"], "Museum number": ["EA35365"], "Description": [" Serpentine shabti of Amenhotep II: the figure represents the pharaoh wrapped like a mummy with only head and hands emerging; there is no indication of sleeve or collar ends. He wears the royal 'nemes' wig cover with two long lappets at the front and a queue at the back. When coloured, the characteristic stripes of the 'nemes' are alternating yellow and blue. The 'nemes' was made from either dyed leather or possibly even gold with lapis lazuli inlays. On the king's forehead is an upreared cobra, symbol of kingship, and on his chin the long royal beard. In his hands the shabti holds two 'ankh' signs, symbolizing life and, in particular, the desired life after death, thus identifying the figure with the king himself. Nevertheless, the carved hieroglyphic text across the front of the body is a standard New Kingdom version of Chapter 6 of the 'Book of the Dead', the so-called \"shabti formula,\" to bring the figure to life in the other world to carry out the agricultural labor required of its dead royal owner. The 'nemes' is chipped.

It reveals the curious dichotomy in the function of the shabti which existed at this period. The royal accoutrements and the 'ankhs' show it is the king himself who is depicted, exactly as was the case with the earliest shabtis, which were held to represent the deceased. Yet the presence of the shabti formula shows the figure is to be treated at the very same time as a servant of the deceased. Eventually this was to become the sole function of the shabti.
