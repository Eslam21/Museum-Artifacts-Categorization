", " A few amulets in similar material were found in Naukratis, all representing Egyptian gods. They share details in the manufacture and style: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.86.326, 86.184 and 86.188; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.684 and AN1888.173; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2267. It is plausible that they were produced locally. The Hathoric crown was first associated to the goddess Hathor but from the Late Period onwards, it was largely used for Isis (Marsha, Schorsch 2007, 151, note 5). Isis is also a common topic among Naukratis votives and amulets (Masson forthcoming). Marsha H., Schorsch D.
