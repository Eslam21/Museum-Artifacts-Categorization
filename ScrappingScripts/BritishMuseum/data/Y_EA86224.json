The steatite is of a grey colour, the glaze is white to light green with the hieroglyphs and area between the legs in a dark green colour. Concerning the small scale of the scarab, the carving is of a high quality. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line. The head is oval. The clypeus is clearly divided from the head by a line, no details shown though. The plates at each side are shown in a sunken area next to the head. The side of the scarab shows all three legs carved, the scarab is sitting on top of the base plate. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, inside three hieroglyphs facing to the right: un upright uraeus or wAD.t (I12), behind this a seated mAa.t goddess with the feather, both on top of a nb-basket. The longitudinal perforation is fully preserved.
