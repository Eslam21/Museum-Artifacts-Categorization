{"artifact_name": "sealing", "Object Type": ["sealing"], "Museum number": ["EA85656"], "Description": [" Small clay bulla in the shape of a ball, made of dark brown Nile clay that was consolidated after excavation leading to a darker colouration. The surface is very eroded, about the half is chipped off, the remaining part is slightly uneven, roughly formed and finished. On the surface parts of six or 7 shallow seal impressions of an oval scarab-like seal. The motif of the seal shows two gods facing each other, between them a Dd-pillar. The god on the right is depicted in mummy-form and wears a sceptre. The seal-impressions seem to originate all from the same seal.
