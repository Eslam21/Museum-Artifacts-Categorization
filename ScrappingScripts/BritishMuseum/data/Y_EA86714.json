{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86714"], "Description": [" Very small but complete seal-impression with two small coils of basketry on one side and one row of equally small coil of basketry on the other side, showing that this piece originates from the lid of a basket. The sealing is so small that the seal barely fit on it. The fine brown Nile clay has few inclusions of mica and shows blackening due to fire. Some salt crystals are visible as well. The top part shows finger impressions around a scarab-like seal impression. The motif consists of four figures in different orientation. One is a lying lion arranged at the narrow end, with the rear facing towards the centre of the seal. Above it a scorpion with the tail in the same direction as the lion. Left of it what looks like another figure, only traces remain. Above the scorpion another sign that looks like the stem of a palm tree or another plant, oriented 90\u00b0 to the orientation of the lion.
