{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA48061"], "Description": [" Fragmentary sandstone female figure, the lower body and part of the head now missing. The figure wears a long striated wig with a broad section of hair at the back, the full form of the style at the top of the head now lost. A taller portion of the stone on the left side could possibly indicate that she wore a crown or headdress. The facial features are also obscured. Across the surviving portion of the upper body are straps across the chest delineating her dress, which was likely a long tight-fitting style. On the reverse is a portion of a slim back-pillar which meets the ends of the wig. In addition to the loss of much of the figure, there are various small chips to the wig and upper body. The figure is now attached to a modern rectangular base.

Based on the condition of the fragment it is difficult to narrow down a precise date or to determine if the figure was of divine or royal status. General Bibliography: W.M.F.
