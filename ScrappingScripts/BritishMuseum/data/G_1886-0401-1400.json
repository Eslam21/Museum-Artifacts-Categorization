There is a close parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525 BC - 400 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2114). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9). Probably from South Ionia, Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). A parallel from Erythrae, Turkey, dated between c. 540BC to c. 520BC (Bayburtluo\u011flu 1977, 80-1, pls 9, 11 and 16, nos 17, 19 and 27).
