{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6185B", "Dating": "NAQADA II (not before); 1ST DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "NAQADA", "Category": "KNIFE", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "HEWN; UNSPECIFIED STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Width": "6.4 cm", "Name": "Flint knife", "Description": "This diamond shaped knife blade has been made from long fragments, polished at first on two faces, then on the sides to give it a  fine, sharp cutting edge. The tiny teeth are missing at one of the ends, which allows us to deduce the length of the stone tenon on which the handle was attached. The object presents no traces of use. It is probably a ceremonial weapon endowed with social and religious significance."}
