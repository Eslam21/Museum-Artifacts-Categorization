The print is based on Denon's self-portrait after a drawing by Isabey (IFF 271; Chu 153; impression in BM: 1881,0611.20) which was used as the frontispiece to Denon's \"Voyage en Egypte\", 1802. The present impression is pasted into a volume of early English lithographs, described as \"Specimens of Polyautography\", compiled before c.1820. The sheet to which it is attached has a watermark dated 1816, but the print itself carries no date. Man (Felix H Man, \"Lithography in England (1801-1810)\", in C. Zigrosser (ed.), \"Prints\" (1962), p. 117) dated it on stylistic grounds to 1806, taking a view of the technical progress of lithography in England in the years after the earliest English lithographs were made in 1801; the keys to his dating were a certain number of dated prints, notably a set of twelve published in 1803 by Philipp Andr\u00e9, and sets of thirty-six and at least five published in 1806 and 1806/07 by G J Vollweiler. Few lithographs were produced in the next decade before the technique was taken up by Ackermann and Hullmandel in 1818. Man transcribes the printmaker's name as \"Arnold\", but does not identify him; the ink is blotted and the name may be \"Arnald\", i.e., George Arnald, the painter."], "Bibliographic references": ["Man 1962 / Lithography in England 1801-10 (with a catalogue of 165 prints) (12)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": [" Portrait of: Baron Dominique Vivant Denon ", " Illustration to: Baron Dominique Vivant Denon "], "Associated titles": ["Associated Title:", " Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: James Rimell & Son"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Thomas Fisher"], "Acquisition date": ["1874"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1874,0711.951"]}
