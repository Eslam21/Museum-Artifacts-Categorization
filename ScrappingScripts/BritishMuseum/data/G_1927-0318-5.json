"], "Museum number": ["1927,0318.5"], "Description": [" Ivory counter with a portrait of a woman wearing a sakkos. The subject wears a large sakkos, the folds of which are clearly shown. In front of the headdress and above the brow are a mass of small curls. Also of late Ptolemaic appearance is the nose, the full cheek, the thick, slightly downturned lips and the prominent chin. The portrait is not continued below the chin. On the reverse is inscribed the numeral VI and perhaps the Demotic 'tay', meaning 'she of', a conventional start to an Egyptian woman's name.
