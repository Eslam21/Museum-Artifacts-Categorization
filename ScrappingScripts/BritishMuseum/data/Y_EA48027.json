{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA48027"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta standing figure of a female saint or beneficent demon, with a triangular wreath framing her hair. No arms, other than a bulge, are indicated, but her breasts are shown. Toes are apparent above a small plinth. Serrated relief bands (with a circular feature at the top) and a row of small circles frame the face. A long tunic may be worn, with clavi indicated by painted verticals. She wears short necklaces and a long one with a pendant; there are small impressed circles in the V of this necklace. Two holes are negligently pierced on each side of the head. At the back three incuse lines run from top to bottom, a rather wavy line between two that are straighter; there are uncertain or fortuitous relief patterns near the feet at the back. Two-piece mould. Pink Aswan kaolinite clay, covered overall with a creamy-white slip. Details of decoration, the face, hair and wreath, breasts, clothing and jewellery are picked out in a dark purple-brown fired-on ceramic colour, with touches of orange.
