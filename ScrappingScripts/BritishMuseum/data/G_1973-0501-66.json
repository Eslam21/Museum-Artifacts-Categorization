{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.66"], "Description": [" Terracotta seated youth. A naked youth, modelled in the round and seated on a rectangular plinth, his legs extended before him, the knees slightly raised. From between his legs a colossal phallus curves up to rest its glans on the side of his head. Both his arms stretch out to hold the phallus, but his right hand is thrust inside a round-bottomed pot with a substantial rim. His face is turned to his right and his head is shaven except for a side-lock that hangs down his back. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous deep brown Nile silt with a coat of white dressing, much of which remains. The flesh is painted pink, except for the glans, which is coloured dark pink; the top of the plinth was painted bright blue, and the pot appears to have been black.
