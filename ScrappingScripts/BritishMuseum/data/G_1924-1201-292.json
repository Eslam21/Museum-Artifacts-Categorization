Lemos describes the sherd as belonging to the Group of Light-Walled Naukratis Animal Chalices. All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 981). However, the lack of decoration on the interior of the chalice, the metopal arrangement on the vase's exterior and the depiction of the sphinx and filling ornaments, which can find parallels with the sphinx and ornaments on the Aphrodite Bowl (British Museum 1888,0601.456), suggest that this chalice is of the Wild Goat Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
