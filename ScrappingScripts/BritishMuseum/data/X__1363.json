Belongs to the Zweifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIA3 (Baitinger 2001, figs 150-4) typical of the Anatolian, Turkish and Ionian region, adopted around the Greek world between the second half of the 7th century BC and the 5th century BC (Snodgrass 1964, 151 double edged Form 3A1 dated to before c.600 to 460 BC), though this form specifically can be dated to the late 7th to mid 6th centuries BC. Parallels from Marathon in the British Museum include BM GR 1864,0220.69. Erdmann supplies a very broad range of dates (Erdmann 1973, 45 Form DIIa, dated 8th-4th centuries BC, or possibly an even longer range).
