This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of early Classical Greek date (broadly 500BC to 425BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Protome busts were produced in East Greece, Greece and Southern Italy. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019, though numerous production places likely existed across East Greece. Joining fragments from at least two protomes from the same mould were found at Naukratis. The fragments include two heads (NA350 joins NA355; NA354 joins NA854) and 5 joining body fragments (NA390 joins NA850, NA426, NA803 and NA509). Close parallels, probably from the same mould, from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.120, no.2525, who notes three copies from the same mould, Type B2) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 238, GR1885, 1213.41). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the early and late 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100). Protomes (also called busts, shoulder-busts, protome-busts and erroneously \u2018masks\u2019) were first made in East Greece around 550BC (Croissant 1983) then Greece (Robinson 1931; 1933; 1952; Szab\u00f3 1994) and Magna Graeca (Kilmer 1977, 65-7) in the late Archaic period. The earliest forms simply show the head with a framing veil, though increased complexity and details resulted in half of the figure being represented by the 5th century BC (Mandel & Gossel-Raeck 2004). By the mid 5th century they become less common, though rare finds have been found, in Hellenistic contexts (Kilmer 1977, 66; Smith 1949, 355; Stampolid\u0113s et al. 2011, 383, no. 72). Protomes are primarily found in sanctuaries, graves (possibly reused Kilmer 1977, 68; not used as funeral masks, Smith 1949, 355) and occasionally in domestic contexts (Higgins 1954; Kilmer 1977, 68). Protomes have been interpreted as representations of Hera, Athena, Aphrodite (Aphrodite in Naukratis, Smith 1949, 355, fn. 3, figs. 6 & 7), Demeter or Kore as a chthonic goddess (contra Blinkenberg 1931, 588-9), but are more commonly thought to represent the devotee (ibid; Croissant 1983).
