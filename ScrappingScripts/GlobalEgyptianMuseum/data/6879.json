The inside surface, which is black, shows traces of a heavy horizontal burnish. The exterior surface, the rim of which is black, elsewhere bears a red slip and was the object of a burnish that created a rippled effect (hence \"rippled ware\"). On this surface, part of a design featuring pivoting punctuations (\"dents de loup\" or \"wolf's teeth\"), arranged both vertically and horizontally, has been preserved. It was created in order to enhance the rippled effect."}
