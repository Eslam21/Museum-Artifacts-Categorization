Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88, esp. 86 for this piece). This scaraboid belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 102, 106-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B32-35, see especially B32 for this piece). Scholars tend to translate such composition by \"son of Ra\" or see a cryptographic reading of the god name Amun (Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55).
