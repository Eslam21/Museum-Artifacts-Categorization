", " The scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII C, see especially C8 for this piece) and produced in Naukratis (on the various productions of the 'Scarab Factory', see Webb forthcoming). Gorton identified relatively similar motifs as debased inscriptions, possibly mentioning the name men-ib-Ra - which should be corrected in Menekhib, the Horus name of Psamtek II - or wah-ib-Ra (Gorton 1996, 106). This debased inscription could also be a play between the name of the god Amun-Ra written in a cryptic way (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) and the name of the pharaoh Wahibre, likely to be Apries since the activity of the 'Scarab Factory' is mainly dated to 600-570 BC. Petrie illustrated a number of different versions for this type of inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 65-70). He published this piece as a scarab and not a scaraboid (no. 66), though its reverse is quite similar to the scaraboid no. 65.
