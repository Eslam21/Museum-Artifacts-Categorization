", " Lemos identifies the same sherd as both a Grand Style chalice (1991, 281) and a Chalice Style kantharos (1991, 297). Although painted inscriptions are frequently found on kantharoi, they are not exclusive to those vessels. Very little remains of the figural representation, it could belong to either group. For parallels, see British Museum 1924,1201.390. If this sherd belongs to a kantharos, it belongs in Williams' Type A group (Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169). Kantharoi in this group are dated between 600BC-575BC and these predate the Chalice Style.
