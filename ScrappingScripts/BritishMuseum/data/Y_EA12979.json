{"artifact_name": "tile", "Object Type": ["tile"], "Museum number": ["EA12979"], "Description": [" Grey glazed composition tile depicting a rekhyt bird seated upon a mosaic neb-basket. The rekhyt is represented as a lapwing (a crested plover) with human arms raised in adoration and its wings pinioned behind its back. The basket is decorated with a mosaic of small squares arranged in a diagonal pattern, which originally alternated between three colours: the main body of the tile and inlays, which are almost completely lost, apart from two in blue and red. The inlays from its eye and a scroll pattern on its body are also missing. The background of the tile behind the rekhyt bird is rough and may originally have been overlaid with another colour of glazed composition. The tile is broken on the left and right hand sides, but the remains of the another hand behind the bird suggests that the fragment was part of a longer scroll of a repeated rekhyt bird-pattern. The back and top and bottom sides are relatively flat.

The neb-basket upon which it stands represents the hieroglyph for all, thus meaning \u2018all subject peoples\u2019. Tile inlays often featured on the doorframes, columns, cavetto cornices, and throne pedestals of New Kingdom palaces and temples, set into recesses in the stone and mud brick (Arnold 2003, 20-1). This tile was found in the remains of the palace of Ramses III at Tell el-Yahudiya, along with other decorative tiles featuring rosettes, foreign captives, cartouches, and floral friezes of lotus flowers and grapes. William Flinders Petrie\u2019s excavations at Tell el-Yahudiya uncovered additions to the town made by Ramses III, including a thick mud brick enclosure wall and a palace. The remains of the palace included a large red granite column base, calcite pavement blocks, and remnants of glazed tiles, as well as calcite decorative inlays featuring the cartouche of Ramses III and fragments depicting human and leonine elements (Petrie 1906, 8, 17, pl. 16A). The tile is made of a glazed composition, also known as faience. The body of the tile was likely shaped with a mould, and the inlays would have been made separately and applied freehand.
