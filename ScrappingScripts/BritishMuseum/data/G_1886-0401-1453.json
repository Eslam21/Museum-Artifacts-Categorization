The groove on the underside was intended to fit onto the ridge of the body, such as on a smaller figurine parallel GR1886,0401.1422, dated to the same period. See the parallel NA620 from Naukratis now in the Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology. A similar figurine from Gela Acropolis is dated between 650 and 640 BC (Stampolidis 2003, 384, no.577 Archaeological Museum of Gela inv. no. 8378). Stampolidis, N.C.
