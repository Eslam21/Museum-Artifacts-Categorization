This extraordinary set of moulded green glazed composition game pieces (seven jackals and ten Bes-headed figures) almost certainly accompanied an elaborate board, now lost, for the funerary 'senet' game. The jackals, which personify the \"souls (or bas) of the west\" were viewed as protectors of the dead and of the sun god whose ship they were thought to tow. In the same way they would have been thought appropriate allies of a player. As game pieces they would probably have been thought efficacious in defending the \"deceased\" player in his simulated journey with the sun god through the realms of night on the 'senet' board.
