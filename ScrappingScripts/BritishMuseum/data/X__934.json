This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Gutch dates this piece between 150BC and 250AD based upon its stratigraphic position (a surface find), though he mentions the possibility that it could be earlier (Hogarth 1899 pl. 12. no.143). A good parallel, possibly from the same mould was dated 5th to 4th century BC (Bayer-Niemeier 1988, pl. 83.6, no. 456). This was probably made in Naukratis, with examples found at the site, now in Cambridge Museum of CLassical Archaeology (NA614, NA588) and Bristol Museum (H841). Similar style unprovenanced pieces are generally dated 5th to early 4th century BC or end of the Late Period (Fischer 1994, pl. 2. no. 9; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1998, 52-3, nos. 48-50). Unprovenanced parallel in same pose (but taller, 11cm tall) in Cairo Museum (CG 27091 = SR5/1045). Similar piece, but different mould series, dated to the Ptolemaic period in the Petrie Museum (UC48375). Bayer Niemeier, E. 1988. Liebieghaus Museum Alter Plastik. Bildwerke der Sammlung Kaufmann, 1.
