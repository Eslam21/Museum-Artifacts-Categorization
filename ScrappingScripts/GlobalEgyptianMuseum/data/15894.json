The one illustrated here, partially restored, was originally a single block of stone with a rounded roof. The right-hand exterior face contains a double scene reminiscent of the art of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. To the left, Nectanebo the First, wearing the Red Crown and a double kilt, advances under the sun disk with uraei, or royal cobras, and offers an image of the goddess Maat to Thoth. The latter is depicted in the form of a crouching baboon on a high pedestal, crowned with a sun disk and lunar crescent. In the second scene, to the right, the god Onuris-Shu, crowned by four tall feathers and dressed in a long garment, offers another Maat image to the mummy-shaped deity Osiris-Onnuphris. Inside the naos, Nectanebo the Second offers a Maat image to the Abydene divinities and to Hathor, but the relief is poorly preserved."}
