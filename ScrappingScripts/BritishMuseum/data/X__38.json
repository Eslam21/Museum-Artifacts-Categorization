", " The sherd joins British Museum 1888,0601.465.a and Louvre E8056 bis.22 and belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.465.b, 1888,0601.465.c, 1888,0601.465.d, 1888,0601.465.e, 1924,1201.537 and London UCL 751 and UCL 393. Also British Museum 1965,0930.338 probably belongs to the same vase. Fairbanks describes the sherd as coming from a krater. Lemos describes the sherd as coming from a mediocre, but very big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1).
