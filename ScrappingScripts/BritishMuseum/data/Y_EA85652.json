{"artifact_name": "lid", "Object Type": ["lid"], "Museum number": ["EA85652"], "Description": [" Relatively thick clay disc-shaped of brown fine Nile clay with mica as inclusions. The underside is flat but slightly convex, the upper side is flat with a central enhancement, partly quite eroded. In the surface around the raised part many small holes were impressed into the clay in several oval clusters. The edges of the clay disc are rounded. The function of this object is not clear, maybe it was used as a lid? The thickness, the heavy weights as well as the decoration might suggest another function.
