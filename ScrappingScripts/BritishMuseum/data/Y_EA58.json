A thousand years later, the sphinx had come to be revered as a god called Horemakhet: \u2018Horus in the horizon\u2019. Some pharaohs repaired and renewed already ancient monuments and they duly advertised their sacred work. In the 18th Dynasty, a Prince Thutmose fell asleep in the shadow of the Great Sphinx. It purportedly spoke to him in a dream, promising Egypt\u2019s throne but pleading to be freed of accumulated sands. On taking the throne, Thutmose IV did clear and repair the sphinx. The plaited beard was likely his work. The new beard had a curved tip, which identified the wearer as a god. The original beard from Khafra\u2019s time would have been straight \u2013 a king\u2019s. The new beard, too, eventually broke off, but fragments were found between the front paws in the 19th century. Other portions are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
