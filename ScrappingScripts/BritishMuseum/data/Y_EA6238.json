{"artifact_name": "plaque", "Object Type": ["plaque"], "Museum number": ["EA6238"], "Description": [" Fragment of a plaque: fragment of an opaque red glass plaque preserving at its right edge the profile of a man facing left. Although he has neither royal nor divine insignia, he is probably intended to be a king as he wears a bag-wig of mosaic glass composed of white and blue circles. At the top of the headdress are two incomplete cone-like projections in green and blue mosaic glass. The flesh is in opaque yellow glass. At the extreme left edge are two small areas of relief in blue and white too incomplete to be identified. It is probable that they were objects held in the outstretched arms of this figure. The reliefs were moulded and presumably fused to the background.
