{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86925"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression showing one large rows of basketry coil impressions at the one side and one smaller coil at another side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. At the side a complete impression of a thumb. The clay was hardened after excavation leading to a darker discolouration. The front shows one impression of a scarab-like seal, with finger impressions around it. The seal impression shows a circumferential band that thickens in one part into a plant-like decoration in the upper right corner. On the left a falcon facing to the left, with a flagellum, right of it a small hippopotamus and on top of it a lying antelope or ibex with its head bent towards its back to the right. Underneath the hippopotamus and the falcon a lying crocodile facing to the left. The same motif is found on S9.
