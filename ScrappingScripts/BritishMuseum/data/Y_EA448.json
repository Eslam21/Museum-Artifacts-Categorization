{"artifact_name": "lintel", "Object Type": ["lintel"], "Museum number": ["EA448"], "Description": [" Limestone lintel of Huy: the surface of this lintel bears two scenes with representations in sunk relief and incised texts. On the left the chief craftsman Huy stands with his arms raised in adoration before the seated figures of Amun-Ra and Mut. Between Huy and the deities stand one altar heaped with offerings and another altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. On the right side of the lintel the workman Mr(.\u1ec9)-W\u0292st stands with arms raised in worship before Amenhotep I and Ahmose-Nefertari who are seated on thrones. Two altars, one with offerings and another with a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower, also stand before the deities. The lintel is broken into three fragments, now joined, with some loss to the scene on the left side. The edges are worn and chipped. There are traces of red paint on the bodies, the dresses of the goddesses and parts of the thrones as well as on some of the offerings on the left side. There are traces of blue paint on the wig and crown of Amenhotep I and parts of the thrones, and black paint on the wig of Huy.
