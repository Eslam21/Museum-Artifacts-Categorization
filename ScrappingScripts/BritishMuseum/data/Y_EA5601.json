{"artifact_name": "drawing-board", "Object Type": ["drawing-board"], "Museum number": ["EA5601"], "Description": [" Wooden drawing board: this object consists of a rectangular wooden board covered with a thin layer of plaster. Originally a squared grid, ruled in red, covered the whole of one side of the board, the other side is blank. The grid still remains on the left half of the inscribed surface, where a seated figure of a king has been drawn. At some time, the grid was erased from the right side. On this part of the board there is now a well-drawn rendering of the quail chick hieroglyph; seven awkwardly drawn versions of a forearm with outstretched hand, also a hieroglyph; and a small sketch identifiable as a loaf of bread impressed with the imprint of fingers, since similar loaves are found among piles of offerings in temple and tomb scenes. The clumsy forearms are clearly by a different hand from those that drew either the king's figure or the quail chick. In each case, the outline of the arm itself is ruled, not drawn freehand, as was the usual practice, and the length of the thumb in relation to the fingers has presented a problem in at least two of the examples. To obtain the correct orientation of the forearms, one must turn the board upside down. Two cartouches are drawn in association with the king's figure; both contain the throne name Menkheperkare. This name was used by Thutmosis III during the time of his co-regency with Hatshepsut, as an alternative to his more usual prenomen, Menkheperre.
