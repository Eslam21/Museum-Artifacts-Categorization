{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA85675"], "Description": [" Fragment of an ostracon from a pottery vessel. Three, possibly four lines of hieratic written in black ink. Three of them on top, a possible fourth one at the bottom on the right side. In the middle several figures of animals. At the top left an unidentified standing bird, facing right, in front of it a small element that looks like a pile of some sort. Underneath the birds feet a sun disc with a possible horn attached, the rest of the figure is not preserved. To the right of this a ram head with a sun disc and an uraeus on top of an enigmatic object that might be a stand of some sort. The vessel is made of Nile clay, closed shape, wheel made. On the outside a red coating of a lighter red colour, on top of this is the hieratic and the figures drawn. On top of the writing and figures several vertical lines of a darker red colour which partly cover the text and pictures. The lines look like polishing lines. This means that the vessel or parts of it(?) were probably reused. The right hand edge is covered in salt crust on front, break and rear of the object.
