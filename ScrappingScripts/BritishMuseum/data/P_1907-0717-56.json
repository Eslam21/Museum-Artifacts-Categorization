There are two details that distinguish this drawing from the others of the series: the saint in the centre is depicted as a youth without a beard and the female nude on the left seen from behind is holding her left hand behind her back, while making an offering with the other. The head of the pig, which appears also in nos. 1907-7-17-52 (see under this entry for further comment) 55, 58, 65-68, 71 and 72, should be a clue for the identification of the saint with Antony Abbot. Indeed this sheet is rather interesting for, despite the fact that the iconography of St. Antony is normally that of an elderly bearded man, the 'Golden Legend' recounts that Antony was only twenty years old when he went to the desert for his hermitage (cf. L. R\u00e9au, 'Iconographie de l'Art Chr\u00e9tien', Paris 1958, vol. III, p. 108). See also nos. 45 and 50. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
