It is supported by a rectangular panel held by a man standing on the right side of the panel. The man has almost shoulder-length hair. He is wearing a belt over his robe; the belt is tied in the front and the robe extends to his neck. The man is dancing with the bear over a machine. Most of the funerary panels, especially those found near Alexandria in monasteries, were carved from limestone, as the quarries of El Maks are near Alexandria, and also from Aswan, Akhmim, and Ashmunein. Some are sandstone, others limestone, and sometimes white marble. Some funerary panels are triangular, while others are oblong with gables at the top. "}
