The rear shows a convex impression of a textile or leather object, probably a bag. Two thick impressions of a turned string with a width of 0.3 cm. At the convex upper side the upper half of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible, the sides are bending downwards and show many finger impressions. The seal shows a circumferential line, inside a seated falcon, it has both wings stretched in front of the body, is facing to the left and wears the double crown and a flagellum but with a slightly rounded end.
