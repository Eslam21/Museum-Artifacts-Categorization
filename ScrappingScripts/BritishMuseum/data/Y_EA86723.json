{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86723"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression, the rear shows a curved impression of either wood or plant material, perpendicular to this on two sides turned string impressions of about 0.25cm width. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica and was hardened after the excavation. Small cracks are visible on the surface. The slightly rounded top shows parts of a scarab-like seal impression as well as finger prints. The seal shows a standing figure with apron in the middle, holding a staff, facing to the left. Above it a sun disc with (two?) uraei. Left of the figure a seated baboon facing to the left and therefore showing his rear towards the figure. Underneath maybe a nsw-sign. At the right of the figure not much is preserved, remains of one sign.
