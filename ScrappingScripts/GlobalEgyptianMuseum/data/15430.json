This type of statuette served as a figurative embodiment of the human pharaoh, enabling the magic rituals in the celebration of religious rites connected with Aten. The rigid posture of the king with his legs together is unusual and can only be explained by the solemnity of the act of making an offering to Aten. The body of the king is realistically portrayed with a swollen belly and a serious expression on his face. He wears the Blue Crown, an official crown related to the coronation ceremony of the king."}
