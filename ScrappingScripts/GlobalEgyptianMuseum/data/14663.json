The artist used white marble in a marvelous way while creating it. The chest has no decoration. It differs in this respect from preceding sarcophagi, which were decorated on three sides; the front and the two short sides. The back, however, was left without any decoration, because it was placed against the wall of the tomb. Therefore, this chest was not used as a sarcophagus."}
