", " Copies of this terracotta figure were very common at Naukratis. These are commonly dated from the 5th to the 4th century BC. This may present Priapus or a satyr. Numerous parallels from the same or similar mould were found, and most likely produced, at Naukratis (Brussels Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A1831; Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA590, NA615, NA616 and NA634; Cairo National Museum (SR5/ 6219). Others probably come from Naukratis (Bailey 2008, nos 3218-3221, British Museum GR1973,0501.25, GR1973,0501.46, GR1973,0501.52, GR1973,0501.73; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.142.1914, E.123.1914, E.82.1914, E.92.1914 and E.133.1914 and similar larger piece E.105.1914). Unprovenanced examples from Egypt have been dated to the Late 4th century BC (Fischer 1994, pl. 2, no.11 and 10; Vogt 1924, pl. 85, no.3; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, pl.83.3, no. 454) or erroneously dated to the Roman period (Dunand 1990, no. 804, and similar 806). Similar ithyphallic figure plaques have been found at Naukratis (British Museum GR1973,0501.36, GR1965,0930.27, GR1973,0501.42; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.136.1914; and Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA585).
