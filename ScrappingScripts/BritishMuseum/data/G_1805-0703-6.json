{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["1805,0703.6"], "Description": [" Marble group of an acrobat on a crocodile: the surface is in good condition. Restored are the head, tail and front paws of the crocodile; the right leg, left knee, left foot, and elbows of the acrobat; and part of the plinth. The figure of the boy has been repaired at waist level. The young boy is precariously balanced on top of the back of a crocodile. His hands grasp the rear end of the crocodile, and he appears to be pushing himself up using his shoulder muscles. His back and legs are almost perfectly straight, and his head faces outwards, mouth open and the features contorted with effort. The boy has corkscrew locks and African features. The crocodile's head is restored with an open mouth, baring his sharp teeth, but how the original appeared we cannot know.

", " Cook 2013, nr.339: Townley's description; \u2018A group of a Priapeid genius placed with its legs upwards, and the breast resting upon the back of a Crocodile. It is near three feet high, and was brought from Rome by Mr Campbell of Stackpole, who gave it to the present owner\u2019 (Parlour Catalogue owned by Simon Townley, street parlour 25). In 1804 Parlour Catalogue (street parlour 13), the figure is described as \u2018the Genius of production\u2019. The crocodile\u2019s head might originally have contained a pipe for a fountain, as in a similar piece currently in Rome, where the acrobat contains a pipe (Hill; recognised as acrobat by Combe). Presented to Townley by the first Baron Cawdor (not, as stated by Smith, the first Earl) by 1796. Two sculptures (1805,0703.25 and 6) brought from Rome were presented to Townley by John Campbell, first Baron Cawdor. Since the earlier documents that mention them refer to the donor as \u2018Mr Campbell of Stackpole\u2019, the gift presumably antedated 21 June 1796, when the Barony of Cawdor was created (for the date, see Burke\u2019s Peerage, s.v. Cawdor). This is consistent with the appearance of 1805,0703.25 in the watercolour of the dining room by Chambers, for which Townley paid in March 1796 (Wigan Accounts).
