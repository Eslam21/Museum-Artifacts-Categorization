At least six foundation deposits were discovered in Ptolemy II gateway of the Great Temenos, one at each of the four corners and one at the northwest and southwest corners of a central hall (Petrie 1886, 28-31, pl. XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). Thirteen pegs were discovered in the foundation deposits: four in the north-east corner, two in the south-east one, three in the south-west one and four in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. XXV no. 7-10). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the south-east or south-west corner of the pylon. According to Weinstein, the identification of these model tools is not ascertained since they look like various elements, such as \u201crollers (for moving large blocks of stones), boning rods, mallets (for hammering the stakes into the ground at the foundation ceremony), or possibly even burnishing tools\u201d (Weinstein 1973, 377, note 70). The peg identification by Petrie seems however particularly relevant since they were found by four in two of the deposits; they could be therefore linked with the demarcation of the four corners of a building, a well-known step in a foundation ceremony (Petrie 1886, 29).
