See also GR 1934,0309.3 from Naukratis. Standardised figurine of a type dated to the second half of 7th century BC, though excellent parallel from the end of the 7th century BC (Karageorghis 1995, 49-51, pl. 25.3 Type I(viii)37, see also 34-38 from Idalion, Ayia Irini, Ayios Georghios Spatharikou and Samos). The longevity of this subject is illustrated by stone sculptures of Cypriot temple-boys with earrings and pointed cap with head-cloth falling down on neck, in a later style, dated to the second half of the fifth century BC (Beer 1994, pls 84.d, 86.b 87.e-g). Erroneously identified by Petrie as a limestone female figurine head. This is from the earliest level in the first temple to Apollo of the Milesians that Petrie dates this to later 7th century BC, citing this as evidence for a circa 620 BC date for the foundation of this temple (Petrie 1886, 14, pl. 2.5).
