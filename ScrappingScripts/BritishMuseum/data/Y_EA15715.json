The form is that of a developed snake ring. The hoop is curved round to form a circle, and then the ends curve back from the hoop, with one end terminating in a snake's head, while the other has the body of a hawk. The bird's feathers are indicated by light cross-hatching for the wings held close to the body, and incised ripple marks for the belly. The scales of the snake are indicated with cross-hatching.
