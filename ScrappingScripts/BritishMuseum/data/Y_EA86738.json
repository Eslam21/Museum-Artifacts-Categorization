{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86738"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows a slightly concave area with wood impressions, probably of a knob or bolt from a box. Perpendicular to this two string impressions with a width of 0.3 cm. The front is flat with rounded edges, covered in finger impressions. In the flat area two thirds of a very round impression of a seal that seemed to have been divided into three parts by horizontal lines. The upper one is not preserved, the middle part shows a central kheper with one seated god on each side, facing inwards, the left one with a beard, the right one with a falcon(?) head and another sign above the head. In the lowest row a central Falcon facing to the left, on each side of it what looks like a stylized Hr-sign (D2). Seemed to have sealed the identical object that was closed also with EA86739 but with another seal impression on it.
