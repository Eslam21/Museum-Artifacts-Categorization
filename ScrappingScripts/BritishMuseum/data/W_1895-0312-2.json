A second die for a ra\u1e6dl of meat, that of OA+ 4357, is found on another piece (Balog 1976, 65) accompanied by the same counterstamp dated 114 as appears on OA+ 4379. This shows that the stamp of 1895,0312.2 and 1895,1220.4 was in use before the one associated with the stamp of 114, a year nearly at the end of \u02bfUbayd\u0101ll\u0101h's exceptionally long period of office.
