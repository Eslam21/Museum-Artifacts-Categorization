This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to the Egypt Exploration Fund list, the Redpath Museum received in 1887 several \"paste objects\" from the Scarab Factory, along with two moulds. This amulet might come from such a context. This symbol of Osiris' backbone, associated to ideas of stability, is a very common funerary amulet. A similar Djed pillar surmounted by an Atef crown is dated to the 26th dynasty (M\u00fcller-Winkler 1987, Kat. 664), though such composition can date to the general Late and even Ptolemaic periods (Andrews 1994, 83, fig. 84a).
