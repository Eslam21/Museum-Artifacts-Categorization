Indeed, in the notes to plate CXXXV where he explicitly discusses and illustrates (1b, 2 and 4) what he regarded as incense burners ('censers'), he also mentioned examples of braziers found at Kition and Salamis (p. 444 and notes ** and ***; also pp. 478-9) but not at Achna. Note that when O-R says that 'censers abounded in the cult of Artemis at Achna' (1893, 328), he is actually referring primarily to the limestone ring-dancer groups (see pl. CXXXV, 5-6). If the brazier fragments in this group do come from Cyprus, then they probably originated from other sites explored by O-R but but they may not necessarily have any connection with his excavations. For stratified examples of this type from Paphos, see Hayes 1991, 75-7 and plate XVIII, 1, 6, 10 (with additional references; see also Conze 1891). An example in the Louvre (Fourrier and Queyrel 1998, no. 515), not recognised as a brazier by the authors and whose Cypriot provenance is not certain, combines a bull head on one side with a lion on the other., Bibliography: Conze, A. 1891, Griechische Kohlenbecken, JDAI V, 118-141.
