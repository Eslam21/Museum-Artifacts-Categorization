Traces of the glue covered part of the text. Three lines of hieratic written in black ink. The first is written in a neat and small hand writing. Underneath a two signs of a larger and clearly different hand writing, followed by a much smaller signs. The third line is written in tall signs again like the beginning of the second line. The vessel is made of marl or imported clay, probably an amphora, wheel made. On the inside remains of a brown substance that could be related to the gluing though its different to the glue between the two sherd. Bits of clay are stuck onto to the inside from the production of the vessel.
