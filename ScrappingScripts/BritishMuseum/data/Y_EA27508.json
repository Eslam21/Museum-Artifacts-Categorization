The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of Naukratis provided a wide variety of models of ceremonial instruments and tools. Fourteen were made of copper alloy, ten of stone and four of iron. Four mortars were discovered in the foundation deposits, one in each corner (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. 26 no. 34). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this mortar was found at the south-east corner of the pylon. Two-handled mortars do not seem to appear before the 30th dynasty in foundation deposits (Weinstein 1973, 298). The earliest known example comes from a foundation deposit belonging to a destroyed temple of Nectanebo in Abydos (Petrie 1902, 33, pl. 70, no. 11; Weinstein 1973, 345, no. 150).
