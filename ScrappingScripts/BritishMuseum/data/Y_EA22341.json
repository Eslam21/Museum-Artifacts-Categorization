{"artifact_name": "jar", "Object Type": ["jar"], "Museum number": ["EA22341"], "Description": [" A tall jar of red siltware pottery, with a blunt, pointed base, rounded shoulder and short, cylindrical neck. The shape of the body is slightly irregular, with a degree of distortion in the diameter and a depression in the lower part of the side. The sides were worked quite thin, so much so that they became fragile and there is a hole broken through at one side. The compact red silt fabric contains particles of grit and is covered on the exterior by a smooth red slip, parts of which have been lost, especially on the shoulder.
