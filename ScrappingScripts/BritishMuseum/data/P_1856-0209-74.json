It is an early work, in which the figures still show a certain stiffness and awkwardness. Another impression is in Dresden. For a discussion of Robetta's oeuvre see Hind D.II.4 (P&D Kk.8.30). The entire composition is a reverse and simplified copy of Schongauer's 'Flight into Egypt' (Bartsch 7; Hollstein 7), while the turreted town in the background is borrowed from D\u00fcrer\u0092s \u0091Choice of Hercules\u0092 (Bartsch 73; Hollstein 63). From its dimensions and shape the engraving was possibly engraved on the same plate as the 'Man of Sorrow' (Hind D.II.39; M. J. Zucker, 'The Illustrated Bartsch, Commentary', vol. 25, part 2, 1984, p. 549, no. 024)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hind 1938-48 / Early Italian Engraving, a critical catalogue (D.II.38) ", " TIB / The Illustrated Bartsch (25.2521.013) ", " Hollstein / German engravings, etchings and woodcuts c.1400-1700 (7 d) (Copy after Schongauer) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: St Joseph ", " Representation of: Virgin Mary ", " Representation of: Jesus Christ "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: A E Evans & Sons"], "Acquisition date": ["1856"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1856,0209.74"]}
