{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA35898"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela: this round-topped stela consists of three registers. In the upper section there was a winged sun-disk with uraei. There may have been a jackal on each side, but only a few hieroglyphs of the name can be distinguished. In the middle register the deceased stands on the right in adoration of Osiris, Hapy (?), and Imsety. Below are four lines of text. The stela is in a poor state of preservation. The surface is badly cracked and worn, so much of the decoration is lost or faded. At the top the black edges of the wing and uraeus on the right survive. It appears that the upper wing was green and the middle wing red, and this section had a red lower border. The human figure in the middle has a red body and apparently a white garment edged in black. The bodies of the gods are red, but only the black outlines of the faces remain, apart from that of Osiris which appears to be green. The texts are black between red lines, but are largely illegible. There appears to have been a red border around the stela and the sides.
