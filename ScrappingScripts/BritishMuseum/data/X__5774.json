", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). On amulets of Bes in general see: Andrews 1994, 38-40; Herrmann et al. 2010, 69-73 (type 34). Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London. Edgar, C.
