", " Two labels that were found in the box indicated finds from the Temple of Apollo in Naukratis, VIth cent. B.C. They concerned a \"glazed-sand figure\" and a \"glazed-sand head\". This glazed composition figure however seems later in date. As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69).
