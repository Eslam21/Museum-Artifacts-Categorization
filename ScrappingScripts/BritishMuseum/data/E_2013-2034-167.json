All figures are upright and face right. The three dogs are depicted in parallel, one on top of the other with legs slightly outstretched, with the topmost bearing down at an angle towards the sheep. To the right of the sheep is a collection of pecked marks forming an unidentified shape similar to two more at the left of the image. At the top right is the pecked, infilled form of another figure (ostrich?) possibly touching another more eroded ostrich adjacent. To the right of this are two deeply incised straight legs with no apparent body. At the bottom right is another faint, pecked unidentified outline and random pecking marks are scattered over the surface of the tableau. A 10cm scale has been fitted at the bottom of the image.

There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " mammal ", " bird ", " dog "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi Hamra "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.167"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWHA0020013 (TARA number) "]}
