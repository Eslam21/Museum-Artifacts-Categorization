{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1913:337", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "EL-RIQQEH", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "0.5 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small green-glazed seal-amulet in the shape of the scarab-beetle, with a talismanic selection of simple hieroglyphs incised on the base. Such signs appear on scarabs produced in Palestine during the late Middle Kingdom and 2nd Intermediate Period, by craftsmen who knew of hieroglyphs, but could not read and write the script, and were doubtless not themselves Egyptian. They are frequently found in Egypt. The cemetery where this was excavated lies near the villages of el-Riqqeh and Girza, not far from the Residence of the Middle Kingdom kings at Itjtawy (probably modern el-Lisht). The piece was found in the intact New Kingdom burial of a woman, whose body lay in a grave measuring 90 by 60 by 85 inches, the head to the east and the face turned to the north. The coffin was of pottery, and the grave-goods included two stone cosmetic dishes, a stone snake-amulet, blue glass beads, a mirror, two gold penannular ear-rings, and a cowrie-shaped seal-amulet. Together the group presents the items of adornment treasured by a relatively well-to-do lady of the late 18th Dynasty, when Egypt was at the peak of her power, about 1350 BC."}
