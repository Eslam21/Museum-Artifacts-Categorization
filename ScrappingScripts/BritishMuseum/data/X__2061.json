", " Gutch dates a similar figure to between 150BC and 250AD. (Gutch in Hogarth 1899; pl. 13, no. 201). Probably locally produced at the Naukratis Terracottas workshop operational in the 3rd to 2nd century BC and possibly later. A number of Harpocrates on goose figures have been found at Naukratis in the British Museum (GR1886,0401.1450), Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA489, NA490), Bristol (H2261) and are dated from the 3rd or 2nd century BC to the early 1st century BC. Harpocrates on goose figure parallels include a 2nd century BC example from Tanis (Bailey 2008, no.3071), an early 1st century BC (Fischer 1994; no. 616). Roman period Harpocrates on goose figures are more stylised and less naturalistic (Dunand 1990; Fischer 1994; Fjeldhagen 1995; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995). Dunand, F. 1990. Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.
