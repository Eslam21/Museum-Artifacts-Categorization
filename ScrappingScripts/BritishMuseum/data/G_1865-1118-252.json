{"artifact_name": "relief", "Object Type": ["relief"], "Museum number": ["1865,1118.252"], "Description": [" Marble relief carved with an erotic scene in a boat. The preserved part of the relief shows the prow of a boat at which stands a boatman in a pointed hat. Behind him a man and a woman perform a sexual act, and above them is a sail. In front of the boat is the rear of a hippo, and alongside are two dolphins. A flower and two lines by the hippo could be part of the shoreline. It is possible that the lovers on the boat represent (and caricature) Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII.
