{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA57348"], "Description": [" Limestone trial-piece: the left side is damaged and the edges are rough. The block is worked on the top and right side. There is a substantial hole at the back of the plaque, possibly for hanging. There is evidence of errors and reworking, seen clearly on the male portrait, where the original lines of the face have been re-cut but are still visible. This piece shows two heads ,in sunk relief, facing each other; on the left is a young royal male, identified by the lock of Horus and uraeus, and around his neck is an aegis. The accompanying male wears a circle of cobras crown, an echloned tripartite wig and vulture headdress and body over the wig. Because the female has no uraeus it is possible that she was intended to represent a goddess, or a queen fulfilling this role. Both have exceptionally large ears; the female has a small chin, bulging cheeks and fleshy nose, and the ruler has large eyes, a straight, upturned mouth and hooked nose with large nostrils. It is possible that this plaque shows a queen with a young son, possibly Cleopatra I with her son Ptolemy VI or Cleopatra III with one of her sons, Pyolemy IX or X, with whom she ruled as regent.
