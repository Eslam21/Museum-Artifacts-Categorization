{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "8173", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP IV/AMENOPHIS IV/NEFERKHEPERURE/AKHENATEN", "Archaeological Site": "EL-`AMARNA/AKHETATEN", "Category": "AMULET ?", "Material": "CLAY; POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; BURNED", "Height": "6.5 cm", "Name": "Female figurine", "Description": "This figurine, of which the legs are missing, is of rather crude workmanship. Only the front has been modelled. It represents a standing or reclining young woman wearing a long wig, which is painted black. Her appearance is unmistakably linked with the art of El-'Amarna, particularly the posture and the curvaceous lower part of the body. It is not possible to ascertain the exact meaning of the figure. Since she bears no insignia of any kind, we can rule out the possibility that she is a member of the royal household; she may come from a family altar. Considering that she was found amidst the ruins of a house, perhaps she was a fertility amulet."}
