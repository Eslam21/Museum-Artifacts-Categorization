"], "Materials": ["egyptian blue"], "Technique": [" mould-made ", " incised ", " undercut "], "Dimensions": [" Length: 1 centimetres ", " Thickness: 0.50 centimetres ", " Width: 0.80 centimetres "], "Curator's comments": ["The incised style is typical of other scarabs in Egyptian blue produced at Naukratis (on the Scarab Factory production, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites, and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A19-31, see especially A29 for this specimen). The winged sphinx, which is a popular motif on Naukratite products, recalls in its design the sphinx decorating the base of a scarab found in Cyrene (Gorton 1996, 120, Type XXXIII C4), though only one partial wing is visible on BM 1888,0601.56 / EA66523 (Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 53). See also BM 1888,0601.56 / EA35981(Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 55) with a similar 'Bes-headed sphinx' device represented on the underside of a scaraboid in glazed composition.
