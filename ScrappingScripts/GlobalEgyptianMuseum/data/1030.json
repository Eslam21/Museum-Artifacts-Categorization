{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6356", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "SERPENTINITE ?", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "31.5 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a woman statuette", "Description": "This fragment of a statuette represents the lady Noubemousekhet, standing, the left foot forward. She wears a dress pleated on the left breast, leaving the right breast uncovered. The left hand, which was folded on the stomach, gripped a menat-necklace. On the dorsal pillar and the socle are found votive formulae containing the name of the owner. The general aspect and several iconographic details demonstrate that the statuette dates from the 18th Dynasty and more specifically from the reign of Amenhotep III. A petrological examination could not identify with certainty the material of the piece."}
