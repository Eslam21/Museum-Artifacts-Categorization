The couple are seated side-by-side on a broad chair with a high back and lion legs, only three of which are shown. Nebseny holds a rolled, folded piece of cloth, and Senseneb sniffs a fragrant blue lotus. Beneath them are characteristic possessions: a mirror and ointment jar for Senseneb and a carrying case for scribal equipment for Nebseny, who was a copyist in the temple of Ptah at Memphis and in the temples of Upper and Lower Egypt, and a draftsman in the sculptors' workshop. The foodstuffs and flowers heaped before the couple are being offered to them by their son, Ptahmose. Because he is acting as a funerary priest, Ptahmose wears a priest's sidelock. Along with the traditional collar necklace, he wears an amulet in the shape of a heart. Red ink has been used for some details, including the design on Nebseny's scribal case, which is the most conspicuous object in the entire composition. The visual emphasis on this object has been underscored by also giving it a label: \"Holder for writing.\" The case was the emblem of Nebseny's professional identity, and he has left no doubt as to its importance to him. Though the couple face left, the hieroglyphic signs in the prayer above their heads face right, an apparent breach of the rule that people and their inscriptions should be oriented in the same direction. This was doubtless done so that the signs would have the same orientation as the son, to indicate that he is uttering the prayer. However, the writing is also retrograde: instead of reading the columns from right to left, the normal direction for reading rightward-facing hieroglyphs, one must start at the top of the leftmost column, where the opening phrase of the prayer has been helpfully written in red. Since Nebseny's titles indicate that he was an artist-scribe, it is tempting to think that he himself might have drawn this special scene. If so, Nebseny's high forehead and large, prominent jaw, though too stylized to be considered a portrait, may at least suggest his actual (or desired) appearance. Bibliography: G.
