It tells the story of the Egyptian official and army officer Sinuhe, who accidentally learned of the death or assassination of his Sovereign, Amenemhat the First, while the Crown Prince Sesostris the First was on a military campaign in Libya. Sinuhe fled to Syria when he heard this news. At the end of his adventures and his life there, Sinuhe went back home. The king granted him mercy and ordered that a tomb be prepared for him. Sennedjem, the chief artisan at Deir el-Medina, probably took this ostracon to his tomb as a favorite story to read during his long voyage in the afterlife."}
