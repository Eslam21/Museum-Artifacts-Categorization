{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86263"], "Description": [" Complete scarab, made of light grey steatite. At the highest part of the back the glaze and part of the stone is chipped offed. Some details carved, whitish-grey glaze, with incised lines. No details of the back with elytra and prothorax are shown, except framing lines at the outer edge of the prothorax and at the upper part of the elytra. The area of the head is quite stylized and difficult to see as it is partly destroyed as well. One eye on the left and clypeus is visible, but no partition of the lobes is preserved. The plates are shown with small diagonal lines. The side shows two incised lines leaving a circumferential band for the legs, in the middle at the side of this band four vertical lines. From this point another line is running to indicate the hind leg by running askew downwards. Underneath is the base line. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. Two figures facing each other. On the left Ptah mummy-shaped, with the wAs-sceptre in his both hands. From his head a line that probably shall be an uraeus, at the back of his neck another line that is probably the counterweight of the collar. On the right side a figure in an apron, both arms hanging along the sides of the body, above the head a small sign, maybe a sun disc?
