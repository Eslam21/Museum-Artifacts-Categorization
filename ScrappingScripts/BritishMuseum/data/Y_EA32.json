{"artifact_name": "sarcophagus", "Object Type": ["sarcophagus"], "Museum number": ["EA32"], "Description": [" Black siltstone rectangular sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibra, God's Adorer of Amun, daughter of Psamtek II: the exterior and interior are incised with vertical registers of hieroglyphs, containing prayers and invocations to the gods derived from a number of sources including the 'Pyramid Texts'. The base of the interior is elaborated with a relief representation of Hathor, as goddess of the west; the sarcophagus was later usurped by a priest of Montu, Amenhotep-Pimontu, in the early Roman Period, who is responsible for the addition of the horizontal register of hieroglyphs around the rim and the usurpation of the cartouches. The sarcophagus, hollowed from a single block of stone, has flat exterior surfaces of excellent smoothness, although the stone has not been highly polished. A band some 8-10cm high along the base was left rough, possibly indicating the depth to which the coffin was set into the floor of the burial chamber, in the original interment. On the interior, the sides were cut so as to create a shaped receptacle for the burial, rounded at the head end and widest across the shoulders. Above this shaped area, the upper parts of the sides were cut back to a flat surface, forming a rectangular socket to accommodate the projecting part of the lid. All the upper edge of the foot end of the box has been broken, and some of the loose fragments have now been replaced in position.
