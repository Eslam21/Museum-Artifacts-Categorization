{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA67155"], "Description": [" Fragmentary schist naophorous figure of the male official Bakenkhonsu, shown kneeling on the surviving mid-section of a narrow base. The figure is depicted in a kneeling position and resting on his heels, while the lower portion of a small naos shrine is placed on his lap with his hands supporting the base. The figure wears a short pleated kilt that is belted at the waist, and though little of the upper body survives it is likely that the chest and torso were bare. Part of the lower body of the deity represented within the naos shrine is still intact and based on the mummified form of the body may represent the funerary god Osiris. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar which features two columns of inscribed text, with both the beginning and end of each line now lost. On either side of the remains of the statue base are two horizontal lines of inscription, beginning at the front of the statue base and continuing on the right side. The break across the waist of the male figure includes damage to the arms, with only the forearm on the left side arm intact and the right side arm lost up to the elbow, and the right foot completely missing. There are also several chips across the right side at the arm, left lower leg and heel of the left foot. The front of the statue base is severely damaged, with much of the statue base on both sides and the reverse of the statue now missing. The edges of the back pillar are also damaged.
