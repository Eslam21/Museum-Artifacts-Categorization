An upright rectangular washed border, perhaps drawn on to the sheet at Resta's instigation, shows through from the verso, which is backed down on to the modern, museum mount. Resta's comment on this and three other drawings by Mola (his nos \"m. 142-6\") is an early appreciation of Mola as a painter and draughtsman, and seems worth quoting from the manuscript in full, though it depends on Pellegrino Antonio Orlandi's earlier note on the artist (1704, p. 320). \"Francesco Mola da Lugano, impar\u00f2 da Franc.o Albano naque [sic]/ l'anno 1609 e di 56 di sua et\u00e0 mori il 1665./ Francesco Mola non solo fu celebre Pittore, come ne fano [sic] certa/ testmonianza tante sue opere a fresco ed oglio nella Citta di Roma./ Ma si diletto anco di caricare alla Caraccesca, come si vede dalle/ due qui poste caricature, e molte del Mola passano sicure per caricature/ de Carracci. Piaque in oltro al Mola il Schizzare alla Guercinesca e nel dipinto/ s'accosto a quella grande e celebre Maniera, che diede/ lume a tanti pittori fra quelle oscurit\u00e0 della prima/ Maniera, di non fare li quadri tanto levali e bassi di/ colore.\" The erroneous birth and death dates given by Orlandi and Resta were also followed by Richardson (see Pp,4.89). The drawing is typical of Mola's style of the 1640s.
