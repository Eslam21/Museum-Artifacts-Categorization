This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). This is a relatively unusual amulet for a Bes and actually unique in Naukratis corpus. According to its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. It might have been a product of the workshop. The fine paste, pale yellow in colour, recall the paste used for numerous scarabs produced at the Scarab Factory.
