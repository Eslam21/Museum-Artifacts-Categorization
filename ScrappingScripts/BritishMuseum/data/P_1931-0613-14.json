", " Bowers catalogue entry Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) Study of a musician for The Queen of Sheba\u2019s Visit to King Solomon, c.1883-89 Black and white chalk on terracotta paper, 379 x 273 mm PD 1931-6-13-14 Presented by Charles Francis Bell The Biblical account of Sheba\u2019s visit to Solomon described \u201charps ... and psalteries for singers\u201d (1 Kings 10:12) and Poynter included an impressive array of musicians to welcome the foreign monarch. The painter supplemented his research into the details of the painting from his visits to the British Museum with published material. He imagined Solomon\u2019s musicians to have been playing instruments like those from nearby Egypt or Assyria. The collections of the British Museum then, as now, offered a bewildering array of material and it was through publications, that many first learned of its riches and which then stimulated them to seek out objects in the Museum. Poynter must have done the same. He would have seen reproductions of Egyptian harps in such publications as John Gardiner Wilkinson\u2019s Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians (1837). This work proved enormously popular with a Victorian public keen to learn more about this most celebrated ancient civilization. It was published in several editions, the most popular being that of 1878 and for historical painters in particular it became an essential manual. Coloured paper was a favourite of Poynter and many drawings related to the painting were drawn on this bright shade of terracotta. Appropriately one of these is in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and depicts two harpists playing side by side (as in the finished painting). The British Museum\u2019s sheet was donated by the painter\u2019s nephew Charles Francis Bell (1871-1966) in 1931 and is among the finest of Poynter\u2019s studies. The painter carefully kept his cherished drawings and, keenly aware of their importance as works of art in their own right, usually drew neatly (as here) on the sheet.
