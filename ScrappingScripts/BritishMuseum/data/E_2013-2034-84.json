{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.84"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on a sandstone rock face, showing top right: equid (horse) facing left, painted and infilled in brown and white bichrome with coat pattern markings, superimposed with white lines. Below the horse are two animals; the animal on the left is larger and faces right; that on the right is smaller and faces left. The smaller animal superimposes the larger with its head and part of its forelegs. The animals have naturalistic coat pattern markings of multiple brown oval spots on white infill, and short, white, u-shaped horns. The rump of the left hand animal is completely eroded. These animals appear to have short faint horns, but the body shape and patterning are more similar to serval (mythical?) To the right of this is further remains of widespread brown pigment but this is now so eroded that identification of the subject is impossible. A 10cm scale has been fitted at the bottom of the image. Magharat el-Kantara, Egypt.

It is the only known rock art site in the south-eastern part of Gilf Kebir. The cave and its cattle paintings were discovered by a member of an expedition led by W.B.K.
