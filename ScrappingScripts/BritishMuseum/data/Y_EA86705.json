{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86705"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with two small rows of basketry coil impression at the rear. At the side impressions of slightly bent curve of another coil of basketry, meaning that this sealing was positioned at the top of a basket. The fine red-brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles and was hardened after excavation. The top part shows one impression of a scarab-like seal, may salt incrustations inside at the edge. The seal consists of a small illegible cartouche with a thickened line next to it and two figures underneath, the one on the left kneeling in front of an offering stand or a standard, the figure on the right seated on a throne, seems to be the same seal as on EA86691, EA86693 and EA86713.
