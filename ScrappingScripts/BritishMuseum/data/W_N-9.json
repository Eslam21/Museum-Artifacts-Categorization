{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["115505"], "Description": [" Shallow copper alloy bowl: with gently curving sides and a slightly raised central part. Four pairs of winged falcon-headed sphinxes confront each other. The sphinxes wear aprons with projecting uraei and the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Each has a front paw raised and resting on the head of a human figure. Between the confronted sphinxes are papyrus columns, and above them winged sun-discs, while between each pair of sphinxes is a large papyrus column supporting a winged scarab beetle holding a sun-disc with double uraei. In the centre of the bowl is a floral motif surrounded by five friezes of lotus flowers. There are bands of a cable pattern above and below the sphinxes.

There is at least one other bowl from Nimrud with papyrus columns and sphinxes (Layard 1853a: pl. 68, top centre = N12), and two comparable examples from the Idaean Cave in Crete (Markoe 1985: 234-5, Cr 2-3). The 'marsh pattern' is quite common amongst the Nimrud bowls. The clearly Egyptian character of the motifs on this bowl indicates that it was made in a workshop much influenced by Egyptian taste, probably in Phoenicia. Bibliography: A. H.
