{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1837,0717.162"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of dwarf-like male celebrant. A bearded dwarf standing on a plain-faced plinth, leaning with his right hand on a sealed amphora on a wooden stand. He wears a short skirt-like garment from which his phallus emerges to touch the ground. His right leg is raised to rest his foot on the glans of the phallus; his left arm is akimbo with his hand on his waist. The navel protrudes. He is balding (a line of hair is shown in a summary manner round the back of his head) and wears a garland across his head above his brow, with a bloom below it on each side above his ears; a ribbon holds lotus buds to the top of his head. There is very little modelling at the back, which is pierced by a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt. There are remains of a thick white dressing, mainly on the front; traces of red paint on the left wrist and left foot.
