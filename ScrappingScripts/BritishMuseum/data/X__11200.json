"], "Materials": ["marble"], "Technique": [" carved ", " relief "], "Curator's comments": ["This funerary stela is so far only known from a photograph by Petrie (Petrie Delta Series no. 401; EES Archives) with the legend \"Marble near sunlight indoors\" (Petrie Notebook 23). The piece was probably imported from Attica (or another Greek region where Athenian-style tombstones were produced) in the 4th century BC. It is very unusual to find such tombstones in Egypt (see Grimm 2010). The findspot of the relief is unclear. Gardner lists the piece together with another relief (the funerary banqute scene) as \u2018found last year\u2019 but not within \u2018the limits of the ancient city\u2019 (Gardner 1888: 22). If this is the \"a slab of sculpture from an early tomb; of three figures, of no interest\" that Perie in his journal (Petrie 1884-1885, p. 49) mentions as being among some 'antikas' he saw at the nearby town of Teh el Barud then its Naukratite findspot would be hyptothetical. The piece is not listed in Clairmont 1993 nor Clairmont 1995. Clairmont, C. W. 1993. Classical Attic Tombstones, Kilchberg. Clairmont, C. W. 1995. Classical Attic Tombstones.
