Over this is a large collar, coloured blue, green, red and yellow. The arms are crossed and the hands are shown protruding through the lower rows of the collar\u2014a graphic peculiarity which also appears on mummiform coffins in the 19th and 20th Dynasties. The painter seems to have decided not to try to superimpose agricultural tools on the polychrome collar, where perhaps they would have lacked clarity. Instead, he left the hands empty and painted the two hoes on the back of the figure, where they appear \"floating\" rather incongruously on each side of a large yellow grain basket hanging on cords. The design of the figure was completed by a single line of inscription on the front, introducing the name of the owner as 'sehedj' and adding the opening words of the shabti spell without detailing any of the specific tasks that the figure was required to perform.
