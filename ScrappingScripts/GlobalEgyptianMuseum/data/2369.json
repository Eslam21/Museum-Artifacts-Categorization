{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1908:516", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Height": "12 cm", "Width": "14 cm", "Depth": "6 cm", "Name": "Relief with the head of a princess", "Description": "The style of this delicate relief is Ramesside. It may come from a depiction of a princess in a series of sons and daughters of the royal family making offerings. Such scenes are well-attested from the 19th Dynasty and from the 20th Dynasty on temple walls. The object in the woman's hand can barely be discerned on the left, but parallels suggest that this was a sistrum, the metal rattle shaken by chantresses in the cult. In this instance the recipient might be either the king, perhaps Ramses II, or the god Ptah, patron of the city where the block was found, Memphis (modern Mit Rahina)."}
