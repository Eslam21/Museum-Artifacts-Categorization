It possibly belongs to a figure of Osiris since Osiris bronzes were common in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). The Osirian cult is important in the saite nome, and particularly in Sais itself as stressed by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 445), but also on a more local scale (Masson 2015). Several fittings made off copper alloy were discovered in Naukratis: they consist mainly of elements of crowns, but also false beards. These fittings imply the presence of relatively large statues of Egyptian deities (Masson forthcoming). For a more complete fitting of that type: Goddio and Fabre 2008, 149 and 322, No. 204.
