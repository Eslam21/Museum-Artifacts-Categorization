{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86166"], "Description": [" Scarab made of steatite, only small parts of base and legs chipped of. The greyish glaze is only preserved at the highest part of the back as well as parts of the base, underneath the beige colour of the steatite is visible. The division between head and prothorax is shown by a line that is not fully consistent. Elytra and prothorax are divided by a small notch at the outer ends, no line though. The same is true for the suture, no humeral callosities as well. The head is very stylized in an almost triangular shape, eyes might be indicated by a small groove, the clypeus is broken off, small lobes indicated by an outline as well. The side shows two horizontal lines, the upper one is not consistent in the middle part where the legs are attached to the body. Here a third groove is incised vertically on one side, slightly askew on the other side. The second line is consistent and separates the scarab from its base plate. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, the outer ends both show antithetical nb-baskets, leaving an inner area that is filled with hieroglyphs: a mn-sign above a horizontal line (n), underneath a sun-disc and two very little askew but almost vertical lines (like Gardiner Z4). Perforated along its longitudinal side.
