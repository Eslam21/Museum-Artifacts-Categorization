A man or child reclining on a plain rectangular plinth, modelled in the round, his legs extended to his right, the left leg on the ground, the right knee raised. His physique is rather flabby and child like, as is common with Harpocrates representations. He rests his left arm on a block and his right hand on the root of his large phallus, the glans of which lies between his feet. He wears a short chlamys, the ends round his throat and falling behind him. Solid; two-piece mould, with cut-out made subsequent to moulding , between the figure\u2019s left side, his left arm and the block. Orange to light-brown marl clay with some mica. Traces of a white dressing. The flesh is painted pink, and the areas between the body and the right arm and between the right leg and the phallus are painted red; red paint remains also on the left elbow just above the block.

Similar reclining Harpocrates figures were made of faience, found in a third century BC context at Athribis (Szyma\u0144ska 1999b, 73, fig. 2) and also found at Naukratis (British museum GR1886,0401.1495) and Karnak (Masson pers. com).
