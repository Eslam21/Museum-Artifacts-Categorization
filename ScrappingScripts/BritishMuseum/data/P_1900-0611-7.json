Entry from Martin Royalton-Kisch, \u2018Catalogue of drawings by Rembrandt and his school\u2019, 2010, Rembrandt, cat. no.11. One of three drawings (Benesch 443-5) by Rembrandt based on early reproductions of Leonardo da Vinci's fresco of the 'Last Supper' in S. Maria delle Grazie, Milan. The influence of the composition is felt repeatedly in Rembrandt's own work, including the painting in Dresden of 'Samson' posing the Riddle to the Wedding Guests', dated 1638 (Bredius 507, Corpus A123), the 'One Hundred Guilder Print' of the 1640s (Bartsch 74, Hind 236), the etching of the 'Supper at Emmaus', dated 1654 (Bartsch 87, Hind 282), the painting of the 'Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis' of c.1661 (Bredius 482, Stockholm) and perhaps even the 'Syndics of the Drapers' Guild' of 1662 in Amsterdam (Bredius 415).[1] The first of the three drawings by Rembrandt is that in New York (Benesch 443), which like the present sheet is executed in red chalk and signed. It shows the whole composition and includes a dog at the lower right, a motif uniquely found in an anonymous early Milanese engraving, which must have been Rembrandt's model.[2] Over a light sketch, in which the background and minor details of the figures already deviate from the engraving, Rembrandt went over the New York drawing in a heavier style, changing and emphasising various parts, in particular making Christ's pose more erect and introducing a curtained 'baldacchino' above him. The New York study was followed by the British Museum's, which also underwent considerable changes as work progressed. Although initially inspired in part by the New York version, it is clear that for the present sheet Rembrandt employed a different model, a drawing now at Chatsworth by Pieter Soutman (or a now unknown version of it).[3] Soutman's drawing formed the basis of an engraving, in reverse, the inscription on which shows that it is based on a reinterpretation of Leonardo's composition by Peter Paul Rubens (Schneevoogt 231). The print was made in two plates, the right section of which corresponds with the detail shown in the Chatsworth drawing. This detail also corresponds with that treated by Rembrandt in the British Museum's sheet, in which Christ's shoulder is cut off at the same point. The Soutman and Rubens version of the composition also includes a diagonal stretch of drapery behind the group of apostles adjacent to Christ. These features leave no doubt that Rembrandt employed it as his starting-point. As in the New York drawing, Rembrandt began work on the present sheet by lightly indicating the outlines of the figures. In general these outlines replicate those in Soutman's drawing, and traces of the features that were later modified, such as the apostle with raised hands (St Andrew) and the hand extended behind his left shoulder, remain visible. Yet this central area of the drawing, as well as the part occupied by the left-hand figure (St James), were erased with a thin layer of white heightening (which has become transparent with time). The application of the white appears to have been the preliminary stage in a more general reworking of the sheet that led to several important changes to the basic layout. While the group next to Christ was reinforced, with only one significant alteration \u2013 the sharper angle of Judas' elbow \u2013 the group on the left was changed radically. The central of the three heads now visible originally belonged to the apostle on the left of Soutman's drawing (St James). Over this figure, after covering a considerable part of it in white, Rembrandt drew the seated apostle nearest the spectator. After being similarly treated with white, the apostle with raised hands (St Andrew) was entirely recast, being turned away from Christ with his hands lowered, a change which erased almost all traces of the figure as seen in Soutman's drawing. In Rembrandt's third study, that at Berlin (Benesch 445), which like the New York drawing shows the whole composition, this replacement figure was repeated, albeit with only one apostle remaining to his right. The other was moved to close the gap that had emerged between the two groups in the British Museum's sketch. The group of three apostles next to Christ is repeated with little change, although Judas' head is raised slightly, so that it corresponds, more or less, to its position in Rembrandt's two models. While it has been suggested that further drawings after Leonardo's 'Last Supper' may have been made by Rembrandt,[4] the logical sequence of development in the three that survive argues that they were made at the same time, i.e. in 1635, when the Berlin drawing was signed and dated. A later, school drawing in Berlin, probably made in the 1660s, is also based on Leonardo's composition.[5] Finally, it is worth remarking that, unusually for Rembrandt, all three drawings are signed, as also is his copy in black chalk of Pieter Lastman's painting in Dublin of 'Joseph distributing Corn in Egypt' (Vienna, Benesch 446, dated by him c.1637). Rembrandt's reasons for signing a higher proportion of his drawn copies than drawings of his own invention are obscure. Perhaps he wished to prevent their attribution to the masters he was copying.
