His shaved head indicates that he may have been a priest. The artist expressed the transparency of the top of his garment by showing the muscles of the chest and the navel. The eyes are outlined in black. There are two thin lines of black paint relief for the eyebrows. The man rests the palm of his right hand on his kilt. The artist gives life to the statue by moving the left foot a little forward. The blank space on the base would presumably having text asking for offerings for the Ka of the deceased and also the name and the titles of the owner."}
