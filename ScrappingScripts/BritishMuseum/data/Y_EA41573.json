{"artifact_name": "model group; figure", "Object Type": [" model group ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["EA41573"], "Description": [" Wooden funerary model of a granary: made of painted wood and grain, comprising a granary and five figures, from the tomb of the official Sebekhotep. The model building has a doorway painted red and yellow; a ladder leads between two levels (its original position is not certain). The granary is filled with grain and juniper berries. Workmen on the lower level handle grain, one of them carrying a sack. A scribe sits on the upper level recording on a writing board the amounts of grain being stored or issued; a representation of his palette is painted onto the writing board beside his hand. Beside him sits a figure apparently directing the workmen below. There are hieratic jottings on the walls.
