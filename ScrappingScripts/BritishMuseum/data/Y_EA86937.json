{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86937"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The fragment is blackened due to fire. On the rear on one side two coils of basketry, on the second side another coil of basketry suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front is slightly convex and shows one impression of a complete scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal shows a seated falcon in the upper left part, facing towards the left. Behind it a small cartouche, difficult to read, probably (Mn-kheper-R')|. The cartouche is not in the axis of the seal but askew following the outline of the rear of the falcon. Further to the right a lizard (I1) with its head pointing downwards. Underneath these three signs a standing lion (E22), facing towards the left, standing on top of another object that is bend like the end of the seal, a boat? The same motif can be found on EA86938.
