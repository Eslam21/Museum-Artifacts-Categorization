", " Ithyphallic figurine, dated c. 525BC to c.330BC. One of numerous examples from, or probably from, Naukratis (Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1836; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA599; British Museum 1973,0501.18, 1973,0501.12, 1973,0501.30, 1973,0501.21; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum E.119.1914, E.98.1914; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.386). A similar hand-made ithyphallic Harpocrates figure was found in a 5th century BC Persian period deposit at the bottom of a well (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4653It; Hogarth 1905, 125; Hogarth 1903 Diary April 24th and 25th, well 2 bottom). Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum, UC48351, see also similar UC49892-3, but uncertain subject). The upper body fragments are identical to contemporary hand-made Persian rider figures from Naukratis and fragments can be hard to distinguish (see British Museum, 1886,0401.1468). Labelled \"Well 2 bottom\". 'The well very barren, & has about come to an end. One squatting indecent terracotta, but without head or end of penis. Full of water each morning & not worth while' (Hogarth Diary Saturday April 25th.) 'The well (no. 2) not much use. Several poor class pots \u2013 nothing as yet good. Shall try no more hereabouts' (Hogarth Diary Friday April 24th). There also I have cleared out all ancient wells I could find; but in 1903 I got nothing from any of these, beside rough pottery, except a seated phallic terracotta, headless, and two stone horses and a stone 'sphinx' figure. (Hogarth 1905, 122). The contents of another well, excavated in 1903, are shown under Fig. 4. Nos. 1 and 3 are native types. Nos. 4 and 6 are typically Greek, but are made of ordinary Egyptian clay without any decoration. No. 5 is a black-glazed Greek vase. No. 7 on the other hand has a polished red surface. This well also seems not to have belonged to the pre-Persian town. It probably dates from the fifth century. (Hogarth 1905, 125).
