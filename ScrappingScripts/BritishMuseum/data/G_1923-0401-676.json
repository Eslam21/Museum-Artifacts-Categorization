{"artifact_name": "intaglio", "Object Type": ["intaglio"], "Museum number": ["1923,0401.676"], "Description": [" Blue glass intaglio with a portrait of Cleopatra VII. This pale blue glass gem shows a portrait of a royal woman, identified by the broad, knotted diadem. The hair is tied back in a bun in the usual Greek manner and the dress that the queen wears is also Greek in origin, with folds of drapery clearly visible. The headdress, however, is Egyptian in style and in the form of a triple uraeus; the cobras wear sun discs on their heads. The portrait features are relatively clear and show a full face, with straight nose and a strong chin with a downturned mouth.
