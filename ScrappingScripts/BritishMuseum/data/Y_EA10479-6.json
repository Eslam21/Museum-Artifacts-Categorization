{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10479,6"], "Description": [" 'Book of the Dead', Papyrus of Hor (sheet 6): Judgment Scene: to the left of the scene sits Osiris, with the goddesses Isis and Nephthys standing behind him. Osiris wears an 'atef ' crown with the horns of the ram god Khnum, from whom they had been more or less inadvertently appropriated. His face is green, and he holds his identifying crook and flail. As so often in Ptolemaic and Roman Period representations of Osiris, his shroud is coloured red. The weighing of the heart is carried out here by two gods, Anubis and Horus. Hor's heart is in the pan to the left; but in the right-hand pan, where we would expect to see the feather of Maat, is instead a tiny seated figure coloured black. The crossbar of the balance hangs from a feather-shaped peg attached to the upright support, on the top of which squats a small baboon. This creature is a form of the god Thoth, who acts in a different form and with a different duty elsewhere in this \"trial\". To the left of the balance stands Thoth, here in human form with ibis head; he is the scribe of the gods, and he holds a scribe's palette and a reed brush, ready to note down the results of Hor's interrogation. In front of Thoth sits a monster ready to spring forward to consume Hor's heart if he fails to pass the test. This creature has the head of a hippopotamus, and the body of a lion. At the top of the scene the great gods of Egypt are shown, formally seated on thrones, waiting to deliver judgment. There are thrity-five in total. Each holds a feather of Maat. Maat herself is present too - not as a feather in the balance, and not as a woman with a feather on her head, but literally as a feather head. There is also well-drawn details of the crocodile at the top left of the papyrus.
