This miniature scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B1-12, especially B1 and B4 for this piece: recorded twice in Gorton typology, once with its registration number and once with the drawing number of Petrie). Petrie illustrated variants of this association of an animal - often a falcon or a mythical creature - with a debased hieroglyphic inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, no. 71-78). The hieroglyphs, as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93). Menkheperra, though corresponding to the royal name of Thutmosis III, was also a popular motto on scarabs and scaraboids (Jaeger 1982). Gorton, A.
