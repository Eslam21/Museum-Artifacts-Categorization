Outline roughly trapezoidal, with an extension in one corner. Fringes of two types, on two adjacent edges, the edge with the longer fringe being a selvedge. Remains of selvedge along edge opposite to the latter, selvedge also along inner edge of extension. Self-stripes of two thicknesses made by bunches of weft threads, some of stripes running right across the fragment - a series of 4 pyramid shapes formed by short self-stripes towards outer acute corner. Some simple weft picks also turning back on themselves, hence trapezoidal shaping.
