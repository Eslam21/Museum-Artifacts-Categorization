He wears a wig that reaches his shoulders and leaves his ears exposed. The statue is well modeled; the details of the man's body like those of his hands, legs and toes are clearly visible. The sistrum he is holding was particularly sacred to the goddess Hathor and was used to soothe her during festivals. The goddess was generally depicted as a decorative motif at the end of the handle and in this case her head and ears are visible and she is wearing a wig. The goddess wears the Modius on her head; it is in the form of a rectangular naos topped by a V-shaped molding and enclosed in two spirals from which a cobra looks out."}
