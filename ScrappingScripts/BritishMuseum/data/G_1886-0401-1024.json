Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, it does find parallels with his South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 5C or Type 9A. These cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups and coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18) and Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type A2 or B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.088) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.1024"], "Joined objects": [" Joined Object Group: G16639 (2 objects) "]}
