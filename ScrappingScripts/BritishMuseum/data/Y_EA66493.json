XVIII, 42; Gorton 1996, 104). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun or Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). H\u00f6lbl proposed to interpret this inscription as an abbreviated form for the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 71, pl. 83/1, no. 341). In other very similar inscriptions, the owl is replaced by a falcon and in these cases, H\u00f6lbl also proposed to translate the inscription as the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 165). This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 103-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B62; scaraboid interpreted as a Bes head, but is clearly black African head).
