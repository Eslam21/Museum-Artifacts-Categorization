XLV-LXX ; Pinch 1993, p. 143-146 ; Ziegler 1979, p. 31-62 ; Ziegler 1984). Naukratis provided several examples of sistra, in glazed composition like for this specimen, but also in copper alloy. Some of them can be dated to the 26th dynasty, supporting the practice of Egyptian cult activities in this period (Masson forthcoming; Yoyotte 1994-95, p. 674). This sistrum, with the rather triangular Hathor\u2019s head and papyrus stem decorating both sides of the wig, finds some parallels (for example: Ziegler 1979, p. 48, no. 45-47). This type is rarely well preserved \u2013 like here, only the head survived - which could pinpoint towards a rather fragile production (Ziegler 1979, p. 33). According to better preserved examples, it is a Naos-sistrum type. Based on comparison with well-dated close types, this series could belong to the Late Period (Ziegler 1979, p. 48).
