For a print by Pond after this drawing, see 1872,1012.4711; 1977,U.435-436; 1936,1116.2126.50; and 2006,U.1103-1104 (in reverse, dating this original drawing 1670). Within the sequence of Claude\u2019s Liber Veritatis, this drawing stands out for several reasons. It records the first of four ambitious paintings that Claude made for Henri van Hamale (for the others see LV160, 169 and 181). The present work (now in the Hermitage, inv. no. 1235; canvas, 113 x 156.5 cm; Roethlisberger 1986, no. 224) and LV160 forming a pendant even though they were commissioned at different points in time. The drawing itself bears witness to Claude\u2019s increasingly grand conception of space and competent integration of figures within a scene. It is also notable for its high level of finish as in the subtle layers of wash, fine penwork and touches of gold on the figures. This attention to detail is reflected in the two preparatory drawings for the landscape, one of which is in the BM (see inv. no. 1895,0915.901; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 853) and the other in the Boijmans (inv. no. F.I. 120; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 854). That Claude deemed this composition to be a success is reflected by the fact that he repeated this composition in an upright format in LV158, as well as in R 857 (for which see BM inv. no. Oo,7.135) and two later drawings from 1667/68 and 1670 (Roethlisberger 1968, nos. 972 and 1014). He also made another highly finished drawing of the composition in 1659, and hence prior to the completion of the painting, which further suggests his satisfaction with the scene (now in the Albertina, inv. no. 11,501; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 856).
