", " The letters AP and P, painted in red and associated with the object number, appear on many Boston objects, but do not correspond to provenance information. Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Scaraboids in the shape of a Black African head are a standard production at Naukratis. This specimen is a plainer version of a Black African head compared with those listed by Petrie (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 8-11), where hair is indicated by lines, cross hatching or braiding.
