{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 2609", "Dating": "TAO II/SEQENENRE", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Mummy of Seqnenre-Taa the Second", "Description": "King Seqnenre-Taa the Second's mummy was originally buried at Dra-Abu'l Naga, and later reburied at Deir el-Bahari in his original coffin. The body of this king, who died in his forties, was poorly preserved. However, the brain is still in the cranial cavity and the mummy's mouth still has a complete set of healthy teeth. The king's head is covered with horrific wounds: a dagger thrust behind the ear, after which, perhaps, blows rained down upon him. Mace blows smashed his cheek and nose and a battle-axe cut through the bone above his forehead."}
