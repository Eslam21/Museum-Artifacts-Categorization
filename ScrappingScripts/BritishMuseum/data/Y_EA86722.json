{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86722"], "Description": [" Very small fragment of a seal-impression, the rear shows impressions of either wood or other plants with a possible part originating from textile. Above this the impression of a turned string is visible. The dark brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica and was hardened after excavation. The top part is rounded and shows an almost complete and very small impression of a scarab-like seal as well as the edge of another impression that probably originates from another seal. Between them many finger prints are visible. The almost complete seal shows a standing human figure with an apron on the right, facing to the left, both arms erected as if it was carrying or offering something. In front of it at the ground further signs that look like a very small seated deity. Underneath either two lines or a nb-basket with inner lines. The second impression shows a horizontal line and a bent line.
