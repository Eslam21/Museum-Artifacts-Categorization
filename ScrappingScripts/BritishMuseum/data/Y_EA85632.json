{"artifact_name": "tool/implement", "Object Type": ["tool/implement"], "Museum number": ["EA85632"], "Description": [" Conical tool, made of a very dark brown clay, possible discolouration due to applied substances to harden the clay after excavation. The object is conical with several flattened and well smoothed faces from bringing the object in shape. The top is quite eroded by now, the drawing on the object card shows still a more pointed top. The base is roughly flat but quite eroded and parts being chipped off. Across the surface runs a groove that looks like the object was (secondary?) used for wedging. One of the flattened parts on the curved surface shows a decoration in form of a longer vertical line with several small lines perpendicular to the longer one running of to the right. The drawing of the object card shows a second vertical line on the right end side which is not visible on the object. The surface here is only very little eroded, it seems unlikely that the entire line has disappeared. Also the second band of decoration that was drawn is not visible on the object, although two horizontal lines are recognisable that seem to be remains of voids from burnt chaff rather than decoration.
