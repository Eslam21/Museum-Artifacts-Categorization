{"artifact_name": "figure(?)", "Object Type": ["figure (?)"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.7"], "Description": [" Terracotta grotesque head; part of figure(?). A grotesque male face broken from a figure: the eyes are deeply sunken under heavy brows, the nose is crooked and the cheeks prominent, and the mouth is large; there is a short pointed beard, and the hair is brushed forward over the brow. The object was mould-made and a strip of unknown use, now broken, was applied diagonally across the top of the head. This may be a lower escutcheon from the handle of a jug. Dark-brown clay, apparently with little mica, with a black slip, perhaps of Memphis Black Ware.
