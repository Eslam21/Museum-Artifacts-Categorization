The Sirens Painter's pieces most closely resemble those by the Boreads Painter, primarily because of the single pomegranate band on the tondo of the Oxford kylix. Lemos identifies the sherd as belonging in the Sphinx and Lion Style but that is unlikely. There are very few drinking vessels in that style and lions and sphinxes are stylistically different.
