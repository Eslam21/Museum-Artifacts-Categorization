{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA43043"], "Description": [" Naophorous limestone figure of Padiaset, shown kneeling before a naos with a figure of Osiris. The figure wears a smooth \u2018bag wig\u2019 which reaches to the shoulders and is tucked behind the ears. His eyes are small and almond shaped, with a faint ridge above conveying the eyebrows. His nose is extremely broad, and his mouth is small with thick lips. The face is fleshy and rounded at the mouth, jawline and neck. A deep \u2018v\u2019 shape across the collarbone area possibly indicates the edges of his clothing, though there are no further indications of his garment at the waist or legs. His hands are placed around the sides of the naos which is held out before him, and his knees are also placed on either side of the naos. The naos is broad in size, and inside is the standing figure of the god Osiris. He is identifiable via the atef-crown, his mummiform figure, and the crook and flail implements held across his chest. His facial features are faint, but the outline of his eyes and false beard are discernible. On the reverse behind Padiaset is a slim back-pillar that reaches to the ends of his wig, which is inscribed with a column of text. The lower portion of the text is now damaged. Much of the statue base at the reverse and right side has been lost, and the top corners of the naos are also damaged. There are further small chips to the wig and body of Padiaset, and there are small chips to the back-pillar inscription which obscures some of the hieroglyphs.
