A glove would be in the shape of the hand and have five fingers like this one, or two fingers like another one that was found belonging to the same king in his tomb. Most probably, gloves in ancient Egypt were not used to keep the hands warm, as in cold countries, but were worn for horse riding, so were made of linen and not of wool. Linen was the national textile in Egypt and the figures for the flax harvest were shown on the tomb's walls beside those for the corn harvest."}
