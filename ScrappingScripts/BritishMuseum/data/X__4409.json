", " This ceremonial staff originated from a bronzes\u2019 cache found in a building located in the southern part of the city (on this cache: Petrie 1886, 41-42). This cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC, but could contain material of earlier date (Masson 2015). This bronze votive belongs to the type T 12a in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 276, 725, Pl. 42a/b, Typ T 12a, esp. Nr. 739 for this specimen). A parallel is known from the falcon catacomb in North Saqqrah (Davies, Smith 2005, 108, pl. LVI c). It could have served in the frame of processions or it could just be a model.
