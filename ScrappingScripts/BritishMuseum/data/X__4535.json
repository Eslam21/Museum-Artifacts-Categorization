", " Lion scaraboids belong to a common series produced at Naukratis (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). Moulds to produce lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1896,0610.16 and BM 1896,0610.17. Numerous couchant lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis (see for example the ones illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos. 50, 64, 69, 80, 92, 99, 104). The underside of lion scaraboids usually bears possibly the name of Amun-Ra, written in a cryptic way, or an imitation of a royal name. This scaraboid belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B63-67, see especially B64 for this piece). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is either a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun / Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). The lion shape of the scaraboid itself can be associated with solar deties. Lions were used to write the name of Ra during the Late Period, as the lion is a phonetic equivalent Rw (De Wit 1951, 138ff). The inscription could also be an imitation of the Horus name of Psamtek II, asssociated with a Maat feather, since such type is known on other Naukratite scarabs (Gorton 1996, 93). The hieroglyphs however are very difficult to read. De Wit, C. 1951, Le r\u00f4le et le sens du lion dans l\u2019Egypte ancienne, Leiden.
