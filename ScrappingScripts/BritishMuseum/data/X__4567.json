", " The owl sign is often associated on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids with solar symbols (see example of an owl between an obelisk and sun-disc in Gorton 1996, 103, no. 84) or other sacred signs (Maat feather, ankh sign: Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 42; Gorton 1996, 104). Though the hieroglyphic signs have often just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun-Ra. This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 103-107, type XXVIII B, see especially 71-88 for this piece).
