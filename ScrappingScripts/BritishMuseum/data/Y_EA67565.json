{"artifact_name": "tool/implement", "Object Type": ["tool/implement"], "Museum number": ["EA67565"], "Description": [" A long-handled cutting tool of uncertain use: the cutting edges are on either side of the pointed tip, and only extend for about 5.0cm from the point up the length of the tool. Above the sharpened edges, the tool narrows, and then tapers gradually to a slightly convex butt. The edges of the metal all along the stem are rounded off smoothly, probably indicating that this part served as a handle, especially as the tool seems never to have been equipped with a separate handle of wood. The cutting edges have been ground sharp from both sides.
