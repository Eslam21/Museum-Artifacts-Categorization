Both cartouches read from right to left. The left one gives the nomen of the king (Amasis, son of Neith), the first sign on the top being lost. The right cartouche, is slightly longer and gives the praenomen of the king (Khnemibra); only its left half is preserved. The standard of Min is carved under the left cartouche. Part of another sign or decoration, maybe similar, is visible under the other cartouche. A round sign or part of decoration (top of a figure?) is also visible further down.
