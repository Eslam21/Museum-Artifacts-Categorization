{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA76417"], "Description": [" Unsealed frame containing numerous fragments of papyrus inscribed with spells from the Book of the Dead with monochrome vignettes set within hieratic text in black and red ink. Variations in graphic technique and in the orientation of the papyrus fibres suggest that the fragments may have belonged to more than one manuscript. Parts of the text and/or vignettes of the following spells can be recognised: 31, 32, 37, 39, 41, 42 (?), 45, 53, 63B, 75, 78, 83, 88, 94, 103 (?) and 125. The largest number of joining fragments show the upper part of the vignette of spell 125, which appears to include the beginning of the name of the deceased, Ir.... A few fragments have text on the verso. The fragments are laid on paper, unattached to the glass. A label reads 'Checked Nov 80'; the frame and mounting is identical to 76416. A label states 'from Disposal Cupboard'.
