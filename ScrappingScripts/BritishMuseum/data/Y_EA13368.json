{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA13368"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone seated figure of the male official Renseneb. He wears a long kilt that extends down to the ankles. His left hand is placed flat on his lap, and his damaged right hand clearly held a piece of folded cloth which is still visible along his thigh. Traces of red-brown paint to denote his skin are visible on his right hand and feet. On either side of the seat are four slim columns of incised text, with traces of dark blue and white paint in the hieroglyph signs. The border lines of the text also bear faint traces of red paint. On the reverse are a further three slim columns of incised text with the beginning of each line now lost. Traces of dark blue paint are particularly notable in these three columns on the back of the seat. In addition to the loss of the upper body, there are numerous chips to the stone surface across the edges of the seat and top of the base. A number of further marks are visible on the clothing and right forearm of the figure. The object is attached to a modern rectangular base.
