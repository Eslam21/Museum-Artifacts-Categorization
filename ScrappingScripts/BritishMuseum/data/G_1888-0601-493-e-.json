The main vase from this group is a chalice in St. Petersburg from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which has the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Chalice Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily, and carelessly, in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Chalice Style group display a mixture of techniques, which consists of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black-figure. However, none of these features is visible on British Museum 1888,0601.493.e. Whilst most of what is visible of the female figure is her chiton, it is not depicted in outline (but her feet are, as female figures are depicted on Grand Style vases). Lemos mentions two other sherds she identifies as in the Chalice Style and depicting Athena (Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.85.1894 and Leiden N 3) but there are no features depicted on either of these sherds that are specific to Athena. The interior decoration on the vase is also not typical of the Chalice Style, but rather particular to the Aphaia Painter and group, named after the chalice found in the sanctuary of Aphaia on Aegina. Vessels from this group display a thematic unity, with figures in garments and particular treatment of the lower parts of chitons and himatia. None of the vessels in this group have any filling ornament and the interior decoration of some of the vessels consists of komasts rendered in light-on-dark technique. As a possible representation of Athena (for parallels with another Athena see Lemos no. 684 from Emporio), the sherd would not fit into the Chalice Style since deities are not depicted in this style. They, and other mythological figures, are portrayed on the earlier Grand Style vases. Because of the figural interior and exterior decoration, 1888,0601.493.e would be more appropriately placed within the Grand Style and possibly a product of the Aphaia Painter or Aphaia Group. For parallels, see British Museum 1888,0601.493.h and 1888,0601.493.i.
