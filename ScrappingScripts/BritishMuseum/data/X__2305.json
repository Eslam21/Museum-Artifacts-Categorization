This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This piece could correspond to the \"two snakes\" element that Petrie listed in the finds from the cache of bronzes (on this cache: Petrie 1886, 41-42; Masson 2015). Two other pairs of uraei however were discovered in the same season by Petrie: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H1072.1 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.298. The identification of its context of discovery is therefore not certain. Such fittings imply the presence of a relatively large statue of an Egyptian deity (maybe Osiris?). Other fragments belonging to one or more relatively large statues with glass inlays were discovered in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). Fittings in the shape of uraeus (single or pair) in copper alloy found in the Delta are listed in Weiss 2012, 876-880. Very close parallel for this double-uraeus from Herakleion (Weiss 2012, 876, Pl. 69, Nr 1364; see also Weiss 2012, 953, Nr. 1730 for this specimen).
