The Horus name, prenomen and nomen of the same king are written in two texts along three sides of the brick. The text on the fourth side of the brick is now illegible, but it probably contained the prenomen and nomen of the king with epithets. The brick is chipped at two corners and badly worn along two sides which are now largely illegible. The glazed composition is light green.
