The blade was made of thin sheet metal. It has a straight butt, lightly incurved sides, and a moderately convex cutting edge. The butt is considerably wider than the cutting edge. The lugs are angular and the corners of the cutting edge rounded. The blade is lightly corroded in parts. Chased on one face is a hieroglyphic inscription. The haft is curved, with a concave back. It is varied in section, being roughly cylindrical towards the bottom, ovoid in the middle, and faceted at the top. It tapers in width somewhat unevenly from top to bottom, with the butt-end being sharply expanded to facilitate grip. The socket at the top consists of a crudely worked shallow slit. An abortive socket appears to have been begun on the other side. The surface of the haft is much abraded. A small section only survives of the leather thong which once bound the blade to the haft. The wood is discoloured where the binding has left its mark.
