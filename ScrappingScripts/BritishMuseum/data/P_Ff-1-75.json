According to the artist's 'Giornale' (Puppi, 1968, pp. 102-3), Pietro Paolo Pancera commissioned the painting for a church in Cologna. The half-length figure at the lower right is a portrait of the patron's father Gianantonio. The painting is close to the drawing differing in only minor details, such as the addition of a cross held in Saint Diego's right hand. The present drawing may be the one mentioned in the artist's 'Giornale'. Lit: M. Piacentini, 'Dipinti e disegni italiani in Atene', \"L'Arte\", 1942, p. 18, fig. 11; L.
