{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1006.12"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Harpokrates in chariot. Harpokrates standing in a chariot looking over its right side. He wears a chiton with short sleeves and a closely woven and bound wreath from which the curls that frame his face emerge; he may have had a Double Crown, but a scar at the top of his head is not very emphatic. His hand is to his mouth and he holds his pot to his left side. The chariot is schematically rendered, with a side frame only shown, and a top segment of its four-spoked wheel. The back is plain. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt.
