{"artifact_name": "lantern", "Object Type": ["lantern"], "Museum number": ["1996,0712.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta lantern; seated male slave figure on top. A miniature lantern modelled as a tholos with a rectangular doorway at the back (for the insertion of the lamp), and a lattice-barred window at the front. Columns are placed on each side and four small elliptical holes are cut through the walls. The building rises from a moulded base and is crowned with dentils and mouldings, above which is a conical roof through which trefoil-shaped smoke-holes are cut. The lantern stands on three feet. Seated on the roof is a boy wearing a short tunic and holding with both hands a lamp in his lap. Very summary treatment at the rear of the figure; pierced suspension-lug with a serrated edge placed behind the neck. Hollow; two-piece mould; applied circular floor and feet. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with an overall dull red slip. Yellow paint survives on the dentils, the door-jambs, and the mouldings at the base.
