{"artifact_name": "panel; stela", "Object Type": [" panel ", " stela "], "Museum number": ["EA1242"], "Description": [" Limestone panel of Rahotep: from the false door in the tomb of Rahotep. The deceased is shown seated on a simple, bull-legged, backless chair, one hand clasped on his chest and the other extended towards an offering-table carrying half-loaves of bread. The names of conventional offerings are written above the table and below it to one side of the stand. To the right of this scene is a standard offering-list of the early type. The name and titles of the deceased are written in larger signs on both sides of and above the main scene. The lower right-hand corner has been broken away from the main panel (now plastered back into position). The disappearance of almost all colour has revealed the full quality of the fine relief, in particular the details of the hieroglyphs. There are traces of black on the wig, of a yellowish brown on the flesh of the figure and on some of the hieroglyphs in the top line. Originally Rahotep was represented wearing a long leopard-skin garment.
