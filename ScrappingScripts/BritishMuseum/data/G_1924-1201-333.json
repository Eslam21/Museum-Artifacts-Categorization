The decoration on British Museum 1924,1201.484, consisting of a metopal decoration in the form of the large maeander, is typical of the Wild Goat Style. However, the presence of interior decoration, which is not found on Wild Goat Style vases, suggests that the sherd is possibly late in that style and marks the transition to the Mature Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
