Almost no decoration on the back, but on the left side one short horizontal line, two on the right side, probably indicating the division between prothorax and elytra. No head and eyes visible but two triangular areas which are probably the plates are visible. On the lower part of the back a nb-shaped hole in the middle with two lines running up to the top. Rubbed off at the highest part of the back, underneath grey coloured frit visible. The side shows only one incised line separating it into base and upper part, no legs indicated. The lines are not running completely around the object. The seal at the base does not show a circumferential line. Three hieroglyphic signs visible: In the upper part, left an uraeus, facing to the right, where a sun disc is visible. Underneath maybe the shield of Neith (R24) horizontally. Perforated along its longitudinal side.
