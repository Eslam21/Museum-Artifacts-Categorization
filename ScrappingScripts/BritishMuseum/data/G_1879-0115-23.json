{"artifact_name": "plaque; coffin-fitting", "Object Type": [" plaque ", " coffin-fitting "], "Museum number": ["1879,0115.23"], "Description": [" Terracotta relief plaque (coffin decoration) of a Medusa's head. A coffin-attachment of a mask of Medusa, with small wings (broken) in her hair at the top of her head, and snakes tied under her chin. The concave back has a flattened edge with traces of the plaster by which it was attached to the coffin, and a central vertical ridge, mainly of plaster, also for attaching it. A patch of restoration in plaster is found on both edges of the hair. Pressed into a one-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with white inclusions. The face and snakes were covered with a white dressing, but the hair does not seem to have been so covered. There are traces of red paint on the face, surviving mainly on the nose, the chin, the mouth and round the eyes. The eyes are blue, outlined in black, with pink paint above them and with red tear-ducts. A black line divides the lips. The hair is painted yellow and the snakes blue. The break at the top and the flat edge at the back are painted red-brown, probably in antiquity, but perhaps by a modern restorer.
