{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA97"], "Description": [" Green siltstone head of a statue of a king: this royal head wears a 'nemes' with a uraeus, the hood of which was a separate piece, probably of gold or some other metal, which is now gone. Apart from the loss of its nose, which was further damaged by at least one attempt to repair it, the face is extremely well preserved. This face is mask-like. The king is possibly Ahmose II, now more probably Nectanebo I.
