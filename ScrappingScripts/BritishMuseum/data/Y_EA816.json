{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA816"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Amenemipet: there are two registers on this round-topped stela with incised texts and scenes in sunk relief. In the upper register Amenemipet, undoubtedly a necropolis-workman, stands in adoration on the right holding up an offering to Amun-Ra, Mut and the deified Amenhotep I who are enthroned on the left behind an altar heaped with offerings. The second register is badly damaged with only parts of four columns of text still extant. Only the upper part of this stela is preserved, and this is severely damaged along the upper edge. There is a thick black line along the edges of the stela possibly due to a mounting in the nineteenth century.
