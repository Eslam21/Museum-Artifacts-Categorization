", " The design of central twisted rope is particularly popular during the Second Intermediate Period (see examples from good contexts of the 13th-15th dynasty at Meggido, Jericho, Fara and especially Tell el-Ajjul: Tufnell 1984, 126, class 6C2, pl. XXVII; see also: Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 361, no. 874; Magnarini 2004, 189-190, nos. 06.07-06.08). Later archaising copies of such design, however, do exist. The collection in Bristol holds a series of early scarabs from Naukratis, often said to come from the Scarab Factory like here, and which were not illustrated in earlier publications. Petrie illustrated several other early examples of scarabs and scaraboids. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). The poor quality of the treatment of the back and legs could point towards an archaising copy. For a close motif on a stone scarab from Naukratis: Edinburgh, National Museum of Scotland A.1888.23 E.
