{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.5342", "Dating": "3RD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (not before); 26TH DYNASTY ?; LATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED; ENGRAVED; FAYENCE; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Height": "13 cm", "Name": "Shabti of Chechank", "Description": "The funerary statuette in blue faience seems to belong to the category of the \"Overseer\" (see E.3316), dressed in a kilt and holding a whip in its hand. These typological elements and the name of the owner (Chechanq) could indicate that the piece dates from the 22nd Dynasty. However, the fineness of the facial features, the form of the wig and the presence of the false beard prompt us to date the shabti to the 26th Dynasty."}
