", " Attempts have been made to explain the word after ni\u1e63f ('half') in various ways but to make the correction to d\u012bn\u0101r, as Fahm\u012b did, seems much the most satisfactory solution, bringing the legend into conformity with other types. The initial d\u0101l of d\u012bn\u0101r has been written w\u0101w and the next two letters run together into a m\u012bm. It would appear that this is to be explained as a partial dittography of \u2018wa amara\u2019 from line three, made easier because of the resemblance between that phrase and d\u012bn\u0101r in Kufic script. This is much the commonest of al- al-Q\u0101sim's half- d\u012bn\u0101r weight dies. As is often the case with coin weights with long legends, the date is too cramped to be really legible. It is presumably meant to be 119, the only legible date found on Muslim's glass pieces except for a single type of fals weight dated 121 (e.g. OA+ 4176).
