A number of similar examples from Naukratis are now in the British Museum (GR1886,0401.1468 and probably GR1973, 0501.18 previously thought to be a seated dwarf in Bailey 2008), the Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA599), Bristol Museum (H2223) and Bolton Museum (1966.93.A of unclear provenance). There are parallels in the Cairo Museum (Unprovenanced TR14/1/34/6=SR5/1849; CG32901=SR5/1835; and from Toukh el Karenis TR14/1/34/5=SR5/1744). Higgins supplies GR1886,0401.1468 with a specific mid 4th century BC date (Higgins 1954, 407) and suggests this was made in Naukratis. However the Persian rider parallels probably date from 525BC to 323BC (see British Museum GR1888,0601.90). The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta kiln products of this period. There are more complicated examples with a mould-made Persian style rider that are common at Naukratis (British Museum GR 1888,0601.90, Cairo SR5/ 966, CG 32804, Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA602, NA603, NA604), Tanis (Dunand 1990, 215-6, Cat. 583-592 and 594-595), Memphis (Cairo SR5/6260; Petrie 1909a, pl. 40. no. 42 , 45, 46; Petrie 1909b, pl. 29), Tell Basta (Cairo National Museum CG32810 SR5/967), Tukh el- Karamus (CG32806 JE35660 SR5/895), Deir el Bakari (CG32807 JE36203 SR5/896, CG32808 JE36203 SR5/897), Alexandria (Fischer 1994, nos 20-21) and without provenance (Cairo National Museum SR5/970 CG32907, ST5/969 CG32904, TR22/11/22/1 SR5/906, TR22/11/22/2 SR5/907, TR22/11/22/3 SR5/908, C32902 SR5/898).
