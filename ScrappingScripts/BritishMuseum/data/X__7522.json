", " When the stela was bought in Cairo in 1927, the provenance was lost. However, the mention in the text of Amun-Ra lord of Baded and of other \"great gods of Naukratis (Nay-Keredj)\" clearly indicates that it originated from Naukratis.This donation stela, dated to the year 3 of Ptolemy II or III [281/280 or 245/244 BC], is an unusual document since it is a demotic copy of a decree of evergetism made in honour of an individual benefactor, and not a king. Such practice was popular in Greek communities but not in Egypt. The local community of sheep breeders attached to the temples (wlt) made this decree in honour of a local individual, Sheamenope, who rendered services to this community and to the divine ram, hypostasis of Amun-Ra of Naukratis. Sheamenope was in charge of commercialising the wool from Milesian flock produced by the community of the wlt. The stela was probably placed in front of a building or a chapel related to the sacred rams.
