Hand-modelled from Nile silt clay, fired to orange-red, the figure represents a rearing cobra with flared hood, sat upon a flat support. The figure sits well upon an even surface. Three applied features have been added to the front of the figure, prior to firing: an offering stand/vessel (?) flanked by miniature cobras. The figure still bears traces of its original painted decoration, in white, yellow and black pigment. A section lost from under the head has been re-affixed; some repair-work at the back.

Being hand-modelled and made from readily available material, it is unsurprising that their form and scale vary enormously.
