Moulds to produce lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1896,0610.16 and BM 1896,0610.17. Numerous couchant lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis (see for example the ones illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos. 50, 654, 69, 80, 92, 99, 104). One of the lion scaraboids which has not yet been identified presents a falcon on the underside (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 50), thus this poorly preserved specimen could be that missing one: see in this catalogue 1886.XXXVII.50 for a full comment on that scaraboid. The underside of lion scaraboids usually bears possibly the name of Amun-Ra, written in a cryptic way (or less likely an imitation of a royal name). This scaraboid belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B63-67, maybe B63 for this piece). The lion shape of the scaraboid can be associated with solar deties. Lions were used to write the name of Ra during the Late Period, as the lion is a phonetic equivalent Rw (De Wit 1951, 138ff).
