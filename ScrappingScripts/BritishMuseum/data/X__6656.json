", " Original label records excavation year and the register records findspot. In addition to scarabs which were mass-produced especially for export, wedjat eyes, mainly in glazed composition but also in hard stone, form the main type of amulets found at Naukratis. Amulet with universal power of protection (Germond 2005, 25), the wedjat eye, simple or multiple, is one of the most common amulet on settlements of the Late Period (Masson forthcoming). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the McLean Museum & Art Gallery tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs and scaraboids moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. For similar types of wedjat eye found in Naukratis, see: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.805; London, Petrie Museum UC52354.
