{"artifact_name": "figure-mould", "Object Type": ["figure-mould"], "Museum number": ["EA38300"], "Description": [" A small circular terracotta bread-stamp, the grip at the rear broken away and lost. It has an incuse pattern: divided by a palm branch are two confronted cockerels standing on a baseline, each with a victory wreath above its back. Behind each bird is a pomegranate, and above their heads each has a bunch of grapes; two more bunches of grapes lie below the baseline. Pressed over a modelled form. Brown Nile silt. The face has been varnished in modern times to help release a cast of the impression.
