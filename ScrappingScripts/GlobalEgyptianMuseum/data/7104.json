Decoration for a chest?", "Description": "Six decorated polished bone tablets: five of them have oblique hatching on half of their width, the sixth bearing cross-hatching on all surfaces. They are perforated by two, three or four holes, which permit an interpretation as sliding mechanism. Identified as a fastening device for a bag, they would more likely have been inlay decorations on a trunk as exist at Kerma or on beds, as at Sai."}
