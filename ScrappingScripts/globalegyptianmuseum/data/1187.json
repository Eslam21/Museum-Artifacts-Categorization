The edge of the socle on which the animal is found is ornamented by an inscription which is very difficult to read. For the Egyptians, the hippopotamus was before all a manifestation of the negative forces which rule over the world. Therefore, the animal was dedicated to the god Seth the wicked. But the pachyderm has not always been considered as a harmful being. The female hippopotamus symbolised fecundity. She was worshipped under the names of \"the White\" and \"the Great\" and helped the mothers during the birth of gods, kings and mere mortals. The numerous amulets, figurines, statuettes, statues and representations on the walls of the tombs and of the temples bear witness to the great respect that the Egyptians had for this divinity embodying magical protection."}
