However, if it does belong with British Museum 1924,1201.555 then it would be more appropriately placed within the Mature Animal Style, since some of the filling ornament on 1924,1201.555 is inconsistent with the Chalice Style. Lemos places 1924,1201.555 within the Wild Goat Style, but the interior decoration is inconsistent with this early style. However, she may be describing a different sherd, as she mentions an incised inscription on its surface, of which there is no evidence on 1924,1201.555.
