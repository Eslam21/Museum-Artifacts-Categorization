Unfortunately this was found unregistered with the department of Greece and Rome in 1972. Limestone plaque of nude female standing in shrine or niche are similar to terracotta examples also found at Naukratis and Memphis. A small number of examples were found at Naukratis (British Museum EA1888,0601.21; 1886,0401.1506; Alexandria 16864; Heidelberg 1725). Like the reclining \u2018concubine\u2019 figures, these were found by Petrie and Hogarth in the town and adjacent to the Great Temenos area and broadly dated by the excavators to between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Hogarth 1905, 129, pl.19.4; Gutch in Hogarth 1899, 82 nos. 49- 56; Petrie 1886, 22, 36, 40-1, pl.19.2, 7-9) A Late Period parallel was found at Tell el-Yahudiya (Bailey 2008, 41; British Museum EA1875,0517.100) with papyrus-columns, broken lintel and Hathor capitals. Parallels from Saqqara (Quibbel 1907, pl.30.5), a Ptolemaic context in Tell Balamun (Spencer 2003, 35, no.16, pl.33.16), and from Athribis, including one wearing the crown of Isis-Hathor with Osiris, were found in contexts dated to the end of the 4th and the 2nd century BC (My\u015bliwiec 1996, 10, fig.2; 1997, 120; 2004, Figs 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, pl.3.1). See also Ptolemaic(?) parallel from Schedia (Abd El-Fattah 1998, 51-2, fig. 24). Broadly this type date to between the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. Abd El-Fattah, A. 1998.
