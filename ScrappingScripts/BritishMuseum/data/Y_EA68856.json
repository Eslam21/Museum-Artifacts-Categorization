That Bes was a very popular theme for containers of kohl and oil from New Kingdom onwards and into the 26th Dynasty is undoubted. They are so popular that they appear in a wide range of different styles and poses. Bes holding a libation (?) jar in front of him (Webb 1978, C1 Pl. II), which closely parallels Phase I vases -Webb's Leopard Spot Group; Bes holding a drum, (Friedman 1998. no. ); from the Greek world we have a steatite example from the Samian Heraion , no 73, and faience no 74 (Webb forthcoming); while there are other varieties from Samos, where the godlet is seated and holds in front of him the gazelle which he has captured, symbol of his victory over Seth, e.g. from a well-dated grave which also contained conventional faience aryballoi. Boehlau 1888, no. Webb 1978, 824 ; compare a cruder version, made by our workshops, Webb 1978, no 823. From the Greek world we have a steatite example from the Samian Heraion , no 73, and faience no 74 (Webb forthcoming)where Bes stands upright, and a much larger head only of Bes with a cavetto moulding above the head, (Diehl 1965, no ). The mimiature vessel now in Bonn, which claims Nuakratis as a findplace, is of sixth century type, but probably not found there. Clearly Bes can appear in a variety of poses, and is popular in the East Greek world of the sixth century, and therefore this little vase is not out of the ordinary. Closest parallels are from an early Ptolemaic production of the 3rd century BC of plastic vases in the form of Bes (Nenna and Seif el-Din, 2000, Pl.61, T10, nos. 424-431; Nenna 2013, 114, T10.2).
