{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:264", "Dating": "AMENEMHAT II/NEBUKAURE", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Height": "15 cm", "Width": "12.5 cm", "Name": "Lower part of a royal statue from Sinai", "Description": "Lower part of a roughly sculpted figure of a king seated on a block throne, with hieroglyphic inscription on the (figure's) left side of the throne identifying him as 'the son of Re Amenemhat, beloved of Hathor lady of turquoise(-land)', and on the right side as '... Nubkaura, beloved of Hathor lady of turquoise(-land)'. Nubkaura is the throne name of Amenemhat II, and this is the only surviving statue inscribed with that king's name. The figure is now much eroded, and the feet as well as the torso and head are missing, but the right lower arm appears to have lain flat on the lap. The figure was found by Flinders Petrie at the shrine of Hathor on the Sinai plateau at Sarabit el-Khadim."}
