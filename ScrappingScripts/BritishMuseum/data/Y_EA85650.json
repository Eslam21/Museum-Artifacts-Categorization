Unsmoothed and slightly irregular surface. At the underside in the base the impression of a scarab-like seal-impression of a almost round shape with a flat wide band running around the motif. The motif consists of a papyrus plant (M26) in the lower part and another sign that looks like a flying vulture in protection gesture above with both wings downwards. The seal-impression has a diameter of 1.5-1.7 cm. A thick salt crystal accretion on the surface by the base. The clay was hardened after excavation.
