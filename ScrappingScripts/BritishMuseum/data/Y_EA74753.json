{"artifact_name": "lintel", "Object Type": ["lintel"], "Museum number": ["EA74753"], "Description": [" Part of a monolithic lintel bearing a cartouche containing the prenomen of Senwosret III (originally at the centre of the entire block). On either side of the cartouche a seated deity faced outward to give the hieroglyphs for life, dominion and stability to the Horus-name of the king, written in a rectangle (now lost) beneath the falcon of the god Horus. The hieroglyphs above the figures identify the gods as Atum and Ra-Horakhty. It seems probable that it came from the same structure as the lintel EA 145.
