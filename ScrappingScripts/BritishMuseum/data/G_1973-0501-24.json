A naked man or child, modelled in the round on a low rectangular plinth, reclining with his legs extending to his right, the left leg flat to the ground, the right knee raised. He leans on a block with mouldings above and below. His huge phallus curves round in front of him. A bowl or bird (?) is held to his left side with his left hand, and his right hand reaches inside the vessel or holds the bird. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with some white inclusions; minute traces of a white dressing.

These are similar to other variants of reclining ithyphallic Harpocrates from Naukratis (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.3719; British Museum GR1973, 0501.19, GR1973,0501.20, GR1973,0501.36). Unprovenanced parallels are dated end of fourth, beginning of third century BC (Fischer 1994, no. 19) and are known from Ptolemaic Memphis (Petrie Museum UC48467, UC48376). Similar reclining Harpocrates figures were made of faience, found in a third century BC context at Athribis (Szyma\u0144ska 1999b, 73, fig. 2) and also found at Naukratis (British museum GR1886,0401.1495) and Karnak (Masson pers. com). Comparanda in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, no.3212), Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (no. 1966.1081) and in Berlin (Weber 1914; 71, fig. 41). Near, but in faience (Sotheby\u2019s New York Sale Catalogue, 18 June 1991, lots 25 and 45; June 1992, lot 246, both described as Harpokrates).
