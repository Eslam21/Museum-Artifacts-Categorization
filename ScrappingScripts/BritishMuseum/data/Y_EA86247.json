{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86247"], "Description": [" Scarab, made of turquoise frit (?), completely preserved. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line. The division between prothorax and elytra is indicated by a single line as well, as is the suture. The latter is not quite in the middle of the back. The humeral callosities are indicated by triangles incised. The shape of the head is slightly trapezoidal, only two lateral grooves that might indicate the eyes are visible, no clypeus distinguishable. The side of the scarab shows two legs on each side, on top of a base plate. The seal at the base shows a very thin oval line framing the base that is only preserved on the right side. From top to bottom a sun disc, underneath a mn-sign with a very thin base line, underneath a kheper with wings, underneath a horizontal line. The execution and shape of the signs seems strange as does the unusual colour of the object. The orientation of the seal is longitudinal as is the perforation of the object.
