A round-bottomed, two-handled pot is held in the crook of his left arm. The back is plain, but for a small circular depression for an unpierced vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface. The figure has cracked in places during firing. The front bears traces of a white dressing, with some also on the back. His sidelock is painted black and his head-ribbon has traces of green, but its buds are painted pink (one of the buds was damaged before the paint was applied); there is a black band below the lower moulding of the pier\u2019s capital.
