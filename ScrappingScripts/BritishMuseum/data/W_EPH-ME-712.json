The article reported that \"the alterations which have taken place in this wing of the Museum render it truly interesting. The various objects which some time since were crowded within the limits of which the large lions presented by Lord Prudhoe were the boundary, are now pleasingly displayed, ample space being allowed for the visitor to walk around them. Two rows of shelves have also been added to the walls, below the windows, to sustain the specimens of pottery and the smaller slabs with inscriptions: some of them have been put into oaken frames, and glass inserted so as to prevent further decay. Below are ranged the larger slabs and, fragments of fresco paintings: some are from tombs at Thebes; and one is particularly interesting, from the clever way in which the cattle are drawn. The lions before mentioned formerly stretched into the centre of the walk, from pillar to pillar, but are now removed, and placed on each side, in a line with the rest, so that an uninterrupted view is now had of the entire length of the gallery and its saloons. The large Head of Ramesses II., and its companion, stand in the centre saloon, and form striking objects as the visitor passes between them into the Phygalian Saloon. The walls of the building have been coloured in dull red; the ceiling is in compartments, with sunk panels, the ground of which is painted blue, with a Grecian ornament in gold; the mouldings around are in red and gold. The moulding under the windows and above the newly-arranged shelves is gilded and painted. The whole effect is very pleasing\"."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Fair"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: British Museum ", " Associated with: Egypt "], "Associated titles": ["Associated Title:", " Illustrated London News "], "Acquisition date": ["2012"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["EPH-ME.712"]}
