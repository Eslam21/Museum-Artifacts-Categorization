At the top is a curved sky-sign beneath which are a winged sun-disk and a line of text. In the second register the lady \u1e6ent-w\u0292-w\u0292-rw stands on the right with her arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Above are four columns of text of which only three are inscribed. Behind the altar stand Ra-Horakhty, Atum, Isis, and Nephthys. Six lines of text in the third register contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty, Atum, and Ptah-Sokar-Osiris on behalf of the lady Tadibastet, daughter of \u1e0ed-Hr and the lady T\u0292-w\u0292-w\u0292-rw. The stela has cracked into three parts along the lines of the three planks of wood which compose it and has been badly repaired. The right-hand section is not aligned correctly with the other two. The surface is cracked in places and damaged along the edges. The background of the stela is buff-white. The sky at the top is blue. The disk is red with yellow uraei whose heads are blue. The upper wings are black outlined on white with a blue upper edge; the middle are white with red lines and black dots; and the lower are green edged in black with white tips and a lower red edge. The hieroglyphs are black. The scene in the second register is surrounded by a border of red, blue, yellow, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in blue. There is a white strip at the top of the scene and a blue sky from which blue dividing lines separate the black columns of text on a white background. The female figure has a green body, red dress, yellow collar, and blue wig. The altar is yellow, and the pot blue. The lotus has a dark green stem, yellow base, green leaves, and blue flowers. The gods have green bodies, red hands, yellow collars, blue wigs, dark green sceptres, and red disks with black uraei.
