", " Parallels from Tell el-Muqdam dated to the late 5th to the 4th century BC, phase 2, under early Ptolemaic level 1. There are also good, but unprovenanced (likely Naukratis or memphis) parallels in the Petrie Museum (UC45806-7). Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Parallels are generally dated to the Late period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt. Thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl. 109, nos. 203-9, particularly no.206 from Memphis; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, pl. 50.1-5, nos. 263-7, particularly no. 266; Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie 1909, pl. 35.11; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69,3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos. 1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and theTemple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Armana (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888, 0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, (SCA), (unpublished).
