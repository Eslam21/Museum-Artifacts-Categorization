The sex of the animal on A is not evident, but it is likely to be a ram. Rams or sheep occur rarely through East Greek vase-painting. Examples are: Chiot Middle Wild Goat Style, GR 1924.12-1.1252, fragment of dinos (?) from Naucratis (JHS 1924, 213 fig. 48). Rhodian Late Wild Goat Style, 1. GR 1864.10-7.5 (A.750), plate from Camirus (A. Salzmann, N\u00e9cropole de Camiros, pl. 51; S. Zervos, Rhodes, Capitale du Dod\u00e9can\u00e8se, fig. 227); 2. B.M. 64.10-7.6 (A.743), plate from Camirus (head of ram also on underside). Egyptian-Greek (?) Late Wild Goat Style, Cairo 26.135, amphora from Saqqarah (C. C. Edgar, Catalogue General: Greek Vases, pl. 1; H. Prinz, Funde aus Naukratis, pl. 3b-c). Ionian Little Master cups, Samos, fragment of lip-cup from Samos (AM lix, pl. 6. 3). East Greek black figure, Oxford G.128.33, fragment of lid (?) from Naucratis (CVA ii, pl. GB 401. 7). Clazomenian sarcophagi, 1. Berlin University, on foot-piece (BCH 1913, pl. 10); 2. Berlin Inv. 3353, on foot-piece (AD ii, pl. 26); 3. Istanbul 1354, on footpiece; 4. Louvre, on headpiece; 5. Smyrna 2723, on footpiece; 6. Athens N.M.?, in 'black figure' technique on upper corner. There is here no orderly development or close connexion. Rams' heads occur commonly, whole rams occasionally on East Greek coins from the early fifth century onwards, and a few instances go back to the sixth century: there happens to be a good parallel for the situla on an electrum issue of Cyzicus of the earlyish fifth century (BMC Coins, Mysia, pl. 5. 11 - the fleece perhaps rubbed off). A few East Greek gems may be mentioned, of which one of the early fifth century shows the rising posture (J. D. Beazley, Lewes House Collection, pl. 9 no. 35 bis - two other references there on p. 31). Tanis ii, pl. 26. 6 (parts of A and B mixed).
