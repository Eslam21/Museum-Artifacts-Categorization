{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1906,0301.4"], "Description": [" Hand-made terracotta naive female figure, made from coarse red-brown Egyptian siltware, partially reconstructed from three fragments (head missing). It represents a woman wearing a gown reaching down to her ankles, with her right arm at her side, her left bent across her body below her breast. The figure is globally flat, apart from the modelled breasts and arms, with fingers and toes simply indicated by grooves. The large and short sloping feet show clearly that the figure is not represented standing but lying flat on the back. The item represents probably a sort of concubine.
