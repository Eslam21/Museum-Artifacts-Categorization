This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The sherd joins British Museum 1888,0601.550.b and 1924,1201.352. The sherd belongs to the group of Chian black-figured vases bearing Laconising features. Although perhaps not most clearly demonstrated on this sherd, the joining sherds offer more relevant details. Pipili argues that the winged foot probably belongs to a winged daemon. Winged daemons are found on other East Greek vases (see the Fikellura cup fragments in Pipili 1998, fig. 8.8) as well as on Laconian cups (see British Museum 1886,0401.1063). According to Pipili, rather than the Laconian painters influencing Chian and other East Greek artists, these artists influenced the Laconian painters (the Naukratis Painter in this case) as their cups were destined for an eastern market. Whilst she admits that the winged daemons on East Greek cups are later than those on Laconian cups, the motif is oriental and is absent from contemporary Attic and Corinthian vessels. According to Williams, the kylix is by the same painter as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.133.2 and AN1896-1908-G.133.6, whom he has identified as the Sirens Painter. The Sirens Painter pieces most closely resemble those by the Boreads Painter, primarily because of the single pomegranate band on the tondo of the Oxford kylix.
