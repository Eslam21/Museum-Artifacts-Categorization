{"artifact_name": "shabti", "Object Type": ["shabti"], "Museum number": ["EA64571"], "Description": [" Glazed composition shabti of Maatkara: this funerary figurine is mummiform and moulded from characteristically coloured bright blue material with black details. The long wig has braided ends and, as a sign of the deceased owner's rank (she was the daughter of a queen), the uraeus, emblem of royalty, is worn on the forehead. As is usual, the arms are crossed over the chest and each hand holds a black hoe with pointed blade. A mesh bag is stretched across the figure's lower back as a token container for seed, for harvested crops, for mud to be used in brick making or as fertilizer or perhaps for carrying the tiny laborer's bread and onion meal. The single column of text supplies only the name and title, written in a cartouche, of the shabti's owner but Maatkara was a God's Wife of Armin, the highest ranking priestess at Thebes at this period.
