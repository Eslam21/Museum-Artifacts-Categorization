Zochi's print is from a series of 41 recording drawings from Luti's collection, see commentary to 1866,1114.694. The old attribution to Titian is closer to the mark than the suggestion it is the work of Bassano; Verdizotti was a follower of Titian but his style as a draughtsman has yet to be defined. Lit.: L.
