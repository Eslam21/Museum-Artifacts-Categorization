The major skull bones were intact with minor damage to the occipital; the sphenoid was also present. The right humerus and ulna were absent from the long bones. The hand consisted of 7 metacarpals; scaphoids and capitates; the right lunate, triquetral and trapezoid; the left trapezium and 18 phalanges. Only the tali and 4 phalanges were recovered from the feet. Portions of scapulae, pelves, patellae, and vertebrae (7 cervical, 3 lumbar and the first sacral) were inventoried. Dentition-permanent 30 Dental disease: A carious lesion was present between the left maxillary premolars. Trauma: Two new embedded lithics discovered on lateral right ilium. Exostosis on the left femoral greater tuberosity. Osteochondritis dissecans on the left radial distal articular surface. Cutmarks: A total of 3 cuts were noted by Butler (1968: 1040) on the left femur: 2 below the greater trochanter on the lateral surface and a third cut above the lesser trochanter. Seven cuts were observed on the proximal and midshaft of the right femur and 2 cuts occurred on the left humerus (ibid.). New cutmarks on the distal right clavicle were revealed in this investigation. Other: Periostitis on the left and right proximal femoral shafts. Poirier's facet on right femur.
