", " East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of a Classical Greek type (broadly 500BC-400BC). The fabric and style is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, Type B2, pl.120) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated late 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, nos 237-9, 295, GR1885,1213.41). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
