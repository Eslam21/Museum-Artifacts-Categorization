Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the profile finds parallels with his Type 9C South Ionian cup with everted rim. Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups. These correspond with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.696) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.692"]}
