A fragment of a similar vessel was found in a looted tomb (no. 6) located on the coastal scarp at Tsaroukkas during excavations conducted as part of the Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project (Manning and Monks 1998, 329 and fig. 16). It has been suggested that this was a Cypriot adaptation of an basic Egyptian type, as there are no known Egyptian parallels for the specific examples found on Cyprus.
