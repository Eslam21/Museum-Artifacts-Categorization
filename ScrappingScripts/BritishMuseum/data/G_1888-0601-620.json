Red paint applied to the inscription can also be observed in a few other cases of grey ware at Naukratis. ", " While the remark about the dative plural is true of literary texts, one may suggest that it may not apply in the strongly Ionic environment of Naukratis or indeed in everyday Aeolic prose. If 1888,0601.703 does belong we may note that the whole would contain the typically Aeolic katheke, not anetheke. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 67, no. 840, pl.
