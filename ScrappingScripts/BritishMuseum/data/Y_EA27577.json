{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA27577"], "Description": [" Fragmentary solid-cast figure of Neith in copper alloy, fixed on an inscribed hollow-cast plinth. Figure broken off at ankles; deity depicted standing on small rectangular base, in striding pose; base partly detached from the larger hollow-cast rectangular plinth into which it is inserted by a thick rectangular tang. The larger plinth bears incised decoration: on the top surface, nine bows incised; on the front, a squatting figure wearing the Red Crown (probably the goddess Neith), upon an open lotus flower, between two winged goddesses, with star-filled band or sky-hieroglyph above; the other three sides of the large plinth bore a hieroglyphic dedicatory inscription to Neith, now partly lost.

It does not appear in the content of the hoard listed in the publication of Petrie (Petrie 1886, 41-42). However, Petrie mentioned in his journal, a \u2018box-stand inscribed\u2019 among the bronze finds (Masson forthcoming), which corresponds to this specimen. The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). This figure probably belongs to the type 136 (or maybe the rarer type 137?) in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, with Neith represented standing in a striding pose (Weiss 2012, 242-243, 693-698, Taf. 35d-i). This type is particularly well documented in Sais where Neith was the patron goddess, but also in the Memphite region and a few more attestations in Bubastis and Athribis (Weiss 2012, 243).
