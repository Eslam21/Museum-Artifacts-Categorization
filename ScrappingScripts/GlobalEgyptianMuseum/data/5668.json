{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "8493", "Dating": "MACEDONIAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Height": "36 cm", "Width": "25.7 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "Wooden tomb stelae placed in the offering chamber of the tomb are a characteristic feature of the Late Period. Another typical element of this period is that the veneration of the deity depicted on these stelae, as also on the present example, is not that of the mortuary god Osiris but of the sun god. In the top of the stela the winged sun disk stands over the hieroglyph for heaven. Beneath it is a tightly framed scene with an offering table and the sun god Re and Atum on the left and to the right the lady Mer-hathor-ites. The prayer for offerings is written in six lines underneath. It is directed to the sun god in his name of Harakhty, to the Memphite mortuary god Sokar-Osiris, and to Anubis. Osiris is invoked at the end."}
