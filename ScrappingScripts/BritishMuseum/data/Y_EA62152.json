{"artifact_name": "bead; pendant", "Object Type": [" bead ", " pendant "], "Museum number": ["EA62152"], "Description": [" A string of three 'Purpura' shells, two very badly damaged, ten 'Nerita' shells, three bone barrel beads and six pendants of various materials. Two of the bone beads are long barrels and the other is a standard barrel. The black limestone pendant is roughly oblong in shape and all its surfaces are decorated with incised cross-hatching. The flat, semicircular pendant with off-centre boring is of red porphyry. The drop pendant, flat on upper and lower surfaces, of black and white diorite is 2.4cm long. The small bone tooth-shaped pendant, now mottled brown in colour, is concave on one face and convex on the other. The two remaining pendants are pebbles: one, of quartz, has pink and white banding, a flat top edge and a rounded lower one; the other pebble pendant of agate has brown and white banding and is roughly triangular in section.
