The steatite is of a grey colour, a white glaze is preserved on all parts. The division between head and prothorax is not indicated, the division between prothorax and elytra is shown by two lateral small notches, the area underneath the head shows a sign of a roughly carved circle. No suture is shown. The head and clypeus are shown in one elongated and raised shape, no eyes are visible. The clypeus is shown without details. The area next to the head shows several incised lines that follow the curve of the body. When the object is turned upside down it looks like an abstract human face. The side of the scarab shows one lateral incised line on each side. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, inside a decorative pattern of four loops arranged in a cross with four triangular shapes in between them, lined with the centre of the loops. The longitudinal perforation is fully preserved.
