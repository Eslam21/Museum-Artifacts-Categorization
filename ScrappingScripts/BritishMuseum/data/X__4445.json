", " The arm depicted on the sherd is similar to those of komasts snapping fingers on black-figure Komast Chalices; however there is no evidence of black-figure incision on the sherd. Furthermore, the filling ornament on the sherd is not found on such chalices. Human figures do not appear on Chian pottery before the introduction of the Grand Style. The presence of filling ornament suggests that the sherd ought to belong within Lemos's Group with the Filling Ornament, where the features typical for this Grand Style group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. Unlike the typical male figures in the group, the figure on this sherd is not rendered in outline. In later Grand Style vases, male figures are depicted with coloured flesh. Finally, the attempt at creating some perspective is rather clumsy.
