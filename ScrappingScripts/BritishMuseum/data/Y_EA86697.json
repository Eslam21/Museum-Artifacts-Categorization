{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86697"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with one big rows of basketry coil impression at one side, at the other side shows two smaller further basketry coil impressions, meaning that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The side shows probably string impressions. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica and charcoal bits. The clay was hardened after excavation and the rear was not cleaned properly before. The front shows two parts of impressions of a scarab-like seal, the second impression is broken into half where the string is visible at the side. There are finger impressions around them. The motif is difficult to determine, it looks like a standing figure at the upper left part, facing to the right, maybe Pharaoh with a blue crown, offering to some deity sitting on a throne.
