According to Gorton, this scarab\u2019s type was probably not produced in Naukratis as it appears in an early 7th century BC context (tomb 16 from Carthage, Dermech: see Vercoutter 1945, no. 379) and as the name Menkara refers to a 25th dynasty prince (Gorton 1996, 80, 88). Petrie considered that it was, nonetheless, a product of the 26th Dynasty (Petrie 1889, pl. 61, no. 1939). The 'k\u0292' could also be a degenerate '\u1e2bpr', therefore Menkara could stand for Menkheperra (see Gorton 1996, type XXV A30 with cartouches of Menkara and Menkheperra on the same scarab).
