This fine shawabti figurine has the face of the king, depicted as very young, wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt. It is generally thought that the White Crown was made of silver, while the Red Crown of Lower Egypt was made of ruddy colored copper. These figurines were needed to magically assist the deceased in carrying out certain manual duties in the afterworld.The forehead of the king is ornamented with bronze heads of the vulture and the cobra, the protective deities of Upper and Lower Egypt respectively. The face is sensitively carved with eye details marked in black; the whites are painted in.The body is wrapped in a shroud, as a mummy, and bears four lines of inscription containing the shawabti text. His hands are crossed like those of the god Osiris to hold the flail, now missing, and the crook scepter, which has survived. The whole body is gilded except for the face and hands, which are left in the natural wood"}
