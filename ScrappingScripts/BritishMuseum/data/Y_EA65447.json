{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA65447"], "Description": [" Serpentine female figure standing on a slim rectangular base. The figure wears a smooth Hathor wig with curled ends of the hair reaching to the chest, and a separate broad section of hair at the back. The wig is tucked behind her extremely oversized ears. She has a small rounded face with large eyes and a heavy upper eyelid. The nose and mouth are slim, and there is little definition of the neck area from the upper body. She wears a tight-fitting sheath dress with edges of material delineated across the breasts and waist. Her elongated arms are held by the sides of the body. Her waist is extremely narrow while her hips and legs are broad, and her feet are placed close together. On the reverse is a broad back-pillar which appears to be uninscribed. A modern paper label on the lower section of the back-pillar identifies the item as being from Karnak. There are small chips and scratches around the base, feet, and on both sides of the back-pillar.

Such figures typically contained an inscription across the back-pillar or base with the name and title(s) of the subject, though here both surfaces appear to be uninscribed."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["good"], "Acquisition name": ["Bequeathed by: Henry Swainson Cowper"], "Acquisition date": ["1951"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased in Luxor in 1889."], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA65447"], "Registration number": ["1951,0714.5"]}
