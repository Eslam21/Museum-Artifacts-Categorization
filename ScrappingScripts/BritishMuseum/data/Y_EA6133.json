{"artifact_name": "plaque", "Object Type": ["plaque"], "Museum number": ["EA6133"], "Description": [" Glazed composition plaque of Amenemopet: the decoration painted prior to firing in black (probably manganese oxide) shows a seated Osiris on the left, mummiform and holding the traditional crook and flail that are the symbols of his kingship of the Underworld. Opposite is Amenemopet, with arms upraised in an attitude of adoration. Above each figure are columns of text identifying them. Above Amenemopet the text faces toward Osiris, as Amenemopet himself does, and he is described as the royal scribe and overseer of the storehouse of the Lotd of the Two Lands, Amenem(opet). The columns begin just above his left hand and move to the right. The assured drawing of the figure of Amenemopet, as though alive and outfitted in the fine linen attire of the elite, is contrasted with the flat, outlined figure of Osiris with little interior detail.
