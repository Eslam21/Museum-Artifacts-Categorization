Though Sampaio argues that it was preparatory to this painting, it is generally considered to be a later copy after the work by one of Rubens\u2019 assistants and subsequently retouched by Rubens. The heavy handling in black chalk of the composition is reflective of drawings from the 1630s when Rubens\u2019 delegated pupils to repeat his compositions for translation into print. This composition was subsequently used for an engraving by Marinus van der Goes and the lines are incised for transfer (Hollstein 4; see R,3.48 for an impression). That Marinus was active in Antwerp in the 1630s supports the dating of the present drawing to this period, as a print modello is unlikely to have been made earlier. The drawn composition was retouched in oil prior to its engraving by Rubens to give it more energy and ultimately to make the surface of the drawing his own. Rubens frequently intervened in the work of his pupils in this manner \u2013 another instance is the \u2018Coup de Lance\u2019 also in the BM (see inv. no. 1994,0514.39 ) Lit: J.

Rowlands, \u2018Rubens: Drawings and Sketches\u2019, exhibition catalogue, British Museum,1977, no.171: This belongs to a group of drawings modelled on compositions earlier in date, which the artist has adapted as designs for engravings. The composition is closer in its details to the oil-sketch of about 1625 in the Gulbenkian collection in Lisbon rather than the one in Kassel of about 1614. In the later version the influence of Elsheimer, which inspired the creation of the earlier work, has been lost. Rubens not only greatly admired Elsheimer's own painting of this subject but also had hoped to succeed in acquiring it for himself after the artist's tragically early death. The present drawing is the preparatory design for the engraving by Marinus van der Goes (see R,3.48) and the initial work in black chalk has been mechanically done by an assistant. But fortunately Rubens has gone over this so thoroughly in bodycolour that the reworked design is largely his own. It should probably be dated in the late 1630s, as Held has proposed."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hind 1915-31 / Catalogue of Dutch and Flemish Drawings preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum (7) ", " Rowlands 1977 / Rubens, drawings and sketches (171) ", " Corpus Rubenianum V.1 / Rubens.
