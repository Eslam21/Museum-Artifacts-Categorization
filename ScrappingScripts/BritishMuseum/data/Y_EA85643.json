{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA85643"], "Description": [" Clay figure made of a brown fine clay that was lightly fired and consolidated after excavation resulting in a darker surface colour. The object itself is very crudely formed, roughly horizontally cylindrical with slightly pointed ends. One end has been pinched together and curls slightly upwards. From the other end another piece would have been run off but is broken off. A small, horizontal slit appears on one side, its outer end was formed out of the main body part still showing three small (children) finger impressions on each side of the slit. The slit itself measures 1.05 x 0.2 cm and has a depth of about 2.2 cm, maybe another (part of an) object was attached here. The object could have been a stylized animal figurine.
