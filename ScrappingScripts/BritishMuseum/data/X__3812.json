", " This sacred musical instrument was particularly associated to the cult of Egyptian goddesses, notably Hathor, Isis, Bastet or Sekhmet (on sistra, see esp.: Hickmann 1949, p. 76-103, pl. XLV-LXX ; Pinch 1993, p. 143-146 ; Ziegler 1979, p. 31-62 ; Ziegler 1984). Naukratis provided several examples of sistra, in copper alloy like for this specimen, but also in glazed composition. Some of them can be dated to the 26th dynasty, supporting the practice of Egyptian cult activities in this period (Yoyotte 1994-95, 674; Masson forthcoming). Bronze sistra with a middle part consisting of a head of Hathor framed by two uraei are very common (from Herakleion Thonis: Goddio and Fabre 2008, 334, no. 288). The cat below the arched frame (frame missing here) represents the lioness Sekhmet propitiated and transformed in a peaceful cat by the sistrum (for similar examples, see e.g.: Hickmann 1949, CG no. 69305, 69308-69310, 69328; Ziegler 1979, no. 68-75). It belongs to a series of sistra which are difficult to date, possibly during the Late Period (Ziegler 1979, 37). Goddio, F. and Fabre D. 2008 (eds), Egypt\u2019s sunken treasures, Munich.
