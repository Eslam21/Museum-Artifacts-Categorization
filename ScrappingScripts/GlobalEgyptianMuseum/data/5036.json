As the one who has mastered evil she is trampling on a serpent. Since the Ptolemaic Period, the sphinx was the embodiment of the well-known god Tutu (Greek Tithoes). His mother Neith, depicted as her counterpart Athena-Minerva, is holding a victory wreath. Petbe, the personification of equalising justice, is depicted as a griffin. He is holding a wheel and a palm branch in his raised paws. The stela is a typical example of the mixed nature of this period, in which the Egyptian elements are being overwhelmed by Greek and Roman elements."}
