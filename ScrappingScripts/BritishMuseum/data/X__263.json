", " Three similar pieces from Naukratis may come from same mould series (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA582; Amsterdam, Allard Pierson Museum 7483; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire E.5018). Simple naked female figure plaques are common in Egypt during the Late Period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Parallels are generally dated to the Late Period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt, possibly to early Ptolemaic and though to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.109, nos 203-9, particularly no.207; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, no.263-7, for wig, see no. 264; Weber 1914, no.199; Petrie 1909, pl.35.7 and 12 from Memphis; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69:3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 clear with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos 24 to 26) and the Temple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Amarna (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888,0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Archaeology, (SCA), (unpublished).
