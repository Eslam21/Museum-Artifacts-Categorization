", " The amulet reproduces the shape of a ceremonial staff-terminal. For examples with falcon on standard, see BM 1946,1204.69 or BM 1842,0728.21. Naukratis provided a few staff-terminals and especially two depicting a snake on a papyrus-column: BM 1885,1101.104 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.815. Standing falcons wearing a double-crown belong to the type T19 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 740-745, Pl. 44, Typ T 19). Such bronze figures are well documented in various Late Period contexts in the Delta. Examples stemmed from the Memphite region, particularly in the falcon complex and catacomb in North Saqqara (Davies, Smith 2005), but also from Herakleion, Buto and Athribis. Numerous falcon figures, mainly amuletic figures made out of copper alloy, but also glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis, including rather large amuletic figures in glazed composition likely produced locally (Masson forthcoming). Even though the MFA database lists the Scarab Factory as the findspot, the EEF list seems to list this object separately from those objects found in the Scarab Factory. Caution is therefore required for the specific findspot of this piece and, subsequently, its dating should not be only limited to the activity of the Scarab Factory in the 26th dynasty.
