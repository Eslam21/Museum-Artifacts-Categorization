{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.109"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of satyr with child Dionysos. A young satyr carries the child Dionysos in the crook of his left arm. Dionysos is naked and the satyr wears a short fringed tunic rolled down to his waist; a bunch of grapes is hooked through the waistband. The child, whose head is lost, reaches out towards the satyr\u2019s head, which is thrown back. The satyr\u2019s hair rises from his head, and a break at the top may indicate the presence of a fillet tied into a bow; he holds aloft in his right hand another bunch of grapes. The back is plain and part of a circular vent remains: much of the right side of the group is lost below the waistband and the left side is broken away at mid-thigh. Hollow, from two-piece mould, with a few traces of a white dressing surviving on the front, with even fewer signs of an orange-pink paint. Brown Nile silt with a darkbrown surface, abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions.
