", " Archaic East Greek protome of late Archaic date (510BC to 480 BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019 though numerous production places are known across East Greece. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, of Type A1 dated \u2018late Archaic\u2019, after 525BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.116, nos 2463 and 2465). A number of fragments from the same type of protome may come from the same piece (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA452, NA761 and possibly NA831; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.8.1899; British Museum GR 2011,5009.275), or are from similar protomes (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA470, NA361, NA356, NA323). Hair form found on a number of late Archaic protome forms dated 510 BC to 480 BC (Croissant 1983, 164 nos 48, 142, 233-8, 242) and at Olynthus dated late 6th or early 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.4 no.3) and Camirus, Rhodes, dated to the mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no.243).
