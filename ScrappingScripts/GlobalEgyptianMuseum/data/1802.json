The form is typical of mid- to late fourth millennium BC richer burials in Upper Egypt. This vessel was excavated at the key early settlement near Kom el-Ahmar (the Hierakonpolis of later texts) in southern Upper Egypt. The grave goods date the burial to the middle of the fourth millennium, when the culture of Upper Egypt had not yet extended over the distinct cultures of Lower Egypt."}
