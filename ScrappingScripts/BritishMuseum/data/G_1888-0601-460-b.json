Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Naukratis Painter and/or the Naukratis Painter\u2019s Group. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. However, the depiction of figures is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. However, unlike other sherds by the Naukratis Painter, the exterior decoration here is mostly in outline and the interior decoration is sparse. The thickness and size of the sherd suggest that the vase was a heavy chalice."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
