Amongst the four hedgehog aryballoi said to come from Naukratis, only BM 1886,0401.1501 can be assuredly assigned to the site (Webb 1978, 133, no. 905, pl. 21), while the provenance of the aryballoi kept in Edinburgh, Copenhagen and New York is highly doubtful (Webb forthcoming). The aryballos in the shape of an African head \u2013 Boston Museum of Fine Arts 03.835 \u2013 is also unlikely coming from Naukratis. To the British Museum specimen can be added two fragments of aryballoi kept at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (Eg.Inv.3623-3624). All these examples of finds actually made on the site of Naukratis demonstrate the poor conditions of preservation which prevailed there -either due to damp and their making up part of what were rubbish dumps in antiquity, or the damage caused by the conditions prevailing in the 1880's when the Sebakhin were extracting the rich soil for fertiliser. Their fragmentary condition makes it even less likely that complete examples can be assigned a findspot from Naukratis itself, although this does not rule out the possibility of their manufacture there. See the comment on fragmentary hedgehog aryballoi noted by Edgar in piles of rubbish near the scarab factory. (Hogarth 1905, 134). Such containers were very popular in the Mediterranean world during the 6th-early 5th century BC and belong to the Phase III in the Archaic Greek Faience typology by Webb (Webb 1978, 133\u20135; Webb forthcoming; Pierrat-Bonnefois forthcoming). Apart from Naukratis, other Egyptian sites provided aryballoi in faience, such as Tell el Yehudiyeh and Thebes (Webb 1978, nos 907\u2013915).
