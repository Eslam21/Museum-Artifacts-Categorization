[from] a local native trader and he told me they mostly came from the Nupe country, of which Bida is the chief town of the Nupe ... Some probably came from the Munshi country in the extreme South of Muri province - either from Abinsi on the Benue or Katsena Allah on the Katsena river. The man I got the blue ones from said they were very old and claimed that they originally came from Egypt. Others he said came from Nupe graves - I think these were some of the brown ones - Some are evidently modern and were \"thrown in\" with the others ...'"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Lt-Col.
