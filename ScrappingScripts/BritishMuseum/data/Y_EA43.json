However, the object does not appear in the manuscript list of the collection dating to 1842, nor in the list of objects registered, and indeed not in the publication of the Belmore collection in the AES library. However, it appears as no. 17 in the Synopsis of 1835 in the Egyptian Salon; hence it arrived in the museum before 1843. As yet, no details of when have surfaced. Although found when Salt was active in Thebes, there is no trace of it in the records of the first Salt Collection. The Birch Slips give no provenance information. [NCS Feb 2005] I note [NCS 28/10/05] that a drawing of the boat appears in Yorke and Leake, Remarks on some Egyptian monuments in England, (1826), pl V, fig 14. According to the text p. 8 'From the collection of Lord Belmore'. Does this mean the boat was in Belmore's house collection at that time?"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA43"], "Registration number": [".43"], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 23 Dec 1993 ", " Treatment: 20 Feb 2015 "]}
