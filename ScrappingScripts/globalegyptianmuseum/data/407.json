{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2591", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "RIFA", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "7.9 cm", "Width": "12.3 cm", "Name": "Figurine of a sleeping woman", "Description": "Statues of naked women, stretched out on a bed, are collectively known as \"concubines\" of the dead. They appear in great number from the New Kingdom onwards. Their specific role is not very clear: could it be that the figurines were destined to ensure the sexual activity of the deceased in the Afterlife, and the procreation which results from it? The Brussels example represents a naked woman, wearing an imposing black wig which is surmounted by a perfume cone. Her body carries traces of many different colours. The bed, very simple, is provided with a geometric decoration of which the colours have practically disappeared. "}
