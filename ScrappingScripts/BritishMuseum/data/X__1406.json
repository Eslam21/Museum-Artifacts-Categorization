", " There are a few, rare, crocodile figure parallels from Naukratis (Gutch 1899, 96, no. 336; Boston 86.426; Fitzwilliam E.224.1899; Ashmolean AN1896-1908-E.4789). These may be from stand-alone figures, or fragments from vessels. The style and materials are consistent with Late period, or possibly very early Ptolemaic figurines made in the Nile Delta. Crocodile figures were made in Egypt since at least the Middle Kingdom (Petrie Museum UC6678, from Coptos; UC7193-7 from Lahun) and subsequently (Petrie Museum UC42136, unprovenanced).
