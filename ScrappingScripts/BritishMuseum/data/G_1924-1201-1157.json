The sherd also belongs to the same vessel as British Museum 1924,1201.35 and 1924,1201.36. According to Cook, the decoration seems to have been inspired by the conventional representation of a bird, specifically a partridge: scales for the breast feathers and bars for the folded wings. The breast-feather panel narrowing towards the bottom and the red on these feathers are unusual; the black bands are unusually wide. For a complete oinochoe with this decoration, see Walter-Karydi 1973, pl. 4, no. 47 from Rhodes. For parallels, see Louvre A321 from Camiros."], "Bibliographic references": [" Cook 1933-1934 / Fikellura Pottery (p. 40, no. 5) ", " M\u00f6ller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece (p. 247, no. 3b) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GF.145) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["bird"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.1157"], "Joined objects": [" Associated Group: G16326 (5 objects) ", " Joined Object Group: G16250 (4 objects) "]}
