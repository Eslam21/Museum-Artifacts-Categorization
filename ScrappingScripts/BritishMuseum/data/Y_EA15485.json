{"artifact_name": "lamp; figure", "Object Type": [" lamp ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["EA15485"], "Description": [" Terracotta lamp with the figure of Bes: this object is a hybrid of Egyptian and Roman culture. The sculpted base represents the Egyptian god Bes. Atop his head, in place of Bes's familiar feathered headdress, is a Roman lamp with two nozzles and a decorative leaf-shaped attachment over the triangular handle. Bes normally appears naked from the waist down; as a concession to Roman taste, the artisan who designed the lamp clothed Bes in a short skirt that covers his genitals.
