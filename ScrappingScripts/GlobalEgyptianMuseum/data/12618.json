{"Present location": "ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM [06/002] AMSTERDAM", "Inventory number": "APM 9115", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "BOAT (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "32.5 cm", "Width": "14 cm", "Name": "Model of a boat with crew", "Description": "The hull of the boat is carved from a single piece of wood; the deck is somewhat hollowed out. The base has been flattened so that the boat stands firmly, a keel is therefore absent. On the stern, which is higher than the stem, a small block of wood has been fastened on which the steering oars once rested. There are no traces of a bowsprit.The figurines are made of separate pieces of wood: head, body and legs in one piece, the arms are attached separately. The mast, now lacking the sail, stands in the centre of the deck. On the mast, red/brown and black painted ropework is visible. On the after-deck stands a pole which is shorter and thicker than the mast. The steering oars were once attached to this pole.On the stem stands the pilot, facing port-side, and stretching his arms downward. The steersman stands on the after-deck, also facing port-side, stretching out his right arm above the left. Two rows of four rowers are squatting on the deck, some of them stretching out both arms, some bending one or both. One rower has lost both his arms. They are all slightly different in style, as if they were made by different craftsmen. The pilot and one of the rowers wear a black skull-cap, the other figurines wear black wigs. The steersman and six of the rowers are bearded. The standing steersman and pilot are dressed in short white kilts without details; the rowers are dressed in similar kilts that touch the deck. Only two of them have articulate legs and feet.The figurines are somewhat crude, and the arms are relatively too long and thin."}
