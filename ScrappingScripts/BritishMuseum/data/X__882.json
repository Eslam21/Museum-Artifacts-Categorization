", " Falcons are often associated with Horus, though various deities and the pharaoh himself can assume a falcon form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54); the identification of the deity represented is even harder in the case of amulets (Andrews 1994, 27-28; on various types of falcon amulets: Herrmann et al. 2010, 103-104). Numerous amulets of falcon, made out of bronze, glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). The headdress is unusual in the corpus of falcon amulets from Naukratis. Falcon deity crowned with two tall plumes and sun-disc could be more associated to the Theban warrior god Montu (Andrews 1994, 29-30). Such type of amulet is not known prior to the Third Intermediate Period (see for example an amulet in Egyptian blue in Herrmann et al. 2010, 104, no. 11).
