", " The vessel belongs to the same vase as Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA271b. Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the profile and decoration find parallels with his South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9A. The type closely follows the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type VIII (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape.
