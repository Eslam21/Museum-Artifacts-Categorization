On the left side is a lug, marked but not pierced. At the rear is a double-ribbed handle, knotted and dividing to upper springs which embrace the filling-hole; there is a small vine-leaf thumb-rest. The lamp-lid is hinged at the rear of the filling-hole, and is decorated with a squatting mouse, eating. The handle-springs and lug are indicated by grooves; the nozzle-top is decorated with dotted lines, and the left side is decorated with random dots, or possibly two letters, the second perhaps a seriffed mu. The ring-base is deeply concave within.
