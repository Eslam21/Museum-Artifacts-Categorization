Both surfaces are polished. The firing process and oxidation was not fully achieved, which resulted in the surface varying in colour from orange-beige to dark grey. The vase is entirely covered with shallow incisions: a criss-cross pattern at the bottom and herringbone pattern on the body. Both this vessel shape and this type of decoration were favoured by Nubian people during the first half of the second millennium B.C."}
