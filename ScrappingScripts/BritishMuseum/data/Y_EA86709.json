{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86709"], "Description": [" Almost complete seal-impression with two smaller rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side one further rows of a larger size with small string impressions, showing that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica, some salt incrustations can be seen. The clay was hardened after excavation. The top part shows the impression of an oval and elongated seal that possibly originates from a ring bezel and there are some finger prints around the seal impression. The seal impression is shallow but clearly cut and shows a circumferential band, inside one column of hieroglyphs facing to the left. The most upper sign is illegible, right of it a nfr, underneath an erected cobra (like I14 but with a shorter tail), on top of a horizontal line that could be an 'n', underneath another sign that could be kA, right of it a vertical stroke (Z1) and underneath a nb-basket. Same seal as used on EA86702.
