After he defeated Mark Anthony at Actium in 30 BC., he incorporated Egypt into the Roman Empire and became the first Roman Emperor of Egypt. This royal head shows a king wearing the Egyptian royal headdress called nemes. Below the headdress, curls of his hair fall on his forehead; therefore, it is thought that the statue is that of Octavius, who was known for this characteristic.The ears are uncovered under the nemes and the features are eroded by the effect of the sea water. Traces of the uraeus are still visible at the top of the forehead."}
