{"artifact_name": "ornament", "Object Type": ["ornament"], "Museum number": ["EA20871"], "Description": [" Mosaic glass slice: on a lavender-blue field is a standing 'ba'-bird with unusually large wings, one extended at shoulder height, the other drooping down. The colours are red, yellow, blue, and black. The 'ba'-bird has a white head with black hair. An exceptional detail is that the bird's mouth is wide open as if shrieking - a vivid illustration of the decline of an ancient iconography. The scale is small and the quality very fine. Set in a nineteenth-century gold mounting.
