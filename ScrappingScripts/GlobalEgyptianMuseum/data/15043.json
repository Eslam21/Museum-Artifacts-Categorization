{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62007", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "TRUMPET", "Material": "GOLD; SILVER; WOOD", "Technique": "HAMMERING; CHASING", "Name": "The Silver Trumpet of Tutankhamun", "Description": "This silver trumpet with its golden mouthpiece was found with a decorated wooden core inside, probably to protect the thin metal from distortion, or to help in cleaning inside its tube with a piece of cloth. The decoration on the bell shows incised scenes of the gods Amun-Re and Re-Horakhty before Ptah. From experiments, the sound produced was described as \"raucous and powerful\" and it is likely that the trumpet signal code was a rhythmic one on a single pitch."}
