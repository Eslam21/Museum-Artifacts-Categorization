Two beads and two reels of the astragal are preserved and located in an obtuse angle. On the relief ground traces of applied red paint are visible, as well as blue colour on the underside of the moulding. The surface of a dart, which points between two reels, is fractured, as is the curved edge of the right adjoining leaf. The fragment is made of a grey and glazed marble.

Traces of the cyma suggested an Ionic cyma rather than a Lesbian, even though the traces on the surface have great similarity with the corner fragment B 410 (Altekamp). There is therefore not sufficient evidence for a precise allocation.
