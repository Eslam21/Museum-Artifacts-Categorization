{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:791", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "1 cm", "Name": "Amulet", "Description": "Blue faience amulet very roughly in the shape of a human leg and foot, with hole for suspension. Amulets in the form of parts of the body are more common in earlier periods, but this example was found at the temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari, focus of the cult of the goddess Hathor on the West Bank at Thebes. Numerous votive offerings to the goddess were left by men and women, probably seeking the safe birth of a child. The offerings include a high proportion of blue faience items, presumably a material and colour associated by the Egyptians with fertility."}
