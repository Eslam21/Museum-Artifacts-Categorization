They once stood in front of great ram-headed sphinxes that lined the avenue from the tenth pylon of Karnak to the Mut temple precinct nearby. The King's statues were intended to show respect for the god and receive protection from him. The statue depicts the king with his arms crossed on his chest holding the insignia of Osiris, the god of the dead, the Heqa scepter, and the flail Nekhekh of dignity. The King is wearing the Nemes linen head cloth, which leaves his ears free to hear the prayers. The king, in this sculpture, is identified with the god Osiris, thus coming under his protection. He could then share the offerings and prayers brought to the god.Hundreds of stone statues and thousands of bronze statuettes were found hidden for about three millennia in a cache in the court of the seventh pylon of Karnak. Among these, a few sculptures in the round were found that represented the young King Tutankhamun"}
