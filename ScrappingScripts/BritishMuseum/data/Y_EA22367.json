{"artifact_name": "bellows", "Object Type": ["bellows"], "Museum number": ["EA22367"], "Description": [" A bellows made from coarse red siltware pottery, in the form of a cylindrical chamber with flat base and oblique rim, and a long straight pipe of semi-circular cross-section, branching off from near the base of the chamber on one side. The underside of the whole object is rough, showing it was manufactured on the ground surface, but the other surfaces have been smoothed by hand. In the base are two small round holes linked by a recessed groove. One of the holes, in the projecting tubular portion, just penetrates 9mm into the object and then ends. The other, in the bottom of the cylindrical part, passes right through to the interior to emerge close to the outlet for the pipe. These holes and the connecting groove are evidence for an ancient repair of the object after the projecting pipe had been broken from the cylinder. A staple, probably of copper, would have been inserted in each hole and along the groove to bind together the two parts. The object was fired at a low temperature and retains a black core.
