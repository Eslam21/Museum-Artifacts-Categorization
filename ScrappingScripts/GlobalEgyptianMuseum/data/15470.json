{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 53496", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF SHARQIYA", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "26 cm", "Name": "Unidentified Royal Head", "Description": "This royal head was certainly part of a statue, but because of the absence of any inscription, it is difficult to identify it as a particular pharaoh. The king was originally depicted wearing the Nemes royal headdress. Only the front part of the headdress can be seen as the rest is completely damaged. The cobra, or uraeus, that once adorned the royal headdress is missing. Despite the damage that affected his facial features, the smile on his lips is visible."}
