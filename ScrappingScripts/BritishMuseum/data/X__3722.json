", " The scene figured on the base is well attested on New Kingdom scarabs (Jaeger 1982, 194, \u00a71314-1315; Magnarini 2004, 295). However, a comparable scene can be seen on a bead dated between the 22nd and 30th Dynasty (Fraser 1900, 52, pl. XV n\u00b0439) and on a scarab discovered in a Ptolemaic context in Karnak (Masson forthcoming a). Considering the style of this specimen, a Ramesside date seems more appropriate.
