{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "48.25.5", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF", "Height": "13.1 cm", "Width": "9.4 cm", "Depth": "3 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "This small round-topped and uninscribed stela is decorated on one side only. The stone has been smoothed on the base but the back is still rough. The decoration is framed by a narrow line border. In the arch is the winged sun-disk, with some detailing of the feathers on the wings. The main scene below depicts a god (possibly Re-Harakhty) standing at the right, facing the figure of a man on the left. The god holds a was-sceptre in his right hand and his left arm is at his side. The man holds a staff in his left hand and has what appears to be a sidelock, between the figures is a table of offerings.Traces of colour are still evident, red on the feet, legs and head of the deceased and also on the sun-disk. The figures are quite crudely worked."}
