", " Boardman notes that the sherd belongs to the same vase as Oxford AN1896-1908-G120.8 and AN1896-1908-G120.20. The creatures on AN1896-1908-G120.8 are more likely to represent sphinxes since the figure on the far left has a tail and the figure on the right has a curlicue which is also seen on sirens in general but not on the siren depicted on this sherd. Lemos places this sherd in Stage 1 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless.
