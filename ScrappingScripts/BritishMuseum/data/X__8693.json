This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The exterior and interior surfaces of the sherd were burned during the bombings in London in 1941. The sherd belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.493.c and possibly 1888,0601.493.b both of which Lemos ascribes to the Aphaia Group. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found in the sanctuary of Aphaia on Aegina. Vessels from this group display a thematic unity, with figures in garments and in particular in the treatment of the lower parts of chitons and himatia. None have any filling ornament and the interior decoration of some consists of komasts rendered in the light on dark technique. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women.
