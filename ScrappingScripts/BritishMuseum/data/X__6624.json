This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic elements and the absence of decoration on the interior and exterior surfaces make it impossible to determine whether it comes from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two concentric white bands (Williams 1983, 169). The Ure Museum received sherds from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in 1926, several years after Petrie and Gardner's excavations. It was uncertain then whether the sherds came from Naukratis or Tell Dafana, a site in the eastern Nile Delta that was excavated by Petrie in 1886. Petrie wrote that he found only one sherd of Chian ware at Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888 62), which he described as a plain piece, thus the Chian sherds in the Reading collection come from Naukratis.
