{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "2660", "Dating": "PSAMMETICHUS I/WAHIBRE (not before); LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING BY WAXWORK", "Height": "13 cm", "Name": "Statuette of an adorant", "Description": "The votive statuette represents a striding man with his left foot advanced and his arms upraised in a gesture of adoration. He wears a long garment with a triangular front panel; his head is shaven. The base of the statuette bears an inscription containing a prayer to Osiris with the name and filiation of a certain Wahibre. This name similar to those of two kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, Psammetichus I and Apries gives the terminus ante quem non and allow us to date the statuette to the Saite period."}
