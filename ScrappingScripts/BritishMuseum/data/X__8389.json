", " Although Lemos does not specifically mention this sherd, the parallels found in the subject matter and execution indicate that it ought to belong to her Group of Light-Walled Naukratis Animal Chalices. All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 981). For parallels with other vessels, see British Museum 1924,1201.264, 1924,1201.255 and 1924,1201.259 which may be by the same painter.
