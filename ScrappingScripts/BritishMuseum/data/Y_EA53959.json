The stopper has been impressed with a circular stamp and then painted red (only faint traces remain). There is a diagonal mark left by string used for removal and a hole drilled to allow fermentation. The stamp impression appears to depict a Chi-Rho (28mm across) surrounded with Latin text.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1 & 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1 & 7). The black sealant on the underside of the plug, probably pine pitch, and the fermentation hole confirm that the amphora stopper was used for wine (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). The plug is made from a chocolate-brown Nile silt amphora sherd, suggesting that it was used to seal Egyptian wine, probably in an Egyptian amphora. For the Chi-Rho motif, common in late Roman contexts in Egypt, cf., stamp from Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 28.10\u201312). See also, EA 53958. The Latin text DEDEI DONA is perhaps a 'gift,' 'donation' or 'dedication,' cf. dedit donum, \u2018donated gift.\u2019 Bruy\u00e8re, B. 1966. Fouilles de Clysma-Qolzoum (Suez): 1930\u20131932.
