The sherd belongs to the group of Chian black figured vases bearing Laconising features. According to Williams, the kylix is by the same painter as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.133.2 and AN1896-1908-G.133.6, whom he has identified as the Sirens Painter. The Sirens Painter pieces most closely resemble those by the Boreads Painter, primarily because of the single pomegranate band on the tondo of the Oxford kylix."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
