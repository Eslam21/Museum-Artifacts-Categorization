{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6834", "Dating": "NAQADA", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "PALETTE", "Material": "SCHIST", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "33 cm", "Width": "10 cm", "Name": "Rhombic cosmetic palette", "Description": "This large, rhombic greywacke cosmetic palette, intact except for one broken tip, bears extremely fine engravings of animals on both sides, probably dogs hunting antelopes and/or gazelles.  Such desert hunting scenes are common in Predynastic and later iconography, including incised representations on pottery from the Naqada I Period (see E.2631). They are perhaps a symbol for the triumph of order over chaos and consequently may also have a political-religious connotation. It is unusual to find such decoration on a cosmetic palette, but certainly not unique."}
