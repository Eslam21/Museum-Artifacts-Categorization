This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The collection of F. W. von Bissing holds a significant group of figures in glazed composition mainly dating to the late Ptolemaic (maybe extending to the early Roman), in a few cases earlier. They often depict more Greek themes, though not always. The Naukratite origin of this lot, which ended in the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, appears dubious. The same can be said of the bronzes from this collection. ", " This figure is of a completely different faience from the earlier material from Naukratis, and is also in a very good state of preservation. Other Ptolemaic and later faience pieces are registered as from Naukratis, including the very fine head of Arsinoe II. This however, was acquired during the excavations.
