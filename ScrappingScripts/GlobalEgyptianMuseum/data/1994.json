Their contents vary across time, but include materials used in construction. In the 18th Dynasty temple for the cult of queen Hatshepsut as Pharaoh, they include wooden rockers, of uncertain function; no full-scale example has survived, but presumably they were used in the construction of the terraced stone temple of Hatshepsut."}
