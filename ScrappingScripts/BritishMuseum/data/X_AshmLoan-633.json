", " Lemos places this sherd in Group E of the Sphinx and Lion Style. The vases in this group are the latest in the series of the Sphinx and Lion Style and the execution of the imagery is done in a hurried manner with no attention to detail. The figures are sketchy and, in some cases, difficult to identify. Lemos also places this sherd in Stage 1 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless and the rosettes clumsy, but soince there is no rosette on this sherd, it is difficult to place it in Group D. As Group E marks a deterioration of the style, even if the imagery on the sherd is restricted, the sherd might best be placed in Lemos's Group E.
