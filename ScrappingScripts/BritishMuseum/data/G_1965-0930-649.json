The rim finds parallels with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) Type 10 South Ionian cups but the body does not. Furthermore, the junction of the rim and body are bevelled and this is not typical of the shape. Finally, the angle of the bowl finds its closest parallels in Hayes' Ionian Cup Type IV (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), a type which is not (otherwise) observed at Naukratis."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.254) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.649"]}
