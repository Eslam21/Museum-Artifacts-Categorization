{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 31408", "Dating": "MERENPTAH/BAENRE", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF MERENPTAH", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "318 cm", "Width": "163 cm", "Name": "Stela of King Merenptah", "Description": "King Merenptah, the thirteenth son and successor of King Ramesses the Second, reused the back face of this gray granite stela. The stela was originally erected by King Amenhotep the Third in his mortuary temple on the west bank of Thebes. The round top of this face, topped by the winged sun disk and flanked by the cartouches of Merenptah, is divided into two parts. Each part shows King Merenptah before the god Amun and followed by the other members of the Theban triad, the god Khonsu on the right and goddess Mut on the left. Under this scene, a hymn consisting of 28 lines commemorates Merenptah's victory over the Libyans in his fifth regnal year. In the final strophe of the hymn, Merenptah mentions various entities that he had subdued. In the middle of line 27 of this text appears the name Israel inscribed in hieroglyphs. The name refers to the people and not to the state, like other localities mentioned on the stela. The occurrence of this word indicated to some scholars that this king is the pharaoh of the Exodus but there is no evidence to prove that."}
