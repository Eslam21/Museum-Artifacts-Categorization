{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1892:224", "Dating": "1ST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK ?", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; PAINTED", "Height": "38 cm", "Width": "80 cm", "Name": "Stela of Hetepneb", "Description": "This stela provides an excellent illustration of the development of Egyptian art during periods of weak central kingship, when local workshops produced formal monuments with hieroglyphic inscriptions without the controls of rigorous royal or temple sculptural training. The figures of Hetepneb, a local administrator, and his wife, and the cutting of the hieroglyphs are in the provincial style typical of the area north of Thebes during the 1st Intermediate Period. In the left margin outside the framing rectangle may be seen a small incised figure of a man, possibly a 'signature' of the sculptor or an addition by a later hand."}
