Another similar tablet (1924,0510.24) contains a duplicate of the same text in demotic only with a continuation that records the dedicator's good works for the temple. The tablet was a votive offering, a dedication of precious metal and a permanent record of the donor's piety. It seems to have been damaged by fire, perhaps in a deliberate attempt to melt it down.
