The fragments of the B7.4 cup show a wing and snakes, a combination that makes possible the suggestion that the subject was Typhon, although the work is too fragmentary to allow certain identification. There are some obscure points as well, for example that wings are not a common feature for a sea-daemon. From the little that is left of B7.4, however, a reconstruction is almost impossible, so the question of form and identity must be left open.
