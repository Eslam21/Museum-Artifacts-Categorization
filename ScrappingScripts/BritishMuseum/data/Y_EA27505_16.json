XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of this pylon provided several rectangular plaques made in various materials- notably different metals and stones, as well as fragments of raw material, such as lapis lazuli and turquoise. Three plaques in glazed composition, like this one, were also discovered: one in the north-east corner, one in the south-west one and one in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. XXV no. 20). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-west corner of the pylon. The object is marked in pencil \"NW\", confirming its context of discovery. Petrie considered it to represent 'that material (green glazed sandy ware) used for decorations' (Petrie 1886, 29). In the frame of a foundation deposit, faience plaques can also act a symbolic or magical substitute material (on large and inscribed faience bricks from a Ramesses II foundation deposit in Qantir see: Weinstein 1973, 244-7, 254-257).
