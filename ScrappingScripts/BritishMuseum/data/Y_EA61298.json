{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA61298"], "Description": [" A plaque with a figure of Bes standing, wielding a sword in his raised right hand, the weapon crossing the feathers of his crown. In his lowered left hand he grips a snake round its neck, and the coils of its body curve around his arm. He appears to be wearing a muscle-cuirass with a double lower border, with no under-tunic or pteryges, but he may be naked with a low-slung belt: the former is more probable. His tail is shown hanging vertically between his legs. Most of the feathers of his crown, apparently six in number, are broken away and lost, together with the tip of his sword. The back is rough and un-worked. The plaque is solid and was pressed into a one-piece mould. Orange-brown, micaceous Nile silt.
