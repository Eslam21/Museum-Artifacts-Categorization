", " Lamb identifies the sherd as coming from a pyxis and Lemos suggests it comes from a stemmed bowl. However, the lack of a slip on the interior (a slip would be expected on pyxides, bowls and skyphos kraters) points more closely to Chian dinoi which are typically unslipped on their interior. For parallels with other dinoi, see British Museum 1888,0601.459. For parallels regarding the decorative scheme, see Oxford AN1896-1908-G.120.17. Lemos places this sherd in Group C of the Sphinx and Lion Style. The vases in this group may all have been decorated by the same painter. The cogwheel rosettes have more spikes and the figures are well executed. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
