{"artifact_name": "stool", "Object Type": ["stool"], "Museum number": ["EA2482"], "Description": [" Three-legged wooden stool: painted white. The semicircular dished seat resembles a wide saddle. Formed from a solid block of wood, it shows a distinct front edge, to which three legs are oriented, two in the front, one at the rear. Shouldered socket joints connect the legs to the underside of the seat. The splayed curve of the legs, which firmly anchors the stool, was achieved naturally with the use of forked branches. These were rounded with draw knives, rasps, and scrapers.
