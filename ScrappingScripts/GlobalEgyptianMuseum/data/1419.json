In his left hand he holds a bunch of grapes, his right arm hangs by his side, grasping a funerary garland in his hand. His hairstyle closely follows the shape of his skull, and is very short with small curls. The rounded, almost child-like, face, the large almond-shaped eyes and the soft smile point to the art of the Coptic Period."}
