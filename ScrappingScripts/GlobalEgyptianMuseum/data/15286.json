{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 56", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "47 cm", "Name": "Statue of the Scribe Maa-Nefer", "Description": "The statue of the scribe Maa-Nefer shows us an idealized image of an Egyptian official. The statue shows him seated with his legs crossed with a partly unrolled papyrus on his knees. He wears a wig, the locks of which are thrown back over the shoulders leaving the ears free. He has a very attentive expression on his face, as if listening to his master. A large wide collar with green beads adorns his chest and a fine mustache is drawn above the lips. His name is written on the base of the statue. Because the position of scribe was highly respected, a great number of tomb owners had themselves depicted in a scribal pose, reading or writing."}
