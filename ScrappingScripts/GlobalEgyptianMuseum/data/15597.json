{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63793", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; PAINTED; DRAWING", "Width": "14.8 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of Two Bulls Fighting", "Description": "There are few drawings that depict a fight between two bulls in the history of ancient Egyptian art. Here, two bulls crash horns in combat. The bull on the left stands on its hooftips; the one on the right moves its head slightly. The drawing does not convey the heat of battle between such powerful animals and the proportions of the bulls do not show their essential weight and strength. This means that the drawing was probably the work of a beginner who has made a trial animal drawing."}
