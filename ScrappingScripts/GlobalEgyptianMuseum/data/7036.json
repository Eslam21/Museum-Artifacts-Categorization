First called ''hand-axe'', it was later labelled ''coup de poing'' (in French) but now, it is simply referred to as a biface since it has been fashioned on both surfaces. This evades any debate about its actual function, which is not entirely clear. Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons it is thought that it was used as a knife and, possibly, as a scraper."}
