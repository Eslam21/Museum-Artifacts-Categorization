", " Base form with parallels from Ptolemaic (Nenna and Seif el-Din 2000, no. 202, late 4th century BC ) and Roman Egypt (Tomber 2006, 48, Fig. 1.16). The base is uneven. The pale green glaze could be more consistent with a Ptolemaic date, rather than the standard rich turquoise of early Roman production at Memphis. Closest Ptolemaic parallels are from small bowls, particulaly the echinus type dated to the 3rd to 2nd or 1st centuries BC (Nena 2013, Fig. 6.2, T3.1a-c).
