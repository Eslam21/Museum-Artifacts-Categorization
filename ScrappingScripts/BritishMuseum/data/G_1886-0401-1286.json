According to Lemos, possibly, a woman taking part in a komos scene is depicted. The main vase of this group is a chalice in St. Petersburg from Berezan (Lemos 1991, no. 964) which has the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily, and carelessly, in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black-figure. However, none of these features are visible on British Museum 1886,0401.1286. Whilst all that is visible of the female figure is her chiton, it is not depicted in outline (although her arm is, but this is a technique commonly found on Grand Style vases). Furthermore, the interior decoration is more elaborate than the usual Simple Animal Style decoration. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
