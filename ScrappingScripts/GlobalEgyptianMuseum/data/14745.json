{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 28942", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "QURNET MURA`I", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "DECORATED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "58 cm", "Name": "Painted Jar with the Relief of a Horse", "Description": "This painted jar, with a pointed base and a slightly thickened rim, is the type of vessel from which wine or beer was served at banquets. Bands in black and red decorate the jar just below the neck, at the shoulder, and near the bottom. Between the last two sets of bands is a scene of a spotted horse running towards the right, which is repeated all around the body of the jar. The animal's body and tail have black and red patches, while the head is decorated with two tall feathers, outlined in red. The long red rope drawn in front of the horse suggests that the animal is probably a tame one."}
