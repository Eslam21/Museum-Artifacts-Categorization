{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86776"], "Description": [" Almost complete fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. It also shows a blackened area, probably from fire. The rear shows a small area with wooden fibres, probably from a bolt or a box knob, roughly perpendicular to this two impressions of a turned cord with a width of approximately 0.25 cm. Another part of the rear is slightly concave in shape (from a knob?). The front side is convex and is covered in finger impressions. It shows an impression of a seal that seems to have been in the shape of a square cross with rounded ends. The motif shows a spiral pattern filling the complete seal.
