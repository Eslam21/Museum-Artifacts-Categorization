In the upper register on the right the standard of the god Wepwawet is carried on the shoulders of eleven (?) priests. In front of the standard are the w\u2018b-priest Amenmose, and Pentawer with their arms raised in adoration. Behind them are carved the figures of four wolves. In the second register Patawer is kneeling on the right pouring a libation before an altar covered with offerings. On the left a jackal-headed god is squatting and another jackal is seated on a pedestal. The text contains a prayer to Anubis. In the main part of the lower register a ram-headed god stands on the right before an altar heaped with food offerings. On the left stands Wepwawet in human form with a wolf's head. He is spearing a crocodile which is carved below the level of the register and is chasing a human figure whose head projects above the border into the register. Behind Wepwawet are carved the figures of three wolves. The stela shows some surface wear. There are no traces of colour.
