It shows a sporting competition of boatmen in a small stream or pond full of water lilies. These types of nautical games were performed in the presence of the master and his family when they visit their estate in the Delta marshes. The game, which is portrayed with realism and animation, shows men wrestling and using long poles with forked ends to strike at their opponents. One of the men has fallen into the water; another helps to drag him back on board. It should be noted that the artist has recorded the men's cries and dialog."}
