It is in the form of a canopic jar. Such jars were used in place of more conventional burial. A study in the Greco-Roman Museum in Alexandria made it clear that the way in which the ashes are placed in the urn was of great importance, as the arrangement started with the bones of the feet and ended with the skull. This jar is one of the types of funerary containers that have been found in Alexandria; the most well known of which is one that is called the \"hydria.\""}
