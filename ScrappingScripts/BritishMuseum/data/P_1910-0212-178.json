This shows the kneeling figure of David to the left, with the head of Goliath that can still be made out in the lower left corner of the present sheet.[1] The subject was treated only once by Rembrandt himself, in the early painting of 1627 now in Basel (Bredius 488, Corpus A9). The drawing displays a knowledge of Rembrandt's historical and biblical compositions of the 1650s (such as the 'David receiving the News of Uriah's Death' in the Rijksmuseum, Benesch 890) and the most plausible attribution hitherto has been to Aert de Gelder.[2] Yet the style is significantly different to that of the only drawing that may be attributed to de Gelder with confidence, the 'Group of Orientals' in the Abrams Collection at the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass. (Sumowski 1052). The connection with Willem Drost is suggested in particular by its analogies with a drawing in the Rijksmuseum that is now ascribed to him, the 'Parable of the unmerciful Servant' (Sumowski 567xx). This exhibits a similarly liberal use of parallel shading; the figures in profile towards the right of both compositions as well as the heads of the figures in the centre, immediately to the main protagonist's left in both sheets, are also comparable.[3] The drawings should probably be dated during Drost's early maturity, around 1655. The contention that the two children holding Saul's mantle were added by Rembrandt has rightly been rejected, as this passage displays the same penmanship as the more loosely drawn sections on the right.[4] The motif, however, does occur in Rembrandt's painting of the subject noted above. NOTES: [1] The subject was correctly identified by Sumowski, 1962 (see Lit. below). The Braunschweig drawing is inv. no.Z.1614 (pen and brown ink with brown wash, 199 x 313; see Exh. Braunschweig, 2006, cat. no.6). [2] As suggested by Sumowski, 1981 (see Lit. below). [3] Sumowski's tentative attribution of the Rijksmuseum's drawing (which he considered a copy) to Drost has been supported by Schatborn, 1985, pp.100-101, with fig.12. In 1962, Sumowski placed the present drawing in the group around the 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' in the British Museum (Drost, cat. no.1, 1895,0915.1255), noting that some of the drawings concerned had been given to Drost by Pont, 1960. [4] Benesch advanced the theory (1957); it was rejected by Sumowski (1961).
