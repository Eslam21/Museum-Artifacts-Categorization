The monkey moves forward, loaded with two potbellied urns which it will empty on the squared fields. Two palm-trees extend  green leaves and red fruits at the edge of the field. The ridiculous character of the scene is emphasized by the presence of a child perched on the shoulder of the monkey. Armed with a short baton, it tries to touch the fruits directly."}
