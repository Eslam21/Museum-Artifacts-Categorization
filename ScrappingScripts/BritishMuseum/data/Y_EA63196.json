{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA63196"], "Description": [" Thin ivory oval plaque: probably the terminal piece for the butt-end of an axe-haft. It is pierced with small holes to form a decorative pattern composed of a number of triangles, several of which are joined at the apices. Most of the holes contain a dark inlay or adhesive. It is cracked down the middle and the surface is worn in several places. The reverse of the plaque is discoloured by brown stains, which are concentrated around the holes.
