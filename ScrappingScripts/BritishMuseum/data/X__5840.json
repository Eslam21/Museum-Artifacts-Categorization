", " Bronze figures of Harpokrates were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods in Egypt (Weiss 2012, 126-157, Typ 41-69, Pl. 11-19), chiefly in the Delta where his cult was particularly developed (Sandri 2006). Likewise, the child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). This figure of Harpokrates is a variant of the type 58 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, particularly well attested in Late Period contexts of the Memphite region and in Athribis (Weiss 2012, 145-146, 603-606, Pl. 16g-h and 17a-b). A close simplistic rendering of the child god can be found on an example from North Saqqara (Davies, Smith 2005, 124, pl. LXV b; Weiss 2012, 594, Pl. 15, Nr. 281). For a similarly flat rendering of a bronze from Naukratis, see for example Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.261.
