Brunton, \u2018Mostagedda and the Tasian Culture\u2019 (London, 1937), 85), and although this particular string was found at the wrists the excavators believed it might have been placed there after death (Ibid.). On the other hand, calcite pendants seem to have been found exclusively at the wrists. However, there is no evidence in the primary report (op. cit, 73) that the two alabaster drops found at the wrists in this burial were attached to the string in question. Indeed, the other drop pendant (1930,0711.107) was on its own string. Consequently, although the calcite pendant in this entry entered the collection already strung with the beads, there is no clear evidence that it was so discovered. Also from this burial: bracelet (1930,0711.106) and pendant on a cord (1930,0711.107). Bibliography: G.
