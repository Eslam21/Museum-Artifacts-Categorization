The back is hollow, but details are hidden by the modern plaster used to mount the object on a stand. Hand-modelled, with incised detail, and the hair added. White plaster containing some grains of sand; red paint within the mouth, in one of the ears, and in the hair. An ancient cream-coloured plaster occupies some of the hollow at the back, but its extent cannot now be seen.
