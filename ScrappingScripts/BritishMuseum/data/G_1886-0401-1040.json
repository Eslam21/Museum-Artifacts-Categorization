According to Cook, decoration on underside of the vessel is exceptional in Fikellura. Cook points out that the various design features on the oinochoe are related to earlier patterns. for instance, the ribbon pattern is found on Middle Corinthian vases (595BC-570BC). and the stalked rosette is found on Pre-Fikellura vases from the Plain Body Group (575BC-550BC). Still, he prefers to see a mid-6th century date for this oinochoe."], "Bibliographic references": [" CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (p. 7, no. 5, pl. 6, no. 5) ", " Cook 1933-1934 / Fikellura Pottery (pp. 43-4, no. 3, pl. 16c) ", " Walter-Karydi 1973 / Samische Gef\u00e4sse des 6.
