Within the naos, the deity Ptah is shown in the shape of a mummy. He is bearded and is holding scepters. Neferebre-Nefer wears a long wig that reaches his shoulders. His skirt has a pleated frontal section. Offering formulas to the god Ptah of Memphis and the god Sokar are carved on the sides of the naos, the base, and the back pillar. The titles of Neferebre-Nefer are also given: \"The soul friend of the Beloved One and Overseer of the chambers of Atum, the mayor and hereditary prince, the Seal bearer of Lower Egypt and Beloved of the King, the two eyes and two ears of the King.\" Statues of a person holding a naos had been placed in temples from the New Kingdom to the Late Period. This allowed the donor to symbolically participate in the offerings brought for the god and to receive the god's protection."}
