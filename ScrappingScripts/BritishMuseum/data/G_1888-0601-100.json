Cypriote Ptah figurines are simplified from Egyptian ones. Good parallels from three Amathus tombs (Karageorghis 1996, 14, pl.8.3 Type D(b)1; Murray, Smith & Walters 1900, 113-4, fig. 165.4). Breitenstein gives an early date of 700-500BC (1941, pl.5.44), Karageorghis a broad date of 600-475BC (1996,14) and Fourrier & Queyrel a later date of 525-450BC for their parallels made at Kition and Larnaca (1998, 316-7, 351, nos 510-512, 565-6, AM739, MNB130, AM3737, AM46 and N3310). Gjerstad suggests this Egyptianising Eastern Neo-Cypriote style (570 to 520 BC) \u2018certainly transmitted via the Cypriote sculpture activity in Naukratis' (Gjerstad 1948, 470). The findspot 'Hera' is scratched onto the back of the figure's head; he British Museum register does not specify the findspot. Breitenstein, N. 1941.
