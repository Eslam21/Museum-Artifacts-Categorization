He had a large mastaba at Saqqara from which came 11 engraved wooden panels. These covered the rear walls of niches that were carved in the west wall of his tomb. Hesire held important positions, such as Chief of the Royal Scribes, the Greatest of the Tens of Upper Egypt, Chief of Buto, and Chief Dentist. The six best-preserved panels are now on exhibit in the Egyptian Museum. They show Hesire in different positions and at various ages. Hieroglyphic inscriptions give his names and titles. In all these scenes, the artist succeeded in showing the fine details of the hieroglyphs. He also rendered the exact facial features of the man at different stages of his life as well as the detailed modeling of his body."}
