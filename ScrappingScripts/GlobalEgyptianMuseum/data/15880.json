{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 99166", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; RELIEF", "Height": "43 cm", "Width": "23 cm", "Name": "Funerary Stela of Unknown Woman", "Description": "For a long time, large numbers of specific monuments containing inscriptions and scenes were discovered, either in tombs, or in the domains of gods. These monuments, called stelae, were made of either stone or wood. The stelae, which were originally associated with the tombs, were architecturally designed to be topped by pyramidions, or small pyramids. They became very popular during the Ramesside period. On this stela, the pyramidion is decorated at the top by the hieroglyphic Shen sign, symbolizing power and universal duration. Next, come two depictions of the Udjat eye as a symbol of protection. The stela itself shows in its upper register, or section, a woman, presumably the owner of the monument, standing before a sumptuously laid table on which are displayed various kinds of offerings. Worshiping Osiris, she wears a long dress and a long thick wig topped by a cone of perfumed ointment of the kind worn at banquets and on other festive occasions. Osiris is shown sitting on his throne, wearing the Atef Crown and holding the Heka scepter and flail. Behind the seated god, stands the goddess Nephthys. On the second register, the lady of the stela is depicted seated and receiving the offerings presented to her by members of her family. This stela is unfinished, and the name of its owner has never been inscribed on it."}
