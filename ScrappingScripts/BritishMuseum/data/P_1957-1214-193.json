The Rest on the Flight to Egypt was a subject that Claude depicted on multiple occasions across his career, and the present composition develops from the one he painted in 1661 for van Halmale (see 1957,1214.160). The related painting, which was last recorded in the collection of the Viscount Coke at Holkham Hall, is of reduced dimensions being 37 x 47 cm and which accounts for the simplification of various details (Roethlisberger 1986, no. 265). It was commissioned by Muzio Massimi and is the only painting owned by this Roman Conservatore, even though his relative Cardinal Massimi had commissioned two more ambitious works from Claude (see 1957,1215.188). The increased sense of serenity and the emphasis on recessional depth in the present drawing are also typical of Claude\u2019s late career. The handling in this drawing is delicate with the penstrokes swirling and broken and the grey wash added sparingly. Lit: M.
