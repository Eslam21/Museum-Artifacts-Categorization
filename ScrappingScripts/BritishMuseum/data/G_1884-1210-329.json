Warren, S. Brown and others in the vicinity of the church of Ayios Ermogenis, some of the finds from which apparently came to the British Museum in 1884 (see Myres & Ohnefalsch-Richter 1899, 6-7 for details of work at Kourion in the later 19th century; Merrillees and Kiely forthcoming). Laffineur, in his survey of jewellery from Amathus (1986, 97-8), identifies this combination of a plaited hoop with a raised setting, as an isolated variety. However the only example cited, from Marion Tomb 9 (see SCE IV/3, fig. 36, 2), is somewhat different to the current example, having a more slender hoop and a rectangular box.
