{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.4990", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURE VASE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; ENGOBE", "Height": "22.5 cm", "Depth": "3.2 cm", "Name": "Vase in a female form", "Description": "This ceramic object is in reality a vase which takes the form of a woman. Represented naked, the figure bears traces of polychromy which emphasize the base of the abdomen and attest the presence of a necklace at the nape of the neck and bracelets at the top of the elbows. Also very characteristic is the wig with several locks rendered in a pattern of thick curl . The vase, of which the opening is found at the top of the head, must probably be situated in the context of feminine figurines of fertility (see E.2527 and E.2844)."}
