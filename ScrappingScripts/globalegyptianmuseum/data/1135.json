In the main register, one sees the wife of the owner and his son, in adoration before the Theban triad. The figure of Amun, seated upon a raised throne, and the symbols which accompany it, form a sort of rebus which states a common epithet of the god: \"Amun who is at the head of the gods\". The second register contains a hymn which is written in horizontal lines, interrupted at regular intervals by vertical columns in which the names and titles of Amonmose and members of his family are written."}
