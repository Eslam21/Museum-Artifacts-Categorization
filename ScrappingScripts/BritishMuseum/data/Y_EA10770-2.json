Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains a magical text for protection for the epagomenal days at the turn of the year and other matters, and on the verso there is a continuation of this text. The text is written in horizontal with some vertical lines. This frame contains Fragments A-D. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
