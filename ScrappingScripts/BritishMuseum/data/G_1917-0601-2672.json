The upper part of the ornament is a crescentic plaque with a symmetrical series of volutes below, formed of repouss\u00e9-gold sheet. An S-shaped hook is soldered to the back and the wire runs up to support a bead within the horns of the crescent. Hanging from three loops, which are attached behind the volutes, are wires covered by narrow cones of sheet gold, and terminating in beads. One of the suspended beads is hollow glass. The other beads appear to be pearls.
