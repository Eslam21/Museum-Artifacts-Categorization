{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA13596"], "Description": [" Ivory figure of dog with bronze fish in mouth: a superbly carved puppy wearing a collar which shows traces of gilding, with lop ears and long bushy tail which curls around its hind quarters, adopts the well-known posture of a dog at play with front legs bent and rump raised in the air. From its mouth protrudes a flat triangular piece of bronze with a notched end which is presumably intended to represent the tail of a fish he has just swallowed, although it might equally be a fly which he is just about to gobble down. The plinth is broken.
