Parallel of the Sphinx from the Archaic Sanctuary of Ayia Irini (Karageorghis 1996, 9, fig. 8) is probably earlier than this example, as this is more naturalistic in its execution. Egyptianising Eastern Neo-Cypriote style that Gjerstad states was \u2018certainly transmitted via the Cypriote sculpture activity in Naukratis' (Gjerstad 1948, 470) that he dates to around 570 to 520 BC, and certainly within the Cypro-Archaic II period of 600-450 BC.
