Though the hieroglyphic signs on its underside could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this was meant as cryptic writing for the name of Amun / Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) associated with the Horus name of Psamtek II, Menekhib. Variants of such inscription appears on a few scarabs from the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 96-97, see especially 97 for this piece; on the various productions from the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). The Horus name of Psamtek II, sometimes written in a abbreviated way, is a very common inscription on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids (said to be men-ib-Ra in Gorton 1996, 93 and 111, but is actually Menekhib).
