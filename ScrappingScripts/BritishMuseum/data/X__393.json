McCann precises that square lug handles are common on stone vessels of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (in Goddio 2008, 258). The mortar with its very characteristic handles resembles also dishes in slate typical of the Late Third Intermediate and Late Periods (mainly 25th and 26th dynasties according to Aston 1994, 164-165. For dishes from a late 26th-early 27th dynasty context in Karnak see: Anus and Sa\u2019ad 1971, 233, fig. 18; Masson forthcoming. For examples of the Third Intermediate Period from Herakleopolis Magna: Molinero 1995, 212, pl. LXIX j, pl. LXX g, pl. LXXI, pl. LXXVI). Such dishes however are usually finer in execution. Other mortars of similar shape were discovered in Naukratis: Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4552 and AN1896-1908-E.4553.
