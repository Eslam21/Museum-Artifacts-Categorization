", " This object was not yet seen. At least six foundation deposits were discovered in Ptolemy II gateway of the Great Temenos, one at each of the four corners and one at the northwest and southwest corners of a central hall (Petrie 1886, 28-31, pl. XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of this pylon provided several rectangular plaques made in various materials- notably different metals and stones. No less than five different metals are represented: gold, silver, lead, copper and iron. Two samples of silver, like this one, were discovered: one in the north-east corner and one in the south-east one (Petrie 1886, 30-31, pl. XXV no. 23). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-east corner of the pylon. It is usual in Ptolemaic foundation deposits of that type that several uninscribed plaques of a wide variety of materials are discovered and associated to only a few cartouche-shaped inscribed plaques (Weinstein 1973, 359-360).
