{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 27211", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "CUBIT ROD", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; LOW RELIEF", "Name": "Cubit Measuring Rod of Sennedjem", "Description": "The well-preserved measuring rod belongs to the artisan Sennedjem. It measures 52.5 centimeters and was a piece of construction equipment. It might be directly or indirectly related to Sennedjem, since he worked in construction. The measuring rod is considered to be a votive object and it was placed in the tomb with the funeral furniture. Because of its good condition, it was most probably not used in Sennedjem's life, but was a copy of a real measuring rod that was placed in the tomb for his use in the afterlife. The incised line of hieroglyphic inscriptions contains an offering formula for the god Ptah, so that \"he might grant a beautiful life in the West, cool water, wine and milk, to the Ka of Sennedjem, true of voice.\""}
