All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 93). The lack of decoration on the interior surface of the sherd suggests that the sherd may be earlier and belong in the Wild Goat Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
