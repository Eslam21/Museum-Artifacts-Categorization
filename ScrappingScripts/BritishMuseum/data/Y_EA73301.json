{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA73301"], "Description": [" Copper alloy lamp: deep flat-topped, elongated rounded body tapering to a flaring nozzle-end, with an oval dished area round an almost circular wick-hole. Raised rim round the filling-hole, with hinge-pieces at the front holding a truncated circular lamp-lid; remains of an iron pin survive. At the rear is a further pair of hinge-pieces which holds a scallop-shell-shaped reflector ornament (1919,0505.775), behind which is an angular handle with a circular piercing and a strut above supporting the ornament. The scallops radiate from a raised triangular element decorated with an incised branch; below the triangle is a splayed tongue with a projecting pierced lug that allows the handle-ornament to fold forward and rest on top of the lamp. On each side of the handle-ornament the lowest lobe has a projecting lug, one of which is pierced for a chain now lost. On the side of the body is an incised C-shaped sigma (shown at full size on the plate). The lamp stands on a high flaring base with mouldings round the bottom, hollow within and with a square-sectioned socket for the spike of a lampstand. This socket, the sleeve of which is cylindrical with a domed top, rises inside the oil-chamber. Surface colouration: cleaned to bare metal.

Compare, in addition, two lamps in the Coptic Museum, Cairo, the folding-forward lids of which are in the form of shallow domes, rather than a scallop-shell: Inv. Nos 1285 and 5186; the dome of the latter is decorated with an openwork pattern; also with a domed folding-forward lid is a lamp closely similar to ours in the Allard Pierson Museum, Inv. No. 8018.
