{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2291"], "Description": [" Steatite statue of Meryptah: a small black steatite statue of a kneeling man adoring the cartouche of Ramses II. The right-facing inscription in Middle Egyptian on the statue's back pillar identifies him as Meryptah. Meryptah's arms are raised in adoration of a cartouche. A figure of the goddess Maat ('Truth') writes m\u0292't; she wears her hieroglyphic emblem on her head, and holds in her hand the hieroglyph 'wsr', which represents an animal-headed staff. As often, the cartouche rests on a sign for gold, and wears a royal headdress of plumes and sun-disk; it is flanked by two hieroglyphs for 'year' (now broken), evoking a long reign for the king. The top of the plaque containing the cartouche has been broken off. The two arms of the statue have been worn or cut smooth resulting in the loss of the cartouche on the right side. There are traces of white paint in the hieroglyphs and on the wig and gown.
