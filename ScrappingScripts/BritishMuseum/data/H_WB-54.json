Commentary: The loop handles of this lamp are designed to that it can be hung in the sanctuary of a mosque (an example in the V&A ((inv. no. 1056-1869)) still has its original metal hanging chains from c 1340). Lamps of this type are often painted with inscriptions from the Qur'an, or with the name or arms of the sultan or other official who dedicated them. This lamp is made in the name of an unknown sultan, as the inscription translates: 'Glory to our Lord the sultan, the king, the wise, the just, the warrior'. Most of the surviving lamps have been found in the mosques of Jerusalem and Damascus, as well as in Konya and the Yemen. They became desirable collector's pieces in 19th century Europe, particularly amongst the Rothschild family. Solomon de Rothschild owned two examples now in the Louvre (inv. nos. OA 7568 & OA 7567) and another was acquired and exhibited by Baron Gustave Rothschild at a Paris exhibition in 1869, an inexact copy of which by Philippe Joseph-Brocard, dated 1867, is now in the British Museum (reg. no. 1902,1118.1).
