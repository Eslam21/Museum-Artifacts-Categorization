This is one of the largest sets. Most were arrow heads with a transversal cutting edge. In other words, the bevelled rectilinear side of the head was perpendicular to the shaft and assured contact and impact. The circular side, the back of the head, was directly fitted to a hard wooden shaft, which was set in the stalk of a reed. Occasionally, other heads were placed right under the main arrow head, on either side of the shaft (with the cant parallel to the shaft this time), thus creating a barbed arrow. These were fixed to the wood with a dark bronze-green adhesive."}
