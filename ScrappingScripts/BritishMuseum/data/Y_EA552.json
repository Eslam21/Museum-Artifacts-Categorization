{"artifact_name": "pilaster", "Object Type": ["pilaster"], "Museum number": ["EA552"], "Description": [" Limestone pilaster from Horemheb's first tomb: showing the generalissimo with his hands raised in prayer. The prayer of this figure, which faced east, is offered to the traditional sun god, Ra, in his rising; while that on the opposite side, above his figure facing west, is to Osiris, Foremost god of the West . Horemheb wears an extremely elaborate court costume, typical of the late Eighteenth Dynasty: a long, elaborate crimped and curled double wig, to which the uraeus was added, and several layers of clothing - all of it, apparently, in diaphanous pleated linen. Over a shirt with wide, floppy sleeves there seem to be at least two kilts, from one of which hangs a long pointed front panel indicating Horemheb's military status. Fastened to a shoulder strap and hanging down his back is a fan made from a single ostrich plume, insignia of Horemheb's exalted role as \"Fan Bearer on the Right of the King\" - that is, one who had access to the king's person. Horemheb's sandaled feet are rendered identically. His face is sweet-looking with his large, heavy-lidded eye, his rather plump, bottom-heavy figure, and his spindly limbs. Faint traces red and blue paint are still visible. The pilaster has been reassembled from the four pieces into which it was broken.
