{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a female worshipper carrying a bird for sacrifice. Upper body (without head) carved from white limestone female figure, standing, wearing chiton and oblique cloak; painted.The head and lower body from about calf level are missing. Continuous break at waist. Parts broken off especially around the right elbow and the cloth hanging down from the left elbow. Red band at lower border of the cloak, particularly well articulated on the back. The garment on the right side of the upper body is painted red, the border of the painted area runs diagonally across the chest.The woman is wearing a long-sleeved garment with kolpos below which in the centre of the skirt a bundle of folds falls down vertically. The right arm is slightly too slim and short and holds with its small hand a bird around the centre of the body. The left arm is lightly bent, the hand lies with a stretched out thumb on the lower body thus partially covering the folds. Considering the red paint, this figure probably wore a cloak slung around the body obliquely. Parts of the cloth are hanging down from the left and right elbows which belong to a cloak. Which runs along the edge of the arms and shoulders and laid on the head as a veil. On the back it runs obliquely from calf level up. The back is flat on the level of the upper body but slightly more rounded elsewhere. The hemline of the cloak is stepped.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This figure and Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.4.1899 (Nick 2006, cat. 42) belong to a separate group of draped female figures. Both wear a garment with a central bundle of folds on top of which an oblique mantle ('Schr\u00e4gm\u00e4ntelchen') is draped \u2013 in this figure the mantle is painted on. They both wear a veil, which reaches down from the head, covering the back, to the calves; its hemline is visible at the sides. A similar veil is worn by the Kourotrophos (Nick 2006, cat. 55) from Naukratis. Cypriot draped female figures with an oblique mantle are not known from Samos or Lindos, which confirms the date suggested by Yon for the introduction of the Greek Kore as after the mid sixth century. The girdle of this figure is covered by the Kolpos; here the left hand does not reach for the cloth of the garment but lies flat on the lower body while the right holds up a bird in front of the chest. In contrast, the broad girdle of the Cambridge figure shows below the Kolpos: the left arm hangs down while the right hand is placed on the chest in a gesture of veneration. Nick 2006, cat. 41, p. 119, pl. 18; pp. 59-64. ", " Faint pencil mark \u03a63 (Sanctuary of Aphrodite context 3). Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B). A separate and later group, to which this piece belongs, of draped Cypriot female figure plaques wear a chiton with a central bundle of folds on top of which an oblique mantle ('Schr\u00e4gm\u00e4ntelchen') is draped, (Nick 2006, N41-22, Type 2.1e; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.4.1899; Boston MFA 88.736 and unpublished piece Boston MFA 11.45976). They usually wear a veil, which reaches down from the head, covering the back, to the calves; its hemline is visible at the sides as seen on the Naukratis Kourotrophos (Nick 2006, N55). This type is not known from Samos or Lindos, leading Nick to follow Yon\u2019s arguement (1974) for the introduction of the Greek Kore as after the mid sixth century (Nick 2006, 59-64, 119, cat. 41, pl. 18). It is not is not attested in 620/600BC-570/560BC deposits, so a later date of 560-525BC is suggested, following Nick\u2019s dating. These were found in Saite period layers deposited before 525BC.
