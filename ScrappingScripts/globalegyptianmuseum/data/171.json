Its archaic style allows it to be dated to the beginning of the 3rd Dynasty. The standard conventions of Egyptian statuary are already clearly in use here. The symmetry of the face and the wig is perfect. The left arm is folded across the chest, the right arm is stretched out close to the body and the legs are close together. The 'lady' is dressed in a long robe which hugs her figure."}
