{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7067", "Dating": "EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD (not before); EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD ?; EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "IVORY", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "2.4 cm", "Name": "Ivory boat with bird figures", "Description": "This sickle-shaped ivory boat has five bird figures on its deck. Four of them are all looking in the same direction and are probably falcons. The last bird in the row has a longer neck and appears to be another type, perhaps a water bird. It is facing the other way but this may be the result of mistaken restoration. This is very probably a royal vessel or a divine bark. We should perhaps look for a connection with the later divine bark of the divinity Sokar, the so-called henu-bark, whose forecastle is also decorated with a row of birds (falcons or swallows)."}
