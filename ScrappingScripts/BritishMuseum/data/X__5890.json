", " This figure was discovered in a large cache of bronzes in Teh el-Barud, a settlement located closeby Naukratis (Gardner 1888, 81; Weiss 2012, 445-446; Masson forthcoming), though the museum's register states that it was found in Naukratis. According to Griffith, Amun holds a scimitar in his hand (Gardner 1888, 81), but this type of object is usually held by other deities such as Mahes, son of Bastet (Weiss 2012, Typ 106, Pl. 29 and 73). This would either mean that this is an unusual bronze figure of Amun (on more normal type: Weiss 2012, Typ 24, Pl. 7) or that this is a wrong identification for the deity or the object that he holds. The figure would need to be properly cleaned to precise the identification. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis. Part II (Sixth Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund), London.
