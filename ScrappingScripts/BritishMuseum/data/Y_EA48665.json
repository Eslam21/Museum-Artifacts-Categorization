{"artifact_name": "figure; trial-piece", "Object Type": [" figure ", " trial-piece "], "Museum number": ["EA48665"], "Description": [" Limestone bust of a royal figure, likely a sculptor\u2019s model or trial piece. The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth, set low on the forehead and with the material tucked behind the ears. The smooth lappets extend down past the shoulders and reach to his chest. An ornament depicting a cobra\u2019s coiled body is placed at the centre of the nemes above the forehead. There is no indication of clothing across the figure\u2019s chest area, however the nipples have been outlined. The eyes are wide and almond shaped, with thin incised lines denoting the eyelids and short cosmetic lines which emerge from the outer corners of the eyes. The thin eyebrows slope down slightly towards the temples and the nose broadens out at the nostrils, with a clear cupid\u2019s bow detailed above the upper lip. The mouth is wide with thick lips, with the lower lip sharply incised and the outer corners of the mouth slightly upturned to suggest a small smile. The cheekbones of the figure are subtly modelled, while the face appears fleshy and rounded at the jawline and neck. On the reverse, the limestone has been smoothed to a flat plane. The left side of the figure\u2019s nose is slightly damaged, and the majority of the left ear is also now lost with chips also visible across the king\u2019s face. There are also several chips to the outer edges of the nemes and the sides of the bust.

Such models were used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure the production of an even three-dimensional sculpture; on the reverse of typical surviving trial-pieces, this area usually included an incised proportional grid. Most surviving busts end at the tips of the nemes lappets, though here the bust is slightly longer and ends at the king\u2019s chest. For the significance of the \u2018pendant snake\u2019 as opposed to the usually raised uraeus depicted on the nemes, see Hill (2007). Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain. The provenance for this particular bust is not known (PM VIII). Further Bibliography: M. Hill, 2007. \u2018Lives of the Statuary\u2019 in M. Hill, D.
