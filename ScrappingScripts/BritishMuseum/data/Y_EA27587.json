This specimen, however, is just a model and not an actual piece of temple equipment. Situlae in metal, decorated or not, are common votive objects of the Late and Ptolemaic Period. They were massively produced ex-votos that visiting pilgrims dedicated in temples and shrines (see the chapter on situlae in Green 1987, 66-115).
