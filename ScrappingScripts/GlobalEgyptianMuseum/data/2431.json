{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1910:375B-D", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Name": "Three faience amulets", "Description": "Three faience amulets: the largest is a silhouette figure of one of the four Sons of Horus, protective deities of the internal organs removed in mummification, with holes at top and bottom for attaching to a bead net placed over the outer wrappings; at top right is a fine udjat-eye, in black and blue faience; the smallest is a stylised figure of the dwarflike leonine god Bes, with feathered head-dress. The three were found in a rich shaft tomb with four chambers, in the south cemetery at Abydos, plundered in antiquity but yielding finds principally of the early New Kingdom. This may be the date of the udjat-eye and Bes amulet, but the bead nets with Sons of Horus do not appear on mummies before the Late Period, indicating reuse of the tomb then."}
