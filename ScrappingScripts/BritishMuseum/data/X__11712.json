Hand-made quadruped animals were made by adding sausages of clay, and pinching or impressing details to the clay. Relatively poorly represented at Naukratis (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston RES.87.219, RES.87.217, 86.423; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge GR.15.1899, GR.37.1887, E.237.1899; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896- 1908-E.4788, AN1886.507; Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge NA626, NA624), considering this is usually a common figure in Late Period Nile Delta sites. The animals primarily represent bulls or cows, though rams may also be represented and this is not always clear.
