{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 44744", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UPPER EGYPT", "Category": "COSMETIC AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND IMPLEMENTS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Name": "Cosmetic Container in the Form of a Calf", "Description": "A wonderful cosmetic container in the shape of a calf, shows the skill of the craftsmen of the New Kingdom at achieving these small objects with care and artistic feeling. The piece of wood from which the container is made was cut into two parts: a box that was hollowed to hold the contents and a lid. The crouching calf's figure is carved with the details of the head and the body in relief. The legs, however, are more stylized. The figure would suggest the fertility and rejuvenation, which the calf symbolized, and which would be bestowed upon the owner of the container."}
