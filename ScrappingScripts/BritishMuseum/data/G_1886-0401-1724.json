According to Petrie, such pendant had some amuletic properties and were worn as forehead pendants, in burial contexts; the examples are however dated to the Prehistoric and modern period (Petrie 1914, 29, pl. XVI no. 130). It is uncertain if Naukratis examples had similar function and context of discovery.
