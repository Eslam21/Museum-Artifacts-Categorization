Description in Biliotti's Kamiros diary: Other fragments of porcelain. No marking of excavation day visible on the object itself.

It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960\u2019s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised according to tomb group; (5) the Kamiros well list, which is based upon the Kamiros tomb list with additions by Reynold Higgins and Virginia Webb. All archives are kept in the Department of Greece and Rome.
