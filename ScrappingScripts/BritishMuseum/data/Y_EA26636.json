A large boat with curved hull is painted on each side of the pot. Each boat has two cabins with a Z-shaped standard appended to the right cabin. A large frond from the left prow arches over the boat and terminates in an irregular shape above the cabins on one side. The terminal motif on the other side is better drawn. Below each boat is a fan-shaped bush motif. The handles are painted with horizontal lines, above which are a series of horizontal \u2018broken\u2019 lines. Below one handle is a Naqada plant, roughly drawn. Below the other handle is a bush and a Naqada plant. The identity of the Naqada plant remains a matter of discussion. Published: A. Roveri and F.
