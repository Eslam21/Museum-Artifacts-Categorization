{"artifact_name": "commemorative scarab", "Object Type": ["commemorative scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA64661"], "Description": [" Steatite lion hunt scarab of Amenhotep III: this large, dark green blue, glazed steatite scarab, with standardised markings on the back to indicate the head, prothorax, wing cases and scorings on the legs imitating feathering, is one from a series which were produced during the reign of King Amenhotep III to commemorate various important royal events. The incised inscription on the underside of this example records that in the first ten years of his reign the king himself shot with bow and arrow 102 lions. It also provides the full royal titulary of five names borne by Amenhotep III and states that Queen Tiye was his chief wife. The scarab is pierced longitudinally.

These large commemorative scarabs with regnal dates are unique to the reign of Amenhotep III. Over 170 examples from the five different sets survive and have been found not only in Egypt but as far north as Syria and in the south, beyond the Second Cataract in the Sudan. It has been suggested that they were sent out to the provinces like palace bulletins to keep officials there informed of the personal affairs of their sovereign. One authority has even likened them to modern newspapers. Whatever the specific function of these particular scarabs, any object in the shape of the dung beetle retained the underlying amuletic significance of affording new life or resurrection.
