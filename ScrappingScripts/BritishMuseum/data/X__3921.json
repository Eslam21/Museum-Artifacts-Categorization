Lemos places this phiale in the Mature Animal Style, but the decoration is not typical of the style. The only filling ornament is the elaborate rosette set in front of the lion; such a rosette as the only filling ornament is commonly found in the later Chalice Style. The rim pattern and lion is also consistent with the Chalice Style. For parallels regarding the rosette, see Lemos no. 928 from Tocra and Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA67 and Oxford AN1896-1908-G.114.15. For parallels regarding the lion, see Lemos nos. 971 from Pitane and 972 from Kamiros. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 63, no. 739, pl.
