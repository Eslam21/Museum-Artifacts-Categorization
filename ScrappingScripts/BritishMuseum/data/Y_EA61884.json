It symbolized the individual's ability to move freely, and was supposed to leave the tomb and fly to join the sun god in the sky. On account of this role, the 'Ba' was regularly depicted in the form of a bird with a human head (and often also with human arms). However, in order to ensure eternal life, the 'Ba' had to return to the burial chamber periodically to be reunited with the mummy. Small wooden figures of the 'Ba' such as this were sometimes placed on coffins or mounted on the top of wooden funerary stelae.
