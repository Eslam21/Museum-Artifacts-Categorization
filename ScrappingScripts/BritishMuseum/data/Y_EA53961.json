This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 5C; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 5). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, type 5C; Thomas and Tomber 2006: type 5). This type of stopper was usually used for non-wine products such as oil and fish sauces in early Roman Egypt, although probably not in this case due to the presence of a fermentation hole, which indicates that the wine or beer had not finished fermenting when first transported (Thomas 2011, type 5; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 5). The Greek letters, \u03b2 and \u03c0 separated by a chi-rho monogram, may be the initials of a personal name. Cf., similar stamp was found at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.2). Egloff, M. 1977.
