Between the nozzle volutes is an air-hole. The discus is decorated with two lovers, both entertainers, on a bed: the man reclines on his right elbow on a pillow, and holds his left arm up to the woman who sits away from him, straddling his body. She holds castanets in each hand and wears a breast-band. Sheets are piled on the foot of the bed. The lamp stands on a slightly raised base. Covered with a finger-marked brown slip.
