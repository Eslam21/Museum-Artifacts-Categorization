It is probably an imaginary workshop, considering the diverse activites represented: from the right to the left one sees the bakery, the brewery and slaughtering. The first statuette on the right, which is seated in front of a bread oven, is a female judging by the yellow-ochre colour of her skin and her clothes which leave a shoulder bare. The other persons are all male."}
