This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Parallels from Naukratis in the British Museum (GR 1886,0401.1739) Bristol (2008.4, 2008.7), and from Olympia (Baitinger 2001, 150-4). Zweeiflugelige Tullenfeilspitzen IIA3 (late) 7th century BC \u2013 (mid) 6th century BC. The form has developed out of New Kingdom types, typical of Egyptian style arrow-heads. Other examples are known from Tell Dafana BM EA 1887.0101.1442, 1887.0101.1444-7, 1935.0823.117, 1935.0823.115, and 1935.0823.106. Parallels also come from the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.2, 45 dated to late 7th - 6th centuries BC). Another British Museum parallel from Egypt BM EA 1898,0312.29 belongs to the Zweifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIA3 (Baitinger 2001, fig. 150) typical of the Anatolian, Turkish and Ionian region, adopted around the Greek world between the second half of the 7th century BC and the 5th century BC (Snodgrass 1964, 151 double edged Form 3A1 dated to before c.600 to 460 BC). Parallels from Marathon in the British Museum include BM GR 1864,0220.69. Erdmann supplies a very broad range of dates (Erdmann 1973, 45 Form DIIa, dated to 8th-4th BC or possibly an even longer range).
