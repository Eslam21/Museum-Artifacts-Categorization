Maniamun, the scribe of the count of corn, wears a short artificial beard and a pleated wig reaching his shoulders and leaving his ears exposed; his own hair is seen on the temples. The face is finely carved, the nose is straight, the lips are rather full; the eyebrows and eyelids are not carved but only painted. The face and hands are painted reddish-brown, the wig, beard, eyebrows, eyelids, pupils are black. The front surface of the statue is covered by sis lines of hieroglyphic inscription containing the offering formula, the name and title of Maniamun and filiation. The face of Maniamun reminds that of Amenhotep II, which in the light of the New Kingdom tradition to reproduce the features of the ruling kings in private sculpture is a reliable dating criterion."}
