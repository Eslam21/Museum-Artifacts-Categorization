{"artifact_name": "textile; garment; tunic; mummy-wrapping(re-use)", "Object Type": [" textile ", " garment ", " tunic ", " mummy-wrapping (re-use) "], "Museum number": ["EA6532"], "Description": [" Textile fragment; lower half of one side of undyed linen tunic; vertical side-seam joining two selvedges; twisted warp fringe preceded by triple self-band; stained with resin or bitumen from re-use on mummy. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spun and S-spliced; the stitch gauge is warp c.29 ends per 10mm and weft 10 picks per 10mm. The two plain selvedges are probably the same one folded back on itself - i.e. the two fringes are two ends of the same cloth. They include warp fringes without knots, each two threads Z-plied then S-twisted with neighbouring pair. The seam is oversewn/top sewn with S-spun, z-plied linen thread; darning thread ditto - all the darning lines of hitches are parallel to the warp holding and grouping the weft.
