The body is encased in a painted cartonnage mummy-case. Skull - Mouth closed. Some teeth missing. There is considerable dental attrition. Artificial eyes inserted in orbits. Bound on to the top of the head is an opaque object resembling a skull-cap. This may possibly be a package containing the placenta.6 The cervical spine appears intact. There are no obvious fractures.

In the right upper zone of the thorax there are two scarabs and a small pencil-like object, very probably a bird-bone, lying just below the mid-shaft of the clavicle. There is a pectoral with open wings and a rectangular plate over the flank-incision. There are possible pathological changes in the anterior third of the 2nd left rib. There is a large rounded mass in the pelvic region. The dorsal and lumbar intervertebral discs are partially opaque. Arms - Extended. Hands with extended fingers over the pubic area. On the ring-finger of each hand is a ring with a rectangular bezel. Legs - No fractures. Numerous well-defined lines of arrested growth are visible at the lower ends of the tibiae.
