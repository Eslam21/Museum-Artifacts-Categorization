He was buried together with his parents and two of his brothers in a two-chambered family tomb at Abydos. Inside the vaulted sepulcher, sand had been heaped over the sarcophagi of the three occupants. Canopic chests had been placed on the top of this fill, and most of the shabtis of Petosiris were discovered lying loose within the sand. In total, three hundred and eighty-five shabtis of different sizes belonging to Petosiris were found; thirty-six of these were inscribed with spell 6 of the 'Book of the Dead'. It is conceivable that these represent the thirty-six \"overseers\" traditionally required for a full set, and that the plain shabtis were the \"workers.\" The adjacent chamber contained the burial of Petosiris' father Djedher. Interestingly, the shabtis of the father, though crudely modeled, were of the more traditional type with a uniform blue-green glaze; this may indicate that Petosiris' two-tone shabtis were among the first of their type.
