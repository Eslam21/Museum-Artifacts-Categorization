{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 61665", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "STICK", "Material": "GOLD", "Technique": "HAMMERING", "Height": "131.5 cm", "Name": "Walking Stick of Tutankhamun", "Description": "This gold staff was found between the two outermost shrines in the burial chamber of the tomb of King Tutankhamun. The staff is tubular and is hollow throughout; the top is decorated with a figure of the king as a young man. He wears the Khepresh Blue Crown, which is related to certain ceremonies, and is dressed in a kilt. He stands with his arms slightly raised, his hands turned backwards in an unusual gesture.The role of this staff is not clear and nothing obvious can be suggested, particularly because of the figure of the king himself. Other staves found in the tomb were simply instruments of authority, to be carried on official occasions."}
