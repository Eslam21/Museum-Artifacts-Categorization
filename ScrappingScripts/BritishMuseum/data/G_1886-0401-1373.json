{"artifact_name": "stopper; seal-impression", "Object Type": [" stopper ", " seal-impression "], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1373"], "Description": [" Terracotta jar-stopper made of micaceous red-brown Nile silt. Front face has been stamped or pressed into a circular one-piece mould creating a cobra in relief, crowned with horned sun disc. Behind the snake are the letters PM (usually read clockwise on such seals). In front of the snake is a rough raised area of obscured letters, or perhaps the tip of its tail. At the rear are a series of grooves, arranged in a grid pattern, probably to key it to a mud or plaster sealing and plug as part of the stopper. Traces of plaster on edge and base.

This is probably a late variant of type 3A stoppers (Thomas 2011). In the eastern desert and Red Sea regions 50 examples of a similar cobra stamp have been found dating between the mid 1st to 2nd century AD at Myos Hormos (Thomas 2011: table 3.2, figs 3.11-13) and the 2nd century AD at Mons Claudianus (Tomber & Thomas 200: 252, fig. 2.15). Cobra seals have also been found at Coptos (Cuvigny : 5 figs 4-5). The best parallel is from Berenike (Bos & Helms 2000: 293), see also BM GR 1886,0401.1374 also from Naukratis. \u201cThirty six cobra stamps have been identified at Myos Hormos by the Chicago and Southampton teams. They account for 42% of all commercial wine stamps found at that port. Seven Cobra stamps have also been found at Mons Claudianus (V114 V412, V152, V172, V242, V379, V637 Thomas and Tomber 2006, 252-4) and a further seven are known to the author from Berenike (BE95-3184-Y038 Sundelin 1996; BE96-3664-Y019 Dieleman 1998; BE97-1967-Y008 Cashman, et al. 1999; BE98-4123-Y097 Bos and Helms 2000; BE99-1150-Y037, BE99-1149-Y024 Bos 2007; BE00-1179-Y043 Moulder 2007). Three features are visible; the striking cobra, a disc framed by horns above the cobra\u2019s head, and vegetation growing from beneath the cobra\u2019s body. These diagnostic features help identify the cobra as the I\u2019rt or Uraeus, the protective cobra goddess represented on the crown of the Pharaoh and later the Emperor (Hart 1986, 220). In the Middle Kingdom this cobra goddess was identified with Wadjt of the Nile Delta, who protected the Pharaoh from his enemies by spitting fire (Ibid.), and as a symbol of the Pharaoh-Emperor, it may represent a link to the Emperor. In later periods the I\u2019rt was associated with Renetutet \u2018the nurturer\u2019 a fertility goddess of the Fayum who was commonly depicted with papyrus stalks sprouting around her symbolising her fertility, and was depicted with the sun disc of R\u2019 and the horns of Hathor in the Roman period following a process of amalgamation (Renetutet-Isis-Hathor) of Egyptian deities during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (Roberts 1995), that became known in Greek as Hermouthis (Hart 1986, 185). Depictions of Renetutet have been recognised on wine jar stoppers dating to the 14th century BC and interpreted as representing wine from the Fayum (Hope 1978). Such stamps may represent produce from the Fayum\u2019 (Thomas 2011: 13). A Roman wooden stamp used to make such impressions was published from Theadelphie, Fayum (Nachtergael : 280, Figs 7-8) and Narmouthis, Fayum (Bresciani 1968: 30, fig.3, pls A:1 and X:1-3).The Fayum example was erroneously dated to 4th to 3rd century BC based on misidentification as Aramaic, but is instead probably 1st to 2nd AD like the others. For further parallels of plaster and fired-clay stoppers with a cobra, usually crowned, and often with letters or names see Bailey 32008 (no.3611). Parallels from Myos Hormos (Johnson 1979, 235, pl. 75:d\u2013f, from dated first century AD; Thomas 2001, 54, fig. 13.2, dated late first to second century AD; Thomas 2002: 66, fig. 44, no. ST 0259, from Myos Hormos, first or second century AD; Thomas 2003: 69, fig. 57, five examples, from contexts of mid-first to mid-second century AD) and Berenike (Sundelin 1996: 300\u20132, fig. 16-1, pl. 16-2, dated late first century AD; Cashman et al. 1999: 287, fig. 15:2, context of late first century BC to first century AD). A wooden stamp for a stopper with a cobra (reversed to ours) and a suggested Aramaic inscription (but probably Greek) comes from Narmuthis (Bresciani 1968: 30, fig. 3, pls A:1 and X:1\u20133, dated fourth to third century BC, but probably 1st century AD).
