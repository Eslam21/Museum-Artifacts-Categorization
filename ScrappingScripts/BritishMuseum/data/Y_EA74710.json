{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74710"], "Description": [" Portrait of a woman in encaustic on limewood: the panel is fissured at the left side and an unfortunate early attempt at conservation has damaged the proper right eye and brow. The surface is lightly coated with paraffin wax. The background is greenish grey. The subject, of refined appearance, wears a plain white tunic beneath a magenta mantle, the folds indicated in darker paint. The mantle appears to swathe the subject in a manner strongly reminiscent of sculptured stone and terracotta busts of the day, especially those from the North African provinces. The jewellery comprises two gold circular hoop earrings with pendant pearls and two necklaces, the upper of emerald beads linked with gold, and the lower a twisted gold chain. The hair is waved back from the face with a few snail curls around the central parting. The bun towards the rear is sketchily painted in lighter grey. A few strands escape around the outer edge of the coiffure. The dark brown eyes have flat lower lids; the strongly arched eyebrows meet above the long nose. The closed lips are orangey pink. Cream highlights are used in the centre of the face, which elsewhere is rendered with a warm cream and pink tone. The shape of the face and high cheekbones recall Cyrenaican portraits.
