This fragment and B394b differ in their execution but may well belong to different columns within the same group of columns. According to mathematical considerations the estimated upper diameter should span approximately 40 to 45 cm, which is close to the size of B393 (Dm 44 cm). The dimension between the axes was calculates 2 x 5,2 to 5,9 cm, resulting 10,4 to 11,8 cm and 12 ornament axis (Koenigs 2007, 315f. Cat. 4). Published (Petrie 1886, 5f.
