The upper side is flat with about half of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal visible. Recognisable are two of three lines in hieroglyphs, the first one is only preserved on EA86918 showing a very small cartouche with at least 4 signs, but a crack is running through it. The second line is written from the right to the left: 'Imn-[R'], nfr, underneath the third row is written from the left to the right: Hr (D2) wDA.t (D10). The same motif is found on EA86918 and EA86919.
