It consists of a hawk head of lapis lazuli secured within gold, ribbed mounts. The bird's head is finely modelled, with particular attention paid to the detailing of the feathers. There are remains of gilding on one of the hawk's head. The hoop is secured within an attachment soldered to this gold mount, and beneath this is a ring decorated with large granules. On the gold ring itself the end closest to the bird has a sleeve of sheet gold attached to prevent a series of beads, consisting of lapis lazuli, red jasper and a gold ring with granulation, from slipping around the hoop.
