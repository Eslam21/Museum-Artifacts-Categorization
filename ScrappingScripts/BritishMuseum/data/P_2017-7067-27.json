His interest developed during his time at the French Academy in Rome, as the winner of the 1741 Prix de Rome, during which time he visited the excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum. At the same time, he became aware of the etchings of Piranesi, whose influence is also visible here. After his return to Paris, Challe continued to follow the career of the Roman architect, antiquarian and draughtsman, translating his works for a projected but never published French edition."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Sven Gahlin"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Adolphe Stein"], "Acquisition date": ["2017"], "Acquisition notes": ["Acquired by Sven Gahlin in 1995 from an anonymous sale at Christie's, London, 3 April 1995, lot 105.
