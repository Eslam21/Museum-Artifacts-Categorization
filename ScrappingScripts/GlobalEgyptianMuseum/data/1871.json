{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1900:43", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Name": "Shabti of Abedmut", "Description": "Green glazed faience shabti with a single vertical line of hieroglyphs down the front, naming the deceased as Abedmut. The first part of the name appears foreign, and this may be a Western Asiatic living in Egypt. The figure holds pick and hoe, with basket over the left shoulder, and wears a plain wig with long lappets, and a long beard of the kind worn by gods. The back pillar bears no inscription. The shabti was a special figure placed in the tomb to carry out any heavy labour required of the tomb-owner in the afterlife. This example is typical of Late Period burials, which included hundreds of shabtis, with one for each day of the 365-day Egyptian year."}
