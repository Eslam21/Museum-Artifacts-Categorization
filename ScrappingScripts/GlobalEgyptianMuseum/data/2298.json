{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:271", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "0.5 cm", "Width": "0.6 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs. This example is crudely moulded, with an indistinct motif on the underside, perhaps derived from the hieroglyph for 'gold'. As the metal that never tarnishes, gold symbolises eternity and occurs in Egyptian texts as the flesh of the gods; it is also a name for the goddess Hathor, originally perhaps as the sun-filled sky."}
