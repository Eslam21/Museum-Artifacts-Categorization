Preserved is part of a head of a king wearing the nemes head dress. The face is not preserved, the neck is visible without a beard. the right edge of the nemes as well as the back of the head where the nemes is bundled is visible. The surface is slightly smoothed but not polished, no colour preserved. White accretion on parts of the surface as well as remains of the soil, not properly cleaned yet. The clay statuette was fired and shows a wide black core and a very thin red oxidation zone, suggesting that the firing was relatively short. The part of the shoulder where the statue is broken, is hollowed out from the underside showing some rough furnishing and traces of finger smearing while the clay was still wet. The clay itself is fine and no voids of organic inclusions are visible.
