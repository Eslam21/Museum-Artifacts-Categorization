Furthermore, the heavy chalice does not typically appear as early as in the Wild Goat Style, but the thickness and diameter of this sherd suggest that it comes from a vessel much larger than a chalice. Perhaps this sherd marks the transition to the Mature Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1524) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.486"]}
