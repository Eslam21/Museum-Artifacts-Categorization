", " No provenance is listed in the Rochdale Museum register, but this is the only terracotta head in the Rochdale collection that could be the 'terra cotta head (fragt of) from the temple of Aphrodite, Circa 500 BC' mentioned in the Egypt Exploration Fund distribution list as having been given to the Heywood Free library, Manchester. This seems to be later in date than that given by the Egypt Exploration Fund (which is not unusual for many of the terracotta dates). The thin neck and features suggest this may be a badly worn 3rd to 2nd century BC Ptolemaic example that were commonly found and made at Naukratis (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA529, NA528, NA527). Alternatively there are 4th century Classical Greek types from Halicarnassus (Higgins 1954, no. 497), Ephesus (ibid. no. 558), and Attica (ibid. see no. 729) that are similar.
