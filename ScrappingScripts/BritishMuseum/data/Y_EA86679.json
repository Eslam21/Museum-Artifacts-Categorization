The clay was hardened after excavation. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica particles. The front shows two impressions of a scarab-like seal close to each other, the upper one is preserved in its lower part, the lower one preserved in its upper part. The seal impressions show again a bird on the right, facing left, behind it an uraeus. In front of the bird (probably a falcon) two signs over the full height, the first one like a loop (maybe an ankh?), the second one like a standard? Same motif as EA86676.
