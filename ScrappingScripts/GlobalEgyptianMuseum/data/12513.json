It shows a pharaoh facing right, probably striding. The king wears the nemes-head dress (the uraeus is broken off), a wesekh-collar, armlets, bracelets, and a vest with narrow shoulder straps. In his left hand he holds a staff, probably a uas-sceptre. The right hand may have been holding an ankh-sign. The jewels and the fringes of his clothing are very detailed.
