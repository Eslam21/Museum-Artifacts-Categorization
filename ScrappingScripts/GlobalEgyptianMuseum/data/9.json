The looms became more complicated and the fabrics more complex. The wool \"taquet\u00c3\u00a9s\" with a checkerboard motif are the oldest examples of this advance in technology.

This example consists of a plain purple band and a piece of beige and brown wool made up of registers of flower motifs in a geometric network of meanders (compare ACO.Tx. 0060)."}
