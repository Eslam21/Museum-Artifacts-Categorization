", " Parallels made and found in Naukratis, now in the British Museum (GR1886,0401.1473, 1474 and 1475), were found together at the Terracottas workshop in Site 95. Parallels include a complete, but plain example, dated 'Roman' (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995: no. 307) and another plain undamaged example is in Cairo Museum (no. 69852). An ornate version is currently in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, (Egyptian Department no. 10.130.1026), with the mouth modelled in the form of a bust of a wreathed veiled woman emerging from an acanthus; her left arm acts as the crosspiece, with her hand gripping a phallus. Another decorative, but very fragmentary example comes from Alexandria (nos Fou 10560-4 shown to Bailey by Marie-Dominique Nenna; Bailey 2008: 89).
