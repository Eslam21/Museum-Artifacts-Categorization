Among relatively close parallels see particularly a scarab decorated with the protome of a ram above a neb-basket sign (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 326, no. 685) and a second one with a similar type of protome associated with a Djed-pillar (Magnarini 2004, 217, 9.11). The latter was tentatively dated to the 25th-26th Dynasty by Magnarini (Magnarini 2004, 217). By its size, style and technique, this finely made miniature scarab probably belongs to Gorton's type VIII, a type well attested on Punic and Etruscan sites in the West, as well as in Greece and Cyprus (Gorton 1996, type VIII, 23-7). Gorton suggested that such scarabs were produced in Memphis, from the 8th till the 7th c. BC (Gorton 1996, 27).
