His hands protrude from the wrappings and hold the \"Was\" scepter, which symbolizes prosperity and well being. The \"Was\" scepter is a straight shaft with the handle in the form of a dog-like animal and the base ends in two prongs. The eyes of the statue are inlaid. The god's head is shaven and covered by a tight-fitting skullcap leaving his ears exposed. He has a straight beard and leans against a large Djed pillar topped by a small pyramid. The Djed pillar represents stability and is also associated with Ptah. The small pyramid has the name of the city of Men-Nefer engraved on it. Ptah was the patron deity of Men-Nefer, another name for Memphis. The features of the statue are not well defined due to the hardness of the basalt and the hieroglyphic texts are roughly engraved."}
