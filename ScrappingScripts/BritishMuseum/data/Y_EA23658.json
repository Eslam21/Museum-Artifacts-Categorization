{"artifact_name": "cooking-pot", "Object Type": ["cooking-pot"], "Museum number": ["EA23658"], "Description": [" Wheelmade cooking-pot of coarse red silt pottery, with remains of a bright red slip on the exterior. The micaceous fabric contains inclusions of grit. The surface has been affected by salts and much has flaked off. Rounded base, convex sides and an open mouth with a plain rim. A small loop handle is attached at either side. Around he better-preserved handle are four applied blobs of clay, two set in line with the top of the handle and the other two at the base, looking like imitations of rivets on a metal vessel. The bad condition of the other side makes it impossible to say whether this feature was matched at that location. Repaired from three fragments with part of the rim and side missing.
