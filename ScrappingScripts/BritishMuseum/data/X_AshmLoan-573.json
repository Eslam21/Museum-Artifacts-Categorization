", " The sherd joins British Museum 1924,1201.840. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior (Williams 1983, 169). Many kantharoi Type B have painted inscriptions beneath the rim and several have been found on Aegina as well as at Naukratis. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the fabric was found to have originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286). It must also be pointed out that despite Jones' identification of the sherd as being in the Chalice Style, the sherd firmly belongs to a Type B kantharos. Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5.
