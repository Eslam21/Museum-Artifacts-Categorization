", " A relatively large corpus of sphendonoids weights have been found in various sites of Egypt and Naukratis provided quite a few of these (Petrie1886, pl. XXIII, \u201cbarrel\u201d type; Court-Marty 1990, 26, fig. 7, fig. 26). Most of them are made out of bronze, but haematite is very well attested and other stones occur also, like for this specimen. This type, particularly well-represented in the Near-East, appeared in the New Kingdom and persisted till the Late Period. The sphendonoid assemblage at Naukratis represents the smaller denominations and seems to have been used to weight with utmost precision quantities of commodities smaller than those weighed with most of the Egyptian style domed weights. Such observation has already been done on the sphendonoids weights in general (Court-Marty 1990, 26), and in particular for those found on the Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Uluburun (Pulak 2000, 260). Naukratis ones however are of even smaller value and several sphendonoid weights, which comes either from Naukratis or Tell Defenneh, are even less than half a gram (Court-Marty 1990, 26). Sphendonoids weights are usually associated to the deben-kedet and Near Eastern shekel standards (Court-Marty 1990, 26). Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.

Petrie was not sure about the standard of this weight (Petrie 1886, 79 and 83, no. 516). Weights of sphendonoid shape are usually typical of the Late Bronze Age. They persist in the Aegan iron age, so maybe latest early 7th century BC. For parallel of this type of weight: Kroll 2008, Oxford Journal of Archaeology 27.1, 37-48.
