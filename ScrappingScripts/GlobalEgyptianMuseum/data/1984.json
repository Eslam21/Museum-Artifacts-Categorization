{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:771.7", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-FAIYUM", "Category": "COIN", "Material": "COPPER", "Technique": "STAMP IMPRESSION", "Diameter": "2.3 cm", "Name": "Coin minted in Alexandria", "Description": "Copper coin, with surfaces worn from extensive ancient use. Coins were a feature of the Mediterranean economy, and not the ancient Egyptian. They became common in Egyptian commerce only in the Ptolemaic Period (after 305 BC). They are accordingly inscribed in Greek or Latin, never in hieroglyphs or Egyptian shorthand, and the images conform to the rules of classical Greek, rather than Pharaonic art."}
