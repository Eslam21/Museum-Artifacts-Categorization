{"artifact_name": "crotal", "Object Type": ["crotal"], "Museum number": ["EA54014"], "Description": [" Pair of crotals, consisting of two small cymbals fixed to a handle in the shape of tongs: the wooden handle terminates in a grip covered with leather, which is held in place by means of thongs. The arms of the handle are of equal thickness where the cymbals are attached, and each one ends in a point. Towards the grip one arm becomes thinner, and has been broken across and split down the centre; the other becomes considerably thicker. Both arms are crudely worked. The rims of the cymbals are slightly turned up at the edge, so that the points of contact are towards the central, saucer-shaped depression. The rims have a pronounced flange on the back of the cymbals. There is a decoration of two pairs of concentric circles on both cymbals.
