Together with Harpocrates, they form the famous egyptian triad from the Roman Period. The god wears a \"calathos\" head-dress, symbol of fertility, and is dressed in a tunic and coat which covers the shoulders. The goddess has long hair and a wavy band surmounted by a Hathoric crown that is composed of a solar disk between a pair of horns. The piece probably comes from an Alexandrian workshop where many dishes of this type have been found."}
