Almost the entire front of the case has been stained black by bitumen which obscures most of the detail of the underlying painting and vignettes, still barely visible at the sides. The gilded face mask is damaged.Along the right-hand side of the case is a single line of inscription, badly preserved, the beginning having disappeared completely.The underside is brightly painted, vivid yellow, red and black. One deity holds a lizard.The mummy remains inside, accessible through a long slit in the underside of the case. "}
