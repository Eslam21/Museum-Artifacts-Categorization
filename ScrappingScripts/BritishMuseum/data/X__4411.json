", " Bronze figures of Harpokrates were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods in Egypt (Weiss 2012, 126-157, Typ 41-69, Pl. 11-19), chiefly in the Delta where his cult was particularly developed (Sandri 2006). Likewise, the child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). This figure of Harpokrates belongs to the type 59 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a relatively rare type found also in Bubastis, Athribis and Saqqara (Weiss 2012, 147, 606-607, Pl. 17c-e). The very flat and crude design featured on this figure is found on other Naukratite bronzes, such as: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.247, 86.251, 86.253, 86.261 and 86.284; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.616; BM 1885,1101.568 and BM 1885,1101.91.
