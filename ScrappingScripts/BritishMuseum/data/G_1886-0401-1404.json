{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1404"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Aphrodite. Head inclined to the left wearing a Stephane (diadem), detached from the large figure of the goddess Aphrodite. Very well modelled, the hair parted in the centre and richly waved, drawn back to a bun, with some of the long tresses brought to the top of the head and knotted there. In front of these tresses is a plain diadem. The neck is angled, and radiating grooves were cut across its lower edges to key it to the separately made body to which it was attached. The head is hollow, and mould-made, with added and manipulated hair. Traces of an overall white dressing covered by red paint on the back of the neck and black on the hair. Orange-brown Nile silt with a grey core, frequent, fine gold mica and common white and black inclusions.
