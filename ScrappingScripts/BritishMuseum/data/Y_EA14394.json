{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA14394"], "Description": [" Fragmentary steatite head of a male figure. He wears a smooth rounded wig which is set high on the forehead and obscures the ears. His eyes are narrow with a heavy ridge indicating the upper eyelids. A faint sloping ridge conveys the eyebrows. His nose is broad at the nostrils, and his upper lip is thick and fleshy. The lower lip is thin and sharply incised. The outer corners of the mouth are flat, and his face appears rounded and fleshy around the mouth and chin. The right side of the face below the eye and at the chin below the lower lip are both chipped. There are further chips around the edge of the wig at the forehead, and several small scratches across the wig at the front and both sides. The figure is now attached to a modern rectangular base.

The fragmentary state makes it difficult to determine the original pose of the figure, and it's also uncertain whether the figure may have once contained an inscription either carved upon the back-pillar (for which there is no discernible trace here) or on a statue base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["incomplete - head only"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Rev Greville John Chester"], "Acquisition date": ["1879"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA14394"], "Registration number": ["1879,1120.138"]}
