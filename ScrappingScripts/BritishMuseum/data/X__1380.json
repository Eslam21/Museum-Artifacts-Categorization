", " Fabric is likely from a Cypriot imported figure as the form suggests, though this is not certain as the organic vessicles resemble that of local Delta Egyptian fabrics. A variety of horse-and-rider terracotta figures were produced on Cyprus during the Cypro-Archaic period and into later periods, from Amathus, and Salamis (Murray, Smith & Walters 1900, 112; Karageorghis 1995, 76; Fourrier 2007, 25). Horse-and-rider subject in Cyprus coincides with its appearance in the Near East and the Aegean in the Cypro-Geometric I-III period and clearly remained important until the Hellenistic period. The figurine workshop at Kourion almost exclusively made horse-and-rider figurines between the 7th and 1st centuries BC (Winter 1991, 221). A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.
