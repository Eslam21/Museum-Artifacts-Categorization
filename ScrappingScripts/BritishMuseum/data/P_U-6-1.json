They were followed by an album devoted to Gaspar Dughet and another to Claude Lorrain (U,9 and 10). All these albums were placed in the midst of the series devoted to Italian masters, for the reason that all these painters worked in Italy. Other French artists are in R,8 and in the volumes X,1 to 9. U,6 contained 39 prints. It began with portraits of Poussin, followed by scenes from the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament up to the Flight into Egypt, and groups of the Holy Family. U,7 continued the prints of religious subjects, containing the Holy Family with saints, the ministry of Christ, the Passion and the lives of Saints. The last album, U.8, contained scenes from classical history and mythology and landscapes. Most of the prints came from the Cracherode bequest, but significant numbers came from Sloane. The albums U,6 to 8 were taken apart by Reid in July 1875."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["U,6.1"]}
