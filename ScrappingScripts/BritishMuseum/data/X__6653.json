", " Isis nursing is a theme relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets made of bronze or glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). Isis lactans appears to be an important amuletic figure for the mummy but also used in the daily life for the protection of women and children (Andrews 1994, 48). Such figures were also deposited as ex-votos. They became truly popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314; Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, pl. 56, G12). On Isis amulets see: Andrews 1994, 48-49, fig. 18; Herrmann et al. 2010, 30-32 (types 4-5). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the McLean Museum & Art Gallery tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs and scaraboids moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
