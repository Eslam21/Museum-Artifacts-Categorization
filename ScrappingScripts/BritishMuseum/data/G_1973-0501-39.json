A seated man with his left leg bent with the knee raised, and his right leg bent with the knee on the ground, the foot crossing in front of the root of his gigantic and slightly curved phallus, which he holds against his left shoulder with his left hand. His right hand holds a large indeterminate animal, perhaps a monkey or a bird, to the front of his body, its head resting against his chest and its left foreleg resting on the man\u2019s shoulder. All is coarsely modelled, in particular the head and face: he may be shaven with a side-lock. There is no plinth, and the lower edge slants up to the figure\u2019s left: the object was not made to stand. The back is flat. Solid; one-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with many white inclusions. The front has substantial traces of a white dressing, much of which is painted black.
