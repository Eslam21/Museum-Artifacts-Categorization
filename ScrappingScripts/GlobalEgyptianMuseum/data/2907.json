{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:257", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "EASTERN DESERT AND SINAI", "Category": "GAME PIECE", "Material": "CARNELIAN ?", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "1.3 cm", "Name": "Gaming piece", "Description": "Orange-red rock, perhaps carnelian, shaped to a cone of hexagonal section, presumably for use as a gaming-piece. In the absence of archaeological context, its interest lies in the date of acquisition, as part of the collection of antiquities formed by Lady Harriet Kavanagh. Her collection with its inventory provides a rare example of a well-documented private group of materials from the 1840s. In this context the date of this piece is uncertain, but it may be of the Greco-Roman Period."}
