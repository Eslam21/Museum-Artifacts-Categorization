{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["2006,L01.1"], "Description": [" Pottery amphora, fragmentary, with painted decoration. On one side confronted boxers flank a prize dinos on a stand; a bird, probably a raptor, standing on an ionic column, survives behind one of the boxers. On the other side the heads of two standing women remain, behind whom are plants, a tree or a bush. Only one handle is present and the lower body is almost completely gone, together with the base. Around the neck of the vase is a band of four cartouches with the Throne Name and the Birth Name of the Egyptian king Apries of the Saite dynasty. Another large fragment, decorated with crescents and a scale pattern, belongs to the lower part of the same vessel but does no join.
