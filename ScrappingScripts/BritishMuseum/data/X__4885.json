{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Isis. A large figure of \u2018Isis-Aphrodite anasyr(o)mene\u2019, perhaps Isis-Bubastis, holding up the front of her tunic to show her pubic area; the back of the garment falls in curved folds of drapery beside her legs. She stands on a small, round fronted, inadequate plinth. Her hair is parted in the middle and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears large earrings and an enormous wreath with decorative elements, including discs with raised points, bound across the front with a narrow horizontal garland tied at each side; leaves fall beside her upper arms. Below the leaves hang wide ribbons from the headdress. From the top of the wreath rises a large flaring kalathos (now lost). The back is largely plain, with a small circular vent. Traces of white coating. Hollow, made in a two-piece mould, with a vent in the back. Red-brown Nile Delta silt fabric with a red-brown surface and abundant gold mica, quartz and some white inclusions. Top of headdress missing.

", " Parallel from early 2nd century BC context from Tell Atrib (Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 46). Her hands, while holding up the tunic (which has short sleeves), are in the same pose as the naked Hathor figures discussed by Bailey (2008, nos 2991\u20133000, see especially 2997, in the British Museum). Parallel dated first half of first century AD (head and shoulder fragment without a kalathos, Philipp 1972, figs 19 and 20).
