{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA147"], "Description": [" Round-topped limestone stela of Tjaiemhotep: the size of this piece alone indicates the importance of Tjaiemhotep own right. In the figured scene, beneath the usual winged sun disc, Tjaiemhotep herself stands at the right with hands raised in the attitude of prayer. Anatomically correctly, but by Egyptian artistic conventions most unusually, she is depicted with both breasts shown. The hieroglyphs before her provide her title, name and mother's name alone. The signs above the conventionally heaped offering table describe the ritual as 'adoring the god four times'. The row of deities adored from right to left comprise the local Memphite funerary god Sokaris, in the guise of Osiris; bull-headed Apis; Isis and Nephthys, Horus, Anubis, and the falcon of the West. The text with each figure provides the name and epithet and various wishes granted to the deceased. The frame at each side is a 'was'-sceptre.
