{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1910:368", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "INLAY", "Material": "GLASS; LIMESTONE ?; BASALT ?", "Technique": "CARVED; INLAID", "Height": "2 cm", "Width": "3.8 cm", "Depth": "1.7 cm", "Name": "Two eye inlays", "Description": "Two eye inlays from wooden coffins or cartonnage mummy masks, since perished. The eye whites are of limestone, and the pupils in one case of a hard black stone such as basalt, in the other tentatively identified as glass. The eyes, from two separate coffins according to their scale and shape, were found in a Middle Kingdom tomb at the north end of the Abydos cemeteries, dating to the 12th Dynasty, about 1800 BC, according to the spherical faience beads from the same tomb. At this date glass is very rarely attested in Egypt, but the archaeological context is uncertain and the eyes may come from later burials reusing the Middle Kingdom site."}
