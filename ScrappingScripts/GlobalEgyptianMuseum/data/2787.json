The cavity in the back of the statuette would have contained a rolled funerary papyrus. This means of preserving the papyrus is first attested, though rarely, in the 19th Dynasty and in the 20th Dynasty, but then becomes common in the 3rd Intermediate Period. In the Late Periods the custom is no longer found, though figures of the god as Ptah-Sokar-Osiris were made with hollow pedestals in which germinated seeds might be placed."}
