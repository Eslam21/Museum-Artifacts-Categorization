{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA69536"], "Description": [" Lower portion of a pair statue of black granite (or possibly granodiorite) depicting the king Sobekemsaf and the goddess Mut seated on a low-backed throne. Sobekemsaf wears a short shendyt kilt, and remains of his right arm show that this was placed along the side of the body. In his hand he appears to hold a piece of folded cloth. He sits slightly taller due to an added higher section of the seat on the right side. Under his feet is an incised depiction of the Nine Bows. The goddess Mut wears a long tight-fitting sheath dress, and her left upper arm is held along the side of the body with a clenched fist resting on her thigh. In her hand she holds an ankh symbol. On the reverse part of the king\u2019s kilt is still intact. A horizontal line of inscription enclosed in a long slim cartouche is placed along the top of the base in front of both figures, while the rest of the throne is uninscribed. At the top of both figures are square shaped deep holes, which would have been used to secure the top halves of the statue bodies to this lower half of the composition. In addition to the loss of their upper bodies, there are large cracks visible across the lower body and legs of the king. There are numerous small chips to the stone surface across the seat and both figures, with small gouges at the edge of the seat next to the figures\u2019 legs. The left side of the throne base is also damaged across the bottom, and there is a large chip is also notable at the right reverse corner of the throne base.

Based on the representation of Mut and this evocation, it is likely that this pair statue originates from Karnak, where Mut\u2019s cult was established (Fazzini 1999; Polz 2007). While the statue clearly represents either Sobekemsaf I or Sobekemsaf II from the Seventeenth Dynasty, based on the lack of further details within the inscription and the loss of the upper half of the statue which may have provided further stylistic features to distinguish between the two figures, it\u2019s not possible to establish with certainty which king is being depicted. However, other surviving representations of the latter Sobekemsaf also originating from Karnak have been argued to represent the same Sobekemsaf as the British Museum statue (Polz 2007). The image of the king\u2019s feet over the depiction of the Nine Bows, representations of the traditional enemies of Egypt, is an important visual depiction of the king\u2019s role as protector of Egypt and represents his dominion over the potential danger to the Egyptian land. That the king would be positioned to sit higher than the goddess is also notable; based on the fact that only one arm has survived for each figure that is held close to the body, it would seem that the other arms may have been used to embrace one another.
