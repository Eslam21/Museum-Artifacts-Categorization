Fish amulets were attached to the end of the plait of a child or young female as a charm against drowning. Presumably its magic worked by aversion, it was a reminder of the watery environment its wearer wished to avoid. However, the 'tilapia' also symbolized regeneration. The amulet's first mention is in a literary text known as the Westcar Papyrus, which dates to the Middle Kingdom, the time of the nekhau's greatest popularity. Contemporary representations depict it being worn as described. This form of fish amulet, with central green stone inlay, is exactly like the one which was lost by one of King Snuffer's harem girls as she rowed him on the lake, for in the Westcar text she refers to her \"nekhau of fresh turquoise.\" Feldspar was always considered an acceptable substitute for turquoise, which was only ever obtained from the copper mining region of Sinai.
