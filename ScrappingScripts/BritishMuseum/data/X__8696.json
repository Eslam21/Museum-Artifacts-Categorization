Lemos describes the other sherds from the vase as coming from a mediocre, but big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice kraters. Chalices in this group also display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1).
