It regroups on either side of a central neritic shell four disc-shaped beads of blue enamel, four barrel-shaped beads of carnelian and four disc-shaped beads of ostrich eggshell. The shell bears heavy wear marks. It is likely that a first hole broke and a second hole was pierced at the opposite end giving the shell an unusual shape."}
