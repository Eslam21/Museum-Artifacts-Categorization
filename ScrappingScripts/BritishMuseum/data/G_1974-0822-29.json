{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1974,0822.29"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Priapos. Priapos standing, his legs together and his belly thrust out. He looks down slightly to his right and his straggly beard falls on his chest. He wears a himation draped over his upper body, leaving his legs bare and his phallus rising over its lower edge. The mantle hides his left arm, which is akimbo, and covers his head. The top of the head, over which the himation was draped, is broken away; the shoulder of our figure may indicate that it had a raised right arm, probably but not certainly free of the himation. The back is plain, with part of the edge of a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with some white grits.
