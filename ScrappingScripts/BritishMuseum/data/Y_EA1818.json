{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1818"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Nyhebsedpepy: Nyhebsedpepy is represented in rough, low relief striding forward holding a staff and a sceptre in his hands. A single line of text at the top and another in front of the figure contain a conventional offering-text and the titles of the deceased who was a count and treasurer of the king of Lower Egypt. The signs are in sunk relief; the whole is in poor style, the figure, in particular, having little modelling; the edges of the relief are quite sharp and give the impression that the piece was never properly finished from a sculptural point of view. Most of the colour is preserved: red on the flesh of the figure, yellow on the kilt and staff, black on the wig, red and yellow for the collar, yellow for the bands of the armlets; considerable traces of red, yellow, and blue remain in the signs.
