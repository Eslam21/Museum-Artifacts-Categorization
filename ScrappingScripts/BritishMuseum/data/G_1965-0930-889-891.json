Also a similar lamp from Naukratis, now in Boston Museum of Fine Arts (88.1039), may also join. Don Bailey observed the clay of the lamp is similar to Fikellura pottery, which used to be believed to be produced on Rhodes, but is now known to have been produced virtually exclusively in Miletus and its colonies. Clay analysis conducted on several fragments of this and related lamps by M. Hughes (in Bailey 1988, British Museum Lamps III) suggests a Samian origin. Several sanctuary lamps were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Gardner 1888, 48; British Museum GR 1888,0601.151.a-c; 1888,0601.151.d-e; 1888,0601.151.f; 1888,0601.151.g), or were subsequently attributed to the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Bailey 1977, previously unregistered in the British Museum GR 1965,0930.884-885; GR 1965,0930.882; 1965,0930.883; 1965,0930.881; 1965,0930.880; 1965,0930.877; 1965,0930.878; 1965,0930.879; 1965,0930.888; 1965,0930.889-891; 1965,0930.892; 1965,0930.886; 1965,0930.887). A variety of Egyptian, Ephesian (Bailey 1977, Q 153, Q154) and Rhodian (ibid, 365, 370) sanctuary lamp types haev been found at Naukratis. Similar sanctuary lamps have been found at Athens (Howland 1958, Type 143), the sanctuary of Hemithea at Kastabos (Cook and Plommer 1966, 55-6, pl. 9) and the sanctuary of Demeter, Knossos (Coldstream 1973, pls 13, 15 and 26).
