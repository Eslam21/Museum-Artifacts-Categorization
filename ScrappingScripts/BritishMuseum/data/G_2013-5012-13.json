", " Two labels that were found in the box indicate finds from the Temple of Apollo in Naukratis, VIth cent. B.C. They concern a \"glazed-sand figure\" and a \"glazed-sand head\". This glazed composition figure finds parallels in Late Dynastic Egypt (Germond 2005, 71, no. 23 for a complete example). The deity represented is probably Nehebkau. In addition to the human arms, this snake deity could be represented with or without human legs (Herrmann 2003, 115, nos 568-9). He is the son of the goddess of harvests Renenutet according to some traditions and often confused with her. As a snake, Nehebkau could have protected against venomous bites. However, a link with prosperity and fertility can also be assumed. Germond, P. 2005, Le monde symbolique des amulettes \u00e9gyptiennes de la collection Jacques-\u00c9douard Berger, Milan.
