The painter and the group are named after the chalice found in the sanctuary of Aphaia at Aegina and vessels from this group display a thematic unity, all presenting figures in garments (mostly, as presrved, the lower parts of chitons and himatia). None of the vessels in this group have any filling ornament and the interior decoration of some of the vessels consists of komasts rendered in the light on dark technique. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
