Several bells of a rather similar type were discovered in Naukratis: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.751-88.752; Greenock, McLean Museum & Art Gallery 1987.443 (very corroded); BM 1888,0601.8; BM 1885,1101.101. It is difficult to say if small animal heads ornamented this bell (at the level of the protrusions), since the corrosion is so thick. On small bronze bells decorated with a Bes head and mythological animals: Anderson 1976, 32-34, no. 33-38; Hickmann 1949, pl. XXIII and XXVI. They are often dated to the Graeco-Roman or Roman period. However, at least three of them were discovered in the cemetery of Naukratis, which provided mainly material of the early Ptolemaic period. In this context, they likely had an amuletic function (Petrie 1914, 28). Anderson, R.D. 1976, Catalogue of Egyptian Antiquities in the British Museum III, Musical Instruments, London.
