Each woman wears a short black wig and a short white kilt. Beer and wine were important items in the offerings given to the deceased for the journey through the underworld. To make beer in ancient Egypt, grain dough was partly baked and soaked in water to obtain the mash. The next step was to mix the mash, using hands or feet, in large vats. The mash was then strained through a sieve placed on the mouth of another large vat and left to ferment."}
