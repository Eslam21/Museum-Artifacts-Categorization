{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA65443"], "Description": [" Naophorous basalt figure of the male official Sematawy holding a smaller figure of the deity Atum, the original feet and base of the statue now lost. The figure wears a version of the \u2018Persian wrap\u2019 garment with a large knot of material tied at the chest and a strap of material over the left shoulder. The head of the statue is significantly oversized, with elaborate modelling of the skull which is emphasised further by the baldness of the head. There are notable deep wrinkles and folds of the skin which convey the figure\u2019s mature age, particularly along the brow and sides of the mouth. The broad nose, thin lips, protruding ears and deep-set eyes also suggest an individualised portrait. Sematawy\u2019s hands are placed on either side of the naos walls and within the shrine is the standing image of the god Atum, who is identifiable through the royal double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. On the reverse, the slim back-pillar is inscribed with two columns of hieroglyphic text, with the final section of both lines now lost. The front of the naos also has a brief horizontal inscription underneath the image of Atum. There are small chips to the stone surface at the chest and ridges of the clothing, and along both inner arms towards the naos, with a small break in the top left corner of the naos. The feet and statue base have been restored in modern times.

This statue type became particularly popular in the later phases of Egyptian history and was still used into the Graeco-Roman period. During the Ptolemaic Period, well-established Egyptian artistic traditions were combined with new elements such as Hellenistic artistic influences which had an impact on both royal and private sculpture. \u2018Portrait heads\u2019 of non-royal male figures such as this example with facial features that indicate an older age through wrinkles and folds of the skin were often removed from their bodies by later collectors who valued the \u2018Roman\u2019 appearance of such sculpture. While other known examples retain Egyptian facial features, here Sematawy has adopted various elements of the later Hellenistic style. Though there is no recorded provenance for the statue, the mentions of Sais within the inscription could suggest that the statue was originally established in this area. Further Bibliography: B.V.
