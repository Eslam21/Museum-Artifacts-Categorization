{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1162"], "Description": [" Grey siltstone statue of the goddess Isis with her wings wrapped protectively around the smaller image of the god Osiris. Isis wears a modius cylindrical crown topped with the sun-disc and horns, on top of a long and smooth wig which is set low and tucked behind the ears. Above her forehead is the raised hood and head of the uraeus cobra. She wears a tight-fitting sheath dress with a delineated neckline, and her nipples and the outline of her legs are emphasised through the clothing. Her carved wings emerge from the lower back area and reach around to the sides of the statue, with the stone merging into the top of the statue base. The smaller figure of the god Osiris stands on his own plinth, bringing his overall height to Isis\u2019 torso. Osiris is identifiable via his mummified form, the feathered atef-crown, false beard and the crook and flail implements held across his chest. Both of Isis\u2019 hands are placed at the arms of Osiris\u2019 figure, supporting his image. Along the top of Osiris\u2019 plinth, a short horizontal line of text provides his name and epithets and bears the name of Sheshonq, a male official and the dedicator of the monument. Two horizontal lines of hieroglyphic text are also inscribed on the top of the statue base in front of Osiris\u2019 image which are oriented towards the living viewer. This text continues in a line inscribed around the edges of the statue base, beginning at the front of the statue and moving around to the right. On the reverse behind Isis is a slim back-pillar which is uninscribed. Both figures are in good condition though there is some damage to Isis\u2019 face, with the tip of her nose now broken off and visible chips to the mouth area, her right eyebrow and the edges of the uraeus.

The God\u2019s Wife of Amun was an important religious office which became increasingly influential throughout the Third Intermediate Period and Late Period. Associated titles included \u2018Divine Adoratrice of Amun\u2019, and the females who performed this role were intimately connected to the Theban area as demonstrated by their burials within the Medinet Habu complex of Ramesses III. Though her name is not given here, Sheshonq is believed to have served under the God\u2019s Wife Ankhnesneferibre in the 26th Dynasty. Two male officials both named Sheshonq are known to have acted as chief stewards in the lifetime of Ankhnesneferibre, therefore it\u2019s not possible to identify which Sheshonq is being commemorated within this particular monument. The name Sheshonq is of Libyan origin, belonging to several kings of the Libyan Period, but it also became popular among Egyptians from that time onwards. His text features requests from the goddess as a reward for his efforts and devotion, including a long life, a proper burial, and for his name to endure. Though no clear site is mentioned or evoked, this statue is believed to have originally been established within the Osirian chapels at the temple of Karnak, which were actively built upon and enhanced by several of the God\u2019s Wives of Amun during the Third Intermediate and Late Period (PM II).
