This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). For similar double-sided Bes from Naukratis: Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology & Anthropology E140; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,69. On amulets of Bes in general see: Andrews 1994, 38-40; Herrmann et al. 2010, 69-73 (type 34). Considering its context of discovery, which is recorded in the museum's register, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
