{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86899"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration with a partly glossy surface. The rear shows two rows of basketry coils. The front has a small flat area on which part of an oval scarab-like seal-impression is preserved, partly covered by finger prints. The seal-impression shows a thin circumferential line. In the centre a cartouche with Mn-kheper-R' and on each side of a small winged scarab rotated with its heads towards the cartouche. Probably identical seal on EA86819, EA86894 and EA86897. Some black discolouration is found on the surface that might be due to fire.
