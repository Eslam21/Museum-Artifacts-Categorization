{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "98", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "OFFERING TABLE (Htp)", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF; ENGRAVED", "Height": "22.5 cm", "Width": "32 cm", "Depth": "7 cm", "Name": "Offering table of Intef", "Description": "The offering table bears the following gifts on either side of its water outlet: a libation, bread, an ox leg, a goose and a rib section as well as two libation cups. Without doubt it stems from a family tomb because in the inscription around its border the recipients of the offerings are listed as brothers, sisters, and two other persons who are also probably relatives. This type of offering table was placed in front of the false door in the offering chapel of the tomb. The gifts for the deceased were placed on top of them."}
