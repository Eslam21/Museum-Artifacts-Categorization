{"artifact_name": "artefact", "Object Type": ["artefact"], "Museum number": ["EA23668"], "Description": [" Redware pottery object in form of dish with central round hole; repaired from fragments (one lost). The red siltware fabric has inclusions of sand and grit, especially small quartz grains, and the core is a blue-grey colour. The surfaces were covered by a bright red slip, much of which still remains in place. The central hole was made pre-firing from the exterior of the base; creating it caused a slight ridge of clay to form around its perimeter on the interior.
