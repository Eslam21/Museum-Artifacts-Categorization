{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a human-headed bird or cat (sphinx?). The figure is shown in a highly schematic way. The front legs crudely indicated, they are strictly parallel, straight and in a closed position. There is no indication of a tail. Whitish limestone, surface brown and shiny (from handling?), details of hair picked; stone seems fairly heavy and solid. The surface is very smooth.

Petrie dated these, with other limestone figures, between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886, 40, pl.19.1&3), though one was found in a Ptolemaic level (ibid.). Hogarth found one in a \u20185th century BC\u2019 well deposit (Hogarth 1905, 122; Hogarth Diary 24-25/04/1903, well 2 bottom). These are identical style to the \u2018concubine\u2019 and drummer figures of the Saite period, also found in the mid 6th century BC levels of the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, 40, Level 335). Unprovenanced Late Period parallel (Petrie Museum UC59370). Some of the highly varied deviations from this form, such as lying sphinxes, may be later in date (British Museum 1886,0401.1396 and 1886,0401.1485), as they have Late Period or Ptolemaic parallels from Memphis (Anthes 1959; 1965, see also in terracotta Ashton 2003a, 77, Petrie Museum, UC 48012-6; Nicholson & Thomas 2013, 73, P-390) and Saqq\u00e2ra (Quibbel 1907, pl.30.6a-c; see also in terracotta Jeffreys et. al. 1988, fig. 64, nos.77/308 and 77/u 209) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC60105, see also in terracotta T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 126; 98-9, pl.65, no. 129).
