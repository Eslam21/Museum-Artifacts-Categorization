{"artifact_name": "print; satirical print", "Object Type": [" print ", " satirical print "], "Museum number": ["1868,0808.10394"], "Title": ["Object: Phaeton alarm'd!"], "Description": [" After the title: '\"Now all the horrors of the heav'ns he spies, \"And monstrous shadows of prodigious size, That, deck'd with stars, lie scatter'd o'er the skies. - \"Th' astonish'd youth, where-e'er his eyes could turn, \"Beheld the universe around him burn: \"The world was in a blaze!\" - See, Ovid's Metamorphoses.' Canning, as Phaeton, drives his chariot with four horses abreast on a curving track across the heavens, slanting upwards across the design from left. to r. On this are signs of the zodiac; other constellations of the zodiac are on the darkened sky, above and below the path of Phaeton; all assail him. The base of the design is part of the northern hemisphere, showing the world in flames, and flanked by the ghosts of Pitt and Fox. In the lower left. corner is the ghost of Pitt as Apollo (half length); he weeps, dropping his lyre, and raises his shroud to gaze up at his son, Phaeton. He is surrounded by heavy clouds. In the opposite corner, the head and shoulders of Fox as 'Pluto', holding a pitchfork, emerge from flames: he looks up with sinister anxiety at the conflict in the heavens. Canning's head is the centre of an irradiated sun: 'The Sun of Anti-Jacobinism.' He is heroic, youthful, and naked, except for floating draperies. Above him (l.) is a crescent moon. His horses have human heads set behind equine jaws and nostrils which jet flame. They are (l. to r.): Hawkesbury, Perceval, Castlereagh (with a profile expressive of nobility), Eldon (sub-human). Flame streams backwards from the chariot wheels; the wheels pass over the (dismantled) scales, 'Libra-Britannicus' [British justice], one scale inscribed 'Copenhagen'. Close behind the chariot the British Lion, 'Leo Britannicus', rushes furiously; on the chariot's track, facing the horses, is the Ram (faintly sketched). Behind this is Taurus, a ferocious Irish bull, snorting fire at the horses. His collar is inscribed 'Erin go Bragh'; from it flies a rosary; to his tail is tied a pot inscribed 'Emancipation'. The most conspicuous assailant of the horses is 'Scorpio Broad-Bottom', with the head of Grenville, the words inscribed on the two ferocious claws, in which his arms terminate. (He is the Scorpion who 'bends out his arms into two bows, . . . [and] spreads over the space of two signs'.) The body spirals into a barbed tail, emitting names close to Fox. Smaller claws terminate in human heads (below, l. to r.): Temple, Spencer (both spitting fire), Bedford; (above, l. to r.): Moira, Tierney. Covering Grenville's posterior is an irregular circle. In its centre is an irradiated ring enclosing a chalice with the Host; round this are irradiated heads: Grafton, Stanhope, Derby, Carlisle, Norfolk, Holland. Flame and a barbed tongue issue from Grenville's mouth. Other constellations below Canning's path are (l. to r.) 'Sagittarius': Windham, as a centaur, aims his bow at Canning. Next is 'Cancer', a large malevolent head (St. Vincent's) between a pair of crab's claws. Then 'Silenus' [Sheridan], naked and gross, garlanded with vine-leaves, bestrides a small ass which snorts fire towards Canning; he brandishes in each hand a bottle of 'Port'. These three constellations are reached by thunder-bolts which dart from the irradiation of Canning's sun (l.). Four constellations above the sun try to extinguish it by dashing liquid against it. These are (l. to r.): Petty, as 'Pisces', who ejects a cascade of water. Whitbread, as 'Aquarius', holds up a cask of 'Small Beer', the contents gushing from the bung-hole. Sidmouth, as 'Sangradarius' [Dr. Sangrado as in BMSat 9986], squirts his clyster-pipe. The head of Erskine, as 'Astrea' [Justice], spits venom. He has a long neck issuing from an elongated Chancellor's wig which streams behind him, terminating in flame. All these liquid attacks dash harmlessly against the circumference of the sun. The other constellations, in the upper right. corner, are, like their neighbour the Irish bull, attacking Canning's horses. They are Ellenborough as Hercules, wrapped in a lion's skin, and wielding a 'Herculanean Club'. Particularly menacing is 'Python' [Serpens] [Ovid, 'Metamorphoses', i. 150.] with the head of Grey (inveterate enemy of Canning) in profile, with a long serpentine body and webbed wings-fanged jaws project from his profile, emitting flames and a barbed tongue (cf. BMSat 10992). In a loop formed by his body flies a little bird of prey 'Aquila', with the head of Lauderdale, wearing a bonnet rouge, and spitting flame. Below, the arc of the globe stretches from Pitt to Fox; on it is a map of the northern hemisphere from America to 'Tartary'. 'America', 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'France', 'Britain', 'Holland', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Turkey', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Poland', the 'Russian Empire', and 'Persia' are in flames. In the flames arising from northern Europe is a double-headed eagle. From behind the globe rise the figures of 'Neptune', dropping his trident in horror, and a huge (Russian) bear, 'Ursa Major', on which a tiny Napoleon rides triumphantly among the flames, sabre in hand. The background, which represents the sky, is dark, except where it is irradiated, or patterned with stars, fixed and shooting. 22 March 1808.

According to the allegory, Canning will be hurled to destruction for his presumption in driving the horses of the sun, that is of his father Apollo, or Pitt (cf. BMSat 8644). The presumption seems to be the Copenhagen expedition, see BMSat 10762. But Canning himself is the Sun of Anti-Jacobinism (cf. BMSat 9240) and the thunderbolts are directed against his enemies. The flames of war have reached America: for the fighting at Buenos Ayres see BMSat 10974, &c. Disputes over the blockade threatened to embroil the United States with Britain, see BMSat 10626. Turkey had come into the war zone by the expedition to the Dardanelles, see BMSat 11391, and the invasion of Egypt (evacuated Sept. 1807). For Napoleon and Europe cf. BMSat 10970. For Opposition factiousness see M. Roberts, 'The Whig Party, 1807-1812', 1939, pp. 110ff. St. Vincent (cf. BMSat 10576) was brought forward to testify that Zeeland was easily defensible against an army in Jutland. 'Parl. Debates', x. 375 (8 Feb.).
