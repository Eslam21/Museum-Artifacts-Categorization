It consists of a circle surmounted by a triangular section, or throne, to which a ring for suspension is attached. The inscription on the throne is a Qur\u2019anic phrase, \u2018God is the best guardian\u2019. The body of the astrolabe has an outer rim and is indented on the front surface to hold a disc which is incised with markings for the latitudes of Cairo and Alexandria. The hole in the centre of the disc and the surface of the astrolabe are pierced by a pin which attaches to a horizontal bar, the \u2018alidad\u2019, on the back and a movable \u2018spider\u2019 or rete on the front. The shape of this rete is very unusual. Astrolabes were used to measure altitudes, determine the time, to establish the direction of Mecca, to solve astronomical problems and to compile horoscopes. The following are the Arabic names for the component parts of the astrolabe which are held together by a pin (faras). 1) Pin (faras) 2) Rete (\u2018ankabut) 3) Plates (lawhat) 4) Mater (umm) 5) Alidade (al-\u2018idada) 6) Throne (kursi) 7) Ring (halqa) Gunther, R.T.
