{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "7512", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS OF HUMANS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "73 cm", "Width": "72 cm", "Name": "Double chest coffin", "Description": "This coffin was obviously cut from an older larger coffin. At several places on the lid and the boards of the chest are slits for flat dowels and pierced holes for round dowels without matching counterparts on the opposite sides. This indicates that the boards, especially of the lid, were reassembled differently when reused. The four sides of the coffin and the bottom were tied together with rope; the lid of the inner coffin was also tied with rope to that of the outer coffin."}
