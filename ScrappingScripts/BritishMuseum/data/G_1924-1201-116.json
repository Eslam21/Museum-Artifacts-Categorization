Unlike most other sherds in this category, however, the interior decoration is not quite so isolated. The sherd ought to belong to the later period of the Wild Goat Style since, although the metope pattern decoration on the exterior surface is typical of the Wild Goat Style, the lotus decoration on the interior, which is absent during this period, is typical in the later reserved Animal Chalice, Grand and Chalice styles. Furthermore, geese are extremely rarely portrayed in the Mature Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
