The gilded face is dominated by the widely opened black eyes with their blue make-up lines and brows. The slightly smiling mouth which is uncoloured is not as prominent as the eyes. The decorative collar and the diadem of roses and udjat eyes have been gilded. The long wig has also been gilded, but it has received an additional red frame which renders it more distinct. The ends of the wig are decorated with colourful bands and a frieze of uraei with solar disks. On the back of the mask are two kneeling goddesses with their arms raised, depicted on either side of the knot of the diadem. Beneath it are two winged goddesses flanking a Djed-symbol."}
