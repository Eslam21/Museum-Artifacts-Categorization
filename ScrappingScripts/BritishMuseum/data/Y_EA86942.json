The rear shows a slightly convex surface like from a leather bag, perpendicular to it two impressions of an unturned cord with a width of 0.2 cm in the break. The front has a small flat area which bends downwards to both lateral sides. On the flat area half of an oval scarab-like seal-impression preserved with finger imprints around it.
