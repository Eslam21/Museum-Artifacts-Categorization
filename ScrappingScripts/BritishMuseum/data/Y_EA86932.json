{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86932"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression showing impressions of one convex coil of basketry on one side, probably the rim, and another coil of basketry on the second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows an almost complete impression of a scarab-like seal with disturbance in the middle part of the seal, few finger impressions around it. At the top right corner a small hole through the seal, maybe originally from a string. The seal impression is cut very sharply and shows a circumferential line that thickens at the top. Visible is a bound captive on the left side, kneeling, facing towards the left, with his hands bound together at his back. Behind him on the right a seated lion with its front paws on the shoulder of the captive. Behind the back of the lion a small upright cobra, facing to the right. Underneath a bound captive, lying on his belly, with his hands and feet bound backwards, not completely preserved. The same motif can be found on EA86927, EA86928, EA86930, EA86931, EA86933 and EA86934.
