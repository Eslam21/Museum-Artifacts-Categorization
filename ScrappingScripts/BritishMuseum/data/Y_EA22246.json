The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). Twelve offering-cups were discovered in the foundation deposits: three in the north-east corner, four in the south-east one, one in the south-west one and four in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. 25 no. 14-17). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-west corner of the pylon, along with three others. The cup is also pencilled marked with NW, confirming its context of discovery. Small faience vessels tend to act as substitute of ceramics\u2019 models in the foundation deposits of the Ptolemaic period (Weinstein 1973, 356-357). They are often just small cups like this one, but they can reproduce more complex vase shapes (for example a double Hes-vase from a foundation deposit at Herakleion-Thonis: Goddio, Fabre 2008, 138-139, no. 390).
