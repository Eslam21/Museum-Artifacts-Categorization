{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62006", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "FAN", "Material": "EBONY", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; INLAY", "Height": "69 cm", "Name": "Ebony Fan of Tutankhamun", "Description": "This fan is made of ebony, veneered to look like tree bark. It was originally fitted with 48 ostrich feathers, traces of which are preserved. The ostrich plumes were attached to the edges of a flat section. It is decorated with the king's cartouche below the two plumes of the god Amun. The \"Neb\" sign of gold is attached to the bottom as if the king wanted to show that he had returned to the cult of Amun and that he is the \"Golden King\". More flabellums, or fans, of different styles were found in the annex of King Tutankhamun's tomb, the Treasury, and within the shrines. Because all these fans were needed during the lifetime of the king, they were placed in the tomb to be used in the afterlife."}
