", " Amulets of ducks are usually considered to represent food offerings. The duck is often depicted with its head turned back, resting on its wings; such position could also imply that the bird is sleeping and would then \"symbolises the promise of reawakening and resurrection\" (Andrews 1994, 92, fig. 54d and 60b). In other instances, it is lying awake with its head to the front, like for this specimen. Its function as an amulet is less clear in that case (believed to still represent foodstuff or to yield an erotic meaning: Andrews 1994, 92). Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
