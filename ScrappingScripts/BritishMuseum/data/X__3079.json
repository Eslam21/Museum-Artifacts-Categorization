", " A copper alloy open ring with an irregularly shaped hammered bezel is a common Mediterranean type that probably originated in Cyprus (Gjerstad 1948, 390), but with 6th century BC examples from sites such as Ialysos (Jacopi 1929, 209, fig. 204, 13) and Tharros (Pisano 1987, 84, pl. 40a). While other examples are generally plain, the Naukratis piece has three roughly incised Egyptian hieroglyphic characters on the bezel, which are difficult to read. This ring may be a local Egyptian emulation of a common Mediterranean type, or a local reworking of an imported piece. Gjerstad, E. 1948, The Swedish Cyprus Expedition. IV/2.
