The original drawing is kept in the D\u00e9partement des Arts Graphiques, Louvre (Inv. 8051) where it is catalogued as a work by P. F. Mola. However, while discussing a plate engraved after the same drawing for the \"Recueil Jabach\", Stephen Bailey proposes to attribute it to Annibale Carracci (\"Carracci landscape studies: the drawings related to the 'Recueil de 283 Estampes de Jabach'\", 1993, No.11, p.144-145). Catherine Loisel did not include the Louvre drawing in her catalogue of the Carracci drawings kept in the Louvre (\"Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des dessins italiens, VII : Ludovico, Agostino, Annibale Carracci\", Paris, 2004)."], "Bibliographic references": ["IFF / Inventaire du Fonds Fran\u00e7ais: Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, D\u00e9partement des Estampes (163)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Holy Family"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: R Hampton"], "Acquisition date": ["1965"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1965,0319.2.58"]}
