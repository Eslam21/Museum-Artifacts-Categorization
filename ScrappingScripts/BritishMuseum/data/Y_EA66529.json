This specimen decorated with a winged seated griffin is comparable to motifs published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos 20-22. This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A184-188). It should correspond to Gorton A184, though this number is used for two different scaraboids, this one which is decorated with a seated winged griffin and another one decorated with a seated lion (BM 1886,0401.1627).
