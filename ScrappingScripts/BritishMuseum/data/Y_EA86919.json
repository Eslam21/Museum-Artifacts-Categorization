{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86919"], "Description": [" Small but complete seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows two coils of basketry on one side and one coil of basketry on a second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side is flat with the lateral sides bending downwards, showing many finger imprints. About the lower half of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable are two of three lines in hieroglyphs, the missing lines are preserved on EA86907 and EA86918. On EA86918 the upper row is preserved showing a very small cartouche with at least 4 signs, but a crack is running through it. The second and third lines are preserved on EA86907 and on this seal-impression EA86919. The second line is written from the right to the left: 'Imn-[R'], nfr, underneath the third row is written from the left to the right: Hr (D2) wDA.t (D10).
