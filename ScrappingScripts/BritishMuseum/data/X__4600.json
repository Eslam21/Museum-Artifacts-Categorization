", " Socketed trilobate type arrow-heads are common in the Middle East from the 7th century BC and subsequently in Greece and Egypt. During the course of the 4th century BC arrow heads tend to become larger and this short type is abandoned. Parallels from Olympia are tentatively given a Classical date of the 5th to early 4th century BC (Baitinger 2001, fig. 472 Dreifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IID3). This type is cited as evidence by Snodgrass of Persian archers at the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae and was adopted in Greece subsequently, though this type is dated elsewhere to the 7th century BC onwards (Snodgrass 1964, 154 small \u2018Scythian\u2019, \u2018pyramidal\u2019 socketed bronze Form 3C3; 1967, 99; Erdmann 1973, 45 \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Form CIIc2 dated to 7th or 6th to 4th centuries BC). Parallels are known from Tell Dafana and the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.6, 44 dated to late 7th to 6th centuries BC).
