He was buried in a huge mastaba, or tomb, at Meidum. From that mastaba came the magnificent painted panel of \"the Geese of Meidum\" and these fragments, which show desert hunting scenes. For the first and last time in the history of Egyptian art, the scenes were made by cutting them in sunken relief and then filling them with colored paste inlay. When the paste dried, it fell out and the new technique was abandoned. The upper register, or section, depicts a man approaching a leopard from behind, while in the lower register, a dog is attacking three foxes."}
