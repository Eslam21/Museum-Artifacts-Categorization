It was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, notably on Punic sites and in the Levant (Gorton 1996, 112-114, type XXXI, subtype 3-18, see particularly 15 for this piece). Petrie interpreted the inscription as the name of Sheshonq IV, a pharaoh of the 22nd Dynasty (Petrie 1889, pl. 57, no. 1811). The inscription, however, could be understood as an abreviation of Menkheperra, the royal name of Thutmosis III which is also an epithet for Amun extremely common on Egyptian scarabs (Jaeger 1982).
