The central motif, which resembles the iconography of  bracelets and pectorals, shows a winged scarab, symbol of the rising sun. Its front legs hold a large sun-disk. Its body is flanked by two cobras whose heads are surmounted by  sun-disks framed with cow horns. All these symbols emphasize the solar character of the text, written on four horizontal lines beneath the scene. It is a small hymn adressed to the sun."}
