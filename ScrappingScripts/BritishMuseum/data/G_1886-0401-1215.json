{"artifact_name": "acroterion", "Object Type": ["acroterion"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1215"], "Description": [" Fragment of a marble acroterion palmetto. Two adjoined fragments of a, on both sides elaborated, palmetto with curved leaves. The presumable front side is smoothly shaped and shows three crooked and upwards widening coves which are seamed by platelets and is separated by deep cut ridges. Furthermore the whole front side is convex curved. Broad and convex bulges on the back side correspond to the coves, between those narrow and light notched ovolo mouldings stand. The back surface is in general concave curved, however, in such an extent that the lower part is considerably thicker than the upper part. Light grey marble. Traces of red.

Its leaves were concave on the front side and on the back side convex. Between the leaves darts are visible. These are characterised by a ridge leading downwards to the nucleus (see also Koenigs 2007, Cat. 34, Pl. 24, 25). Based on its bilateral shaping the palmetto is put in connection with the acroterion of a building, for the backside of steles during the Archaic and Classical period were shaped with closed contours (E. Buschor, AM 38, 1933, 34ff. V 4 and VI 2; M. Mpenaki 2002, 83-92; K. Tsakos 2001, 451-466). Comparable acroteria are those in Aegina and Paros as well as Apollina and Epirus, although the latter has a flat back side (A. Furtwaengler 1906, 274ff. Pl. 49. 51. 53. 55; A. Ohnesorg1991, 130ff. Pl. 88).
