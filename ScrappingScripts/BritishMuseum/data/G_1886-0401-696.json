These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. The number 167 is written in ink on the underside of the foot."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
