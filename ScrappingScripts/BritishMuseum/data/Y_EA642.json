{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA642"], "Description": [" Limestone tomb stela of Psusennes: shows Psusennes offering to Osiris, to his son the falcon-headed Horus, and to his wife, Isis. The spirit of the New Kingdom persists here in Psusennes' elaborate costume and wig, the ragged edge of which represents curled ends, and to some extent in the proportions of the figures. As always, the divine figures are rendered in a more conservative manner. Instead of the flowing robes typically shown on female figures of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Dynasties, Isis wears the traditional tight sheath dress, and her figure lacks the bulging thighs depicted on mortal women of this time. As Osiris' queen, Isis here wears a vulture cap, with the bird's tail standing out behind her head like a little ruffle. The cap is crowned with a platform for hieroglyphs that spell her name. Horus' royal status is symbolized by his double crown and bull's tail. Osiris, mummiform, wears a white crown flanked by Maat feathers, a divine beard, and a large collar necklace, like those represented on anthropoid coffins of this period, with a counterweight at the back. Though the sunk relief figures are well carved, they are very crowded. Apparently the draftsman who drew the scene had been instructed to make the figures as large as possible. In doing so, he drew Psusennes' arm in such a way that it hides part of Osiris' crook, flail, and was scepter. Instead of an Isis knot, which has obviously been recarved over an erasure, Psusennes was originally profferring a figure of the goddess Maat. There are ten columns of hieroglyphic text above the scene and five rows below.
