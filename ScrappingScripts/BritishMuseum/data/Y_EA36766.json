{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA36766"], "Description": [" Flat, ornamental axe-head: with original wooden haft and black leather binding. It is asymmetrical in shape with an inclined butt and a relatively broad waist with slightly incurved sides. It is certainly non-functional. Most of the corrosion product which covered it at the time of acquisition has been cleaned off. There are small superficial pits all over the blade and there is a nick in the upper corner of the cutting end. Grinding marks are also visible in several places, most noticeably at the cutting end, but the edge was never fully sharpened. The blade bears an openwork decoration of rather indifferent workmanship, representing a man or deity riding on the back of a galloping horse with, before them, a floral motif consisting of two papyrus flowers, one above the other, the upper inverted on the lower. The internal detail was lightly chased in rather cursory fashion and was never fully completed. The figure appears to be riding 'side-saddle' with the forward hand holding the looped end of a rein. The right hand is probably to be understood as holding the end of the other rein, a small section of which is shown beneath the forward elbow. On one face, the rider is represented wearing a long wig, which covers the ear, together with a necklace or collar. The eye is indicated but not the nose or mouth. On the other face, the head of the figure has been left blank. On neither face is there any indication of dress on the body of the rider, or of the horse's harness, but the horse itself is well detailed on both. Inconsistency is also observable in the treatment of the flowers, one of which lacks the internal striations. The haft consists of a curved piece of wood of varying section. It has several cracks in it. Its butt-end is painted black and its shaft is decorated with black stripes, arranged in a criss-cross pattern, on a reddish-brown base. The stripes are now much faded. The blade was bound to the haft by means of a leather thong, much of which still survives but in a brittle and degenerate state. Bits of reed and grass adhere to it.
