", " Several of these amulets were discovered in Naukratis, almost all being quite to very schematic. Therefore it is often difficult to identify properly the deity represented. His attitude, kneeling with his hands raised on both sides of his head, relates to the gods Shu or Heh (on both types of amulets: Andrews 1994, 19 and 88-89; Herrmann et al. 2010, 51-52, type 20). Since their iconography can be very close, Herrmann prefers to not decide between both deities (Herrmann 2006, 88-92, Pl. XX-XXII). Such amulets are very common on Late Period settlements (Masson forthcoming). Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
