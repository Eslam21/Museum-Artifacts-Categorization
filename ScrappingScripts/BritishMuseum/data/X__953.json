", " The association of the throne name of Thutmose III (\u201cMenkheperra\u201d) with the epithet \"image of Amun\" or \"of Amun-Ra\" on scarabs is very common. As stated by Hornung and Staehelin (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 240, Pl. 24 no. 249), it comes in different arrangements and with various additional elements (see for example: Hall 1913, no. 705-753; Rowe 1936, pl. XII nos. 487 and 496; Matouk 1971, S. 213 no. 453-455; Jaeger 1982, fig. 194). Such composition was most likely used well after the reign of Thutmose III (Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 1090; specimen with winged sun no. 26 dated between 19th and 25th dynasty). See also two scarabs with a similar formula dated to the 25th dynasty: Magnarini 2004, 395-6, nos 11.51-2. Since the Museum register mentions that it was found in the Scarab Factory, a 26th Dynasty date could be a possibility. However, the Scarab Factory is a findspot that has been reported for scarabs and scaraboids of a secure earlier date. Jaeger, B. 1982.
