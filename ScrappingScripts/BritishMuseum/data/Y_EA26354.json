The surface of the shrine is smooth, with no clear evidence of any incised detail. The deep space carved into the front of the shrine does not appear to have held a figure or object, as there\u2019s no clear socket or base missing from inside the shrine. On the reverse there appears to be faint traces of a painted figure in black, this could possibly represent a scarab figure.
