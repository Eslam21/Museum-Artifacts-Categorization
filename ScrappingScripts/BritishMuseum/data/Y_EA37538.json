Variations of the motif include a kneeling figure holding a was-sceptre, a lotus or a papyrus flower, flanked by two uraei (Hornung, Staehelin 1976, 365, no. 897). As a parallel, see scarab with similar motif from Palestine (Tufnell 1984, 132, class 9C2, pl. 37, no. 2530-2540) and a scarab from Tell el-Ajjul for the shape of the uraei and of the scarab itself (Giveon 1985, 88, no. 77; Petrie 1931, vol. 3, pl. 3, 71). A comparable treatment of the back is found on other scarabs from Naukratis that can be dated to the Second Intermediate Period: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.857; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.3; Birmingham City Museum & Art Gallery 1888A195.1. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
