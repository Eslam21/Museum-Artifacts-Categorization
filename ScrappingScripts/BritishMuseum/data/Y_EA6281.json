{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA6281"], "Description": [" Bead of square section. The bead is in opaque dark-blue glass with cylindrical vertical piercing. Impressed on each face a continuous undulating serpent in opaque yellow, white, brown, and orange. At upper and lower edge of each face a monochrome orange border was impressed quite unskilfully. These borders were applied first as in several places the serpents overlap them. Poor work. The surface is extensively chipped.
