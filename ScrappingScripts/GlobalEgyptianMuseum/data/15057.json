He was shown standing with his left leg forward, but his legs are now lost. He is wearing the Pschent, the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, over the Nemes, the traditional headdress decorated with the royal cobra, or uraeus. He also wears the starched triangular royal kilt decorated with a long belt reaching the hem of the kilt. The belt is flanked by two cobras. His arms are not by his sides as is usual. His left forearm is bent horizontally on his stomach, indicating that he was holding an object, now missing. All the details are very well portrayed by the sculptor. They reveal a profound knowledge of human anatomy, expressed clearly in the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and arms."}
