Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains medical texts, possibly for healing. On the verso there is a diary of an embalmment with ruled lines. The text is written in horizontal lines. This frame contains a single page. The papyrus was a half-height roll. Gardiner describes the verso as follows: 'the verso, of which a schematic transcription is shown opposite in Fig. 1, recorded in vertical columns seventy-seven consecutive days divided into seven-days periods, the last day of each of which has written against it the sign for 'total' (dmD), followed by the word for 'purification' (wabt). With the number indicating its place in the series, it looks as though this were the diary of an embalmment or the like' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 14). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
