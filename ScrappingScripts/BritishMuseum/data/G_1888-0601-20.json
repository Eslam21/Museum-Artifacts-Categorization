{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.20"], "Description": [" Grey limestone statuette of a young huntsman. Young huntsman; the left foot and part of the right restored, also parts of the bow and left hand. Rejoined at neck, knee and base. A youth standing on an unevenly worked plinth, left leg advanced, both heels are on the ground. He wears a close fitting Cypriot cap with turned up ear-pieces, a short chiton with short sleeves, tied at the waist and tanged at the lower edge, and with an overfold falling in flaps on either side. Over each shoulder is slung a pair of animals; on the right, a young boar in front, a hare behind; on the left, the same animals in reversed position. The right arm hangs stiffly at the side, holding arrows; the left arm is bent up, holding a bow which is depicted as a disc in the shape of a segment of a circle. The feet are bare from the knees; the stone between them is not cut away. The kneecap is eye-shaped. The face is square and rather large in comparison with the rest of the body, the eyes are large and almond-shaped, with projecting pupils; the mouth is straight, the nose worn away. Down the back of the right leg is an inscription.

Parallels in representation of the legs and knees can be found in the kouroi from the Tenea-Volomandra and Melos groups, the face bears resemblance with a head from Didyma and a statuette from Idalion. The type of chiton represented finds parallels in a limestone statuette from Potamia and a figure from Kazaphani. The stone left between the legs is a typical feature of Egyptian stone statues. The topic of the hunter is unusual in Cypriot art, however, the Cypriot Herakles bears some elements found in this statue; the theme of hunting hares is not uncommon in Egyptian depictions. Certain clothing elements, like the cap and the belt, place it in a Cypriot context. (Nick, 2006, 35-39). The inscription, in Ionic letters, is not fully preserved and readings have differed. Name Kallias. Marshall assigns the inscription to the fifth century, which would make it a subsequent addition (see Nick, 2006, 39), but see Johnston, 2003.
