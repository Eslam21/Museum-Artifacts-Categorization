Even though it cannot be proven, it may well be a youthful portrait of Ramesses II. The stripes on the headcloth were once painted yellow, but on the left they were never executed. The face has narrow eyes below naturalistically formed lids and brows. The mouth is small and shows a faint smile, which adds much to the overall impression of the face. The highly placed ears are distinctive, with the lobes of both ears pierced. The chin bears the remains of the royal ceremonial beard."}
