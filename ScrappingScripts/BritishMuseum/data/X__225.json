", " Similar parallels of standing kore (GR1860,0404.57 from Kamiros), seated kore (GR1886,0401.1398 also Naukratis) or as alabastron (GR1861,0425.34 from Kamiros) all in similar micaceous orange fabric and all dated late 6th century BC (Higgins 1954, no.61). Parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525 BC - 400 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2118). Originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9), but probably Milesian as Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). Naukratis Kore heads British Museum GR1886,0401.1400 and 1421 and Cambridge MCA NA321 and NA 324, all have a similar micaceous orange fabric.
