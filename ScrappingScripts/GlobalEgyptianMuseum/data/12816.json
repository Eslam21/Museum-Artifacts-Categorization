Decorated area demarcated by incised border of double line below, and on the other three sides a band comprising outer double line on each side and inner divisions of groups of four lines at regular intervals, with Xqr frieze along top. Within this border a narrow double line separates the main text and image field from an upper field containing wDA.tj eyes and on each side a jackal on a standard. Traces of red pigment remain in the pupil and whites of the eyes, and blue pigment survives in the front part of both falcon-markings. The right part of the lower field contains three vertical lines of neatly cut and spaced hieroglyphs with some traces of blue pigment in the Htp, st and kA signs and in the dividing-line adjacent to the kA sign. The illustration consists of the central offering-table, laden with cattle head, tall rounded loaf, tied bunch of onions, gourd, and a goose. To the left sits the owner on a lion-legged chair; he wears a short plain wig, leaving the ear exposed, plain collar, short plain kilt with belt, with one hand extended to the knee, and the other holding a kerchief to his chest. Traces of red pigment are visible along the edges of the figures."}
