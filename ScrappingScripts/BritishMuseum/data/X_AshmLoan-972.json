", " The exterior decoration finds parallels with South Ionian mugs and Samian Hera cups but the presence of added red and white bands is not typical of Hera cups. Furthermore, graffito inscriptions do not feature on Hera cups but they do on South Ionian mugs. However, the inscriptions are usually on the exterior surface of the vessel. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888, 0601.405. For a similar South Ionian mug with a graffito inscription, see Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.227.1899.
