The handle has disappeared; it was probably carved in bone or ivory like other examples found at Kerma. The three rivets that had held the blade to the handle are still in place. It cannot be determined whether this object is an Egyptian import or not. It could have been produced locally as copper mines are known to have existed in Nubia and copper workshops were found at Kerma and in nearby regions, but from a slightly more recent period. "}
