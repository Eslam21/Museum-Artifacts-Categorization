It was also interpreted as a model steering-oar from sacred boat from a model funerary barge or, judging by its size, from the processional bark of a god; the well-carved jackal-head on the butt suggest either Anubis or Wepwawet. The blade is slightly flattened and widened continuation of the loom, without a shoulder, and the loom is stout. Most of the length has been covered with a black substence containing beeswax, oil or fat, and a small amount of bitumen, which has been spread patchily over a considerable part of the surface and the jackal-head.
