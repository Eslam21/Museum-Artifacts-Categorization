These notes were presumably written in 1884-1885 when Petrie excavated at Naukratis, although they could have been written in 1885-1886, when he visited the site. Although not definitely from Naukratis, this is the most likely provenance. This shell has unclear pencil writing : 2 la. Same shell as 2012,5015.1, which has a note by Petrie: 'Pectunailus zonalis Medit.
