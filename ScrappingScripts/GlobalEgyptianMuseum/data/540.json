Situated in the necropolis of Saqqara, this place of pilgrimage shelters the tombs of the sacred bulls. The stela has been offered by a certain Harsiesis, who fulfilled priestly duties at Sais and Buto, two towns in the Delta.

The text, written in five horizontal lines, is limited to the names, titles and filiation of the owner."}
