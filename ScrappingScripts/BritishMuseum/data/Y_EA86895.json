{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86895"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration with a partly glossy surface. The rear shows two sides with each two rows of basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front has a slightly concave but flat area showing parts of an oval scarab-like seal-impression that is partly covered by finger imprints. Visible is a standing animal like a horse (?) with bent head and underneath turned by 180 degrees a crocodile with long tail whose curve follows the outline of the seal. A small hole between the legs of the horse. The same motif is found on EA86942, EA86947 and EA86948.
