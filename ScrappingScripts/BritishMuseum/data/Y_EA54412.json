Superimposed in raised relief on its front are three other hieroglyphic symbols: a 'was'-sceptre placed on the pillar-like 'djed'-sign, and the kneeling figure of the heh-sign on the top of the 'djed'-pillar. The amulet's reverse is nearly identical except that the 'was'-sceptre is lacking.

Because of its size and the absence of a lug by which to suspend it, it was probably made to be carried. The magical properties of this amulet and the benefits it was to bestow on its owner are clearly expressed through the four hieroglyphic symbols of which it is composed: life ('ankh'), endurance ('djed') and dominion ('was'-sceptre) for millions and millions of years ('heh') - enduring domination and rule by its royal owner. This 'ankh'-amulet was one of two purchased by the British Museum from the collection of Lord Kitchener, and are said to have been purchased by him in the Sudan in 1919 from Mohammed Ahasi. Probably Egyptian imports into Nubia, records indicate that they may have come from the Temple of Taharqo (B 300) at Gebel Barkal, the capital of the ancient Nubian kingdom of Napata whose early kings ruled Egypt as the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty (c. 770-657 BC). Taharqo was one of the most important kings of this dynasty, completing the Kushite conquest of Egypt begun by his ancestors. Like many other traditional Egyptian religious symbols, Egyptian-style amulets were widely used by ancient Nubian kings. 'Ankh'-shaped amulets continued to be made even after the Kushite Dynasty in Egypt ended.
