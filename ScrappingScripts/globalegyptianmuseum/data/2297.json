{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:270", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "0.6 cm", "Width": "1 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs. This example is crudely moulded and cut, and bears an indistinct motif on the underside, perhaps derived from the hieroglyph 'neb' meaning 'lord' or 'all' and commonly used to fill the space at either end of larger scarabs."}
