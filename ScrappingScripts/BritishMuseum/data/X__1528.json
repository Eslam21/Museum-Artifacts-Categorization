The hair is parted over the brow and combed backwards. It is held in place with a broad fillet. An object in the shape of a female head. The band around the head indicates that the subject is royal. The rounded facial features are typical of this particular queen's images. Ptolemaic statues usualy have a marble head fitted into a body of another material. This has also been interpreted as a representation of Aphrodite. Marble, chipped. Medium-grained white island marble (Parian ?). Broken away under the chin; all the back of the head missing. Repaired at the left cheek. Chipped at hair, brow, nose, lips and chin. Surface weatherworn. Possible faint traces of pigment on eyes and hair(?).

", " The features of the face are reminiscent of the fourth century B.C., but the softly rendered eyes seem Hellenistic. Probably the head is from a classicizing work of late Hellenistic times, possibly representing Aphrodite (Buddle & Nicholls 1967, no.79, pl. 26). The poor preservation makes it impossible to determine whether an earlier figure is being freely copied. A broadly comparable little head is in New York; see Richter (1954, 89 no. 163, pI. II6). Probably classicizing work of about late Hellenistic date. Probably classicizing work of late Hellenistic or early Imperial date. (Hogarth 1898-9, pI. 14. 8). Budde, L. and Nicholls, R. 1967.
