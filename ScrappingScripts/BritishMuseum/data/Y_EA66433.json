Petrie illustrated a number of different versions on scarabs and scaraboids (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 4-7). This scaraboid is close to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 98-99, type XXVIII, subtype A167-168, see especially A167 for this piece). Let's note that the motif on the underside is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
