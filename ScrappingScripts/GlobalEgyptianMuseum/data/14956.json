{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 8656", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "HAMMERING", "Height": "14.5 cm", "Name": "Statue of a Kneeling King", "Description": "The king is kneeling, wearing a Shendyt kilt and a Nemes headdress with a uraeus, or royal cobra. His arms are stretched before him in a prayerful manner. He was holding something, which is now missing. It could have been a naos, or shrine, of a god or simply a statue of a god. Statues of a person holding a naos had been placed in temples from the New Kingdom to the Late Period. This allowed the donor to symbolically participate in the offerings brought for the god and to receive the god's protection."}
