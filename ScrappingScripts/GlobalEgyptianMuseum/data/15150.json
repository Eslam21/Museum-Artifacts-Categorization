{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 98630-98645", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "28.1 cm", "Name": "Statuettes of Iby", "Description": "Iby was a high official during the Sixth Dynasty. He was buried at Saqqara, near the causeway of King Unas' complex. Iby's tomb was very rich in its furnishings, among which these 16 statuettes were found. These statuettes were stolen from the tomb at Saqqara but fortunately were retrieved. Thirteen are wooden standing statuettes. The other three are of limestone. Two of these depict him sitting on chairs and one shows him squatting on a base on the floor. The statuettes are unique and are of great artistic importance as they depict Iby at different ages, from childhood to old age. It might have been very difficult to show his many different ages in the features of the statuettes. The artist or artists, however, succeeded to a great extent in carving the statuettes with distinction. Fifteen of the statuettes show Iby with short hair and one depicts him with long flaring hair. Some depict him wearing short skirts and others long ones. The long skirts have trapezoid projections at the front obtained from starched linen. They are mostly decorated with various motifs. They are sometimes held in the center by Iby with his right hand. One statuette shows him with his arms crossed on his chest."}
