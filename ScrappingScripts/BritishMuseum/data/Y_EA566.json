{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA566"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Dedusobek: consisting of two parts. In the upper area are eleven columns of hieroglyphs, which contain a series of laudatory epithets of the owner of the stela. Below, Dedusobek is seated at the left in front of an offering-table piled high with bread, meat and vegetables. To the right of the table stands his wife, named Hemet. Over the food are a number of hieroglyphs; those in the centre refer to offerings in a thousand portions each of the commonest commodities in these formulaic descriptions: bread, beer, oxen, fowl, calcite vessels and measures of cloth.

This official seems in the Middle Kingdom to have been something of a policeman, perhaps even an inspector of police, and his other stela in the British Museum (.830) makes it clear that he was also a senior justice official at the Middle Kingdom capital of Itj-tawy, near modern Lisht. Although the specific find-spot of this stela is unknown, from associations with other monuments of Dedusobek, including another stela in the British Museum, one in the Louvre in Paris (C 240), and an offering table in Cairo (CG 23055) he must have had a chapel in Abydos like many of his contemporaries. It is probable that these objects were all made in the north and then later transported south to be set up in this chapel. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
