{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 68752", "Dating": "CHEOPS/KHUFU", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "1.37 cm", "Name": "Stela of Khufu", "Description": "A stela of grey granite is in the form of a piece of stone extracted from a quarry. The only polished part is decorated with hieroglyphic signs and with the name of King Khufu inscribed in the cartouche. This is considered to be one of the rare examples of a cartouche belonging to this king that has been found. Even in his Great Pyramid at Giza, only one other cartouche has been found bearing his name \"Khufu.\" The inscription on this stela is not well engraved and gives the impression that it is an unfinished work."}
