", " Cupcake-shaped weights are the most common type found in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201cdomed\u201d type), and elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 4). Very often made of basalt or bronze, other materials in this shape are also well attested, like alabaster used for this specimen (Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 13). They start to be particularly popular with the Late Period, even though they do appear with the Ramesside Period (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 26). Such type is especially associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples (Cour-Marty 1990, 20, 25, fig. 22-24). However a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; Gerritt van Alfen, P. 2002, 184, n. 654). This is probably the case of this specimen which mass corresponds more precisely to 1 shekel. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
