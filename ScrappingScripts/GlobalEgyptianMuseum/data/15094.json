{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 60678,79", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "SANDAL", "Material": "GOLD", "Technique": "HAMMERING; SOLDERED", "Name": "Pair of Golden Sandals of Tutankhamun", "Description": "The last stage of the embalming was the bandaging. Each finger and toe was individually wrapped, then each limb, and finally the whole body. Too many ointments poured on Tutankhamun's mummy caused severe damage to the tissues, except for those protected by gold: the face, fingers, and toes. In fact, gold sheaths covered the toes and finally the golden sandals were put on the feet while the lector priest recited incantations, which would permit the king to trample his enemies underfoot."}
