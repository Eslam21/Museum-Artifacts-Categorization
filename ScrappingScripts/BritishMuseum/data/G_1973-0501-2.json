{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.2"], "Description": [" Terracotta mould-made Ithyphallic Harpocrates figure with jar. A youth seated on a plain rectangular plinth. He is modelled in the round and naked, with a long side-lock on the left side of his shaved head, curving behind to hang down his back. A large phallus rises to wind round his waist, the glans resting against his left side. Resting on his right thigh, and held against his right side by both hands, is an amphora with handles placed midway on its body. Solid; probably made in a two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt; with traces of a black paint or pitch-like substance in several places. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (early, ?)

Bailey dates these to the Late Period, or early Ptolemaic period (Bailey 2008, 77, nos 3237-8). There are a number from the same mould series, including a kiln waster (British Museum GR1973,0501.2, GR1973,0501.63, GR1973,0501.64, GR1973,0501.75; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.94.1914, E.95.1914 and E.145.1914). Another mould series also carries this jar type (British Museum GR1973,0501.47, GR1973,0501.48; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.144.1914, E.147.1914) as do two other examples from Naukratis (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA597; British Museum GR 1973,0501.64). Note the Fitzwilliam E.1914 sequence were attributed to \u2018Antinoopolis?\u2019 and the British Museum GR1973,0501 sequence were found unregistered, but that both sequences include numerous terracottas now known to be found and/ or produced at Naukratis of types that predate the founding of Antinoopolis. Uprovenanced examples from Egypt have been dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC (Fischer 1994, no. 16; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.3, no.51) although Besques dates one to the Roman period (Besques 1992, pl.79, no.E401).
