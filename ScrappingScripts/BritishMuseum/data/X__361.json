This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Since Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.88.40 was discovered in Naukratis cemetery, it is possible that this specimen can be dated to the Late Dynastic-Early Ptolemaic period. However, objects predating the 4th century BC, though less numerous, have been discovered in the cemetery. A few other alabastra are known from such a context. The production of alabastra is documented in Naukratis during the Late Period, particularly between the end of the 26th and the beginning of the 27th dynasty: \u201cmany thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u201d as well as unfinished vessels in the same material were found in the temenos of Apollo in 1885, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). Alabastra vessels already appear in the late 25th dynasty (examples of the 7th century from the royal cemeteries at el-Kurru and Nuri in Sudan: Dunham 1950, 31, fig. 11c, j and pl. XXXIX; Dunham 1955, 13, fig. 3). However, they start to be really popular in the 26th dynasty and are still produced in the Roman Period (Petrie 1937, 14; Aston 1994, 166; Masson 2007, 612, pl. XXVIII no. 1-3; Masson forthcoming). Aston, B.G. 1994, Ancient Egyptian stone vessels: materials and forms. Heidelberger Orientverlag, Heidelberg. Dunham, D. 1950, The Royal cemeteries of Kush, vol.
