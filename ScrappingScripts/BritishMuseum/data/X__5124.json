", " The sherd joins Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.54d.1899. The sherd also belongs to the same vase as Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.54.a.1899, GR.54.b.1899, GR.54.c.1899 and possibly belongs to the same vase as Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.54.f.1899 and Cairo JE46338. Cook suggests that this sherd belongs to an early and experimental phase of the Clazomenian black-figure style. E.R. Price (East Greek Pottery, 1927, 22) argued that white-slip Clazomenian pottery was the link between the Clazomenian sarcophagi, which were covered in a white slip, and the later Clazomenian black-figure wares. She explained that the features (the use of white dots as well as the use of white lines together with incised lines for inner details) on the white slip sherds are paralleled both on the sarcophagi and the later vases. Cook (1952 note 64) rejected that argument on the basis of both dating and styles.
