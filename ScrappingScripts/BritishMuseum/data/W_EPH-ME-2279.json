The rather extraordinary message reads: \"Please don't write such long letters I can hardly read them they are so long & think of the cost of ink, & your valuable time\". This curt message is neither signed or personally addressed. It is followed a year later from what may be the same person (EPH-ME 2280) and sent to the same address but the recipient had since moved addresses. It is hardly surprising that the sender did not know she had changed addresses judging by what must have proved a frosty reception to the first card."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Very good condition."], "Subjects": [" gambling/gaming ", " dominoes "], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Margaret Scott"], "Associated places": [" Associated with: Cairo (city) "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Bella Bennett"], "Acquisition date": ["2014"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased 12th May 2014."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["EPH-ME.2279"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 54685 (printed postcard number) ", " Miscellaneous number: Cai 152 (printed postcard number (Cairo series)) "]}
