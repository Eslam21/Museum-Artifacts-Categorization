", " Probably locally produced at the Naukratis terracottas workshop that was operational from around the 3rd to the 2nd century BC. Parallel from Bubastis (Perdrizet 1921, pl. 13, 47) and similar to example from Chatby cemetery, Alexandria (Adriani 1956, 36, fig. 36, no. 25810), thought to be of Alexandrian production. An unprovenanced Egyptian parallel was given a late 4th century BC date by Fischer (Fischer 1994, pl.6, no.39). For the muffling and the gesture, compare a \u2018dancer\u2019 from Alexandria, dated to the beginning of the 3rd century BC (Besques 1992, pl. 75a). Parallels from Naukratis in British Museum (GR 1886,0401.1447, Bailey 2008, no. 3516), Bristol Museum (H2221) and similar fragments also in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA545).
