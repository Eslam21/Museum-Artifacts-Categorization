{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85621"], "Description": [" Modelled female clay figurine with prominent buttocks and pubic triangle, and finished lower legs which are rounded off without any shaping of the knees or feet. The buttocks project markedly out from behind, but there is relatively little attempt to shape the hips, waist or thighs. A pubic triangle is marked fairly roughly, and placed quite low down, as a group of lightly incised lines in which are four dots. A separate circular dot above marks a navel. The figure is a relatively narrow and delicate example, although not very finely made. It has been formed as two separate hand-modelled strips, joined together vertically. The join is not particularly neat and has not been smoothed, apart from where the pubic triangle has been marked. One strip is pushed into the other somewhat, and was probably thicker to begin with.
