Kinch places the sherd within his Group B; the lack of a reserved handle zone further suggests that the sherd belongs within his Group B 2.\u03b1 or .\u03b2 of Vroulian cups. It is impossible to determine to which of the two groups the cup belongs since the defining characteristic is found on the underside of the stemmed foot, which is now lost."], "Bibliographic references": [" Kinch 1914 / Vroulia (p. 182, fig. 64) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GN.11) (phase 3) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 163 note 20) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.756"]}
