The setting with rocks and trees may be compared to another sheet in the British Museum (Oo,6.59; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 173) and a painting of the 'Rest on the Flight to Egypt' of c. 1634-5 in the Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha (Roethlisberger 1961 no. 221, p. 485, II, fig. 34). It should also be recognised as a continuation of the tonal landscape studies Claude made in his Early Sketchbook (see for instance, Oo,6.19; Oo,6.22). The verso shows one sketch of a young child and three sketches for the composition on the recto. Yet while these pen and inks studies from the landscape on the recto, it is possible that they were executed contemporaneously. Claude, in these sketches, has sought to find the best position of the bridge. This positioning of the bridge recurs in a few drawings from the Liber Veritatis that record now lost paintings (see Roethlisberger 1961, I, LV 7 p.108, II, fig. 37 and LV 39 pp.169-170, II, fig. 99) Lit.: A.M.
