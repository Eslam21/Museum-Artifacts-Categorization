{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "29", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "37 cm", "Width": "10.98 cm", "Depth": "10.38 cm", "Name": "Shabti for Niuse", "Description": "This shabti is unusually large and has conspicuously long feet. The large head is fixed onto a rather flat body. The locks of the wig and the pattern of the collar are in relief. The wig and eyes still show traces of black paint. There are no tools in the hands of the figure. Below the arms is an inscription in seven lines with meticulously carved hieroglyphs. It covers only the front of the figure and stops at the calf height. The spell is short and only recounts the call for the shabti of Niuse, his tasks and the demand to fulfil these obligations."}
