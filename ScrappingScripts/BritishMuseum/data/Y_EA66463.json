Von Bissing argued also that it represented the name of Psamtek I associated with a Hes-vase, meaning the honoured one, now dead (Bissing 1951, 65-66). However, closer inspection reveals that it actually represents the name Neferibra of Psamtek II, with the nefer sign depicted horizontally. The name of Neferibra appears on other scarabs from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. 38, no. 186 and Gardner 1888, pl. 18, no. 28: scarabs respectively in stone and Egyptian blue). This scarab was assigned to a type which was distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Greece and Punic sites (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI, subtype 27-28, see especially 28 for this piece). This scarab, however, is well-related to her larger type XXVIII B. For a close parallel in style (similar treatment of legs, hieroglyphic signs): Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H3719. Bissing, F.
