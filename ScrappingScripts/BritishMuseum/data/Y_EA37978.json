{"artifact_name": "tomb-painting", "Object Type": ["tomb-painting"], "Museum number": ["EA37978"], "Description": [" Painting from the tomb chapel of Nebamen: the fragmentary top register shows workers standing in front of a gaggle of geese and presenting a basket of eggs to two seated scribes, who record the produce. In the lower register workers come with a flock of geese, and a man presents birds in baskets. A scribe stands reading out the list of produce to a large seated figure of the tomb owner, towards whom both upper registers were oriented (.37979; not displayed). The three vertical registers and one horizontal register of black painted hieroglyphic texts face the same way as the people who speak what is written. In the lower register the man bending forward and holding a stick speaks to the men squatting in front of him.
