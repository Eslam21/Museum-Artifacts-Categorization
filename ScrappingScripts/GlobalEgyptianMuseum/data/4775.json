The front contains a scarab as a symbol for the rising sun. On either side of the scarab we find Isis and Nephthys in jubilation, the wife and sister of Osiris, identifying the rising sun with Osiris, the god of resurrection. Pectorals like these, made of stone and with a cavetto cornice at the top, were placed on the chest of the mummy, doubling in function as a heart scarab. The reverse carries the spell from the Book of the Dead that warns the heart not to rise against its owner in the judgement of the dead. The owner of this pectoral was the Royal Scribe of the Library, Piai."}
