", " The exterior and interior surfaces of the sherd were burnt during the bombings in London in 1941. Although Lemos does not discuss this sherd, it ought to belong to the Group with the filling ornament (Lemos 1991, 110). The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds of the Grand Style. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. The depiction of male figures in this group is done in outline as the male figure appears here. In later Grand Style vases, male figures are depicted with coloured flesh.
