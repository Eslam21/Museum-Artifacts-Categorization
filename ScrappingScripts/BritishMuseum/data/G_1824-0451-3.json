{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1824,0451.3"], "Description": [" Bronze figure of Isis: the figure has been mounted on a new base. Her right arm with the hand holding the patera is restored. The original arm would not have been raised so high as this, but was probably outstretched. Traces of gilding survive on the goddess's face, neck and on the situla. The subject wears a chiton over which a himation is draped and secured in a knot between the breasts. This costume, the tripartite wig, vulture headdress and striding stance are all features that are influenced by earlier Egyptian-style representations of Ptolemaic queens. In her left hand she holds a situla, while the other hand may originally have held a sistrum, as seen on similar examples of the type.
