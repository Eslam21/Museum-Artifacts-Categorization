", " Oinochoai are not common Chian shapes. For parallels regarding stemmed bowl, see Lemos no. 1272 from Pitane. Lemos places this sherd in Stage 2 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless. The vases in Stage 2 have even more basic rosettes than the vases from Stage 1. However, the rosettes on this sherd are more carefully done than those on other sherds from this group, although the deterioration of the Sphinx and Lion Style appears quite clearly in the execution of the face of the different figures. For parallels regarding the sphinx, see Lemos no. 1434 from Ras el Bassit. ", " The numbers '17' and (overwritten) '18' are written in ink on the interior surface of the sherd.
