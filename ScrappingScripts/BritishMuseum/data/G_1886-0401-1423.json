The fabric is Egyptian Nile silt, though the Nile silt fabric is too generic to specifically attribute to Naukratis, it is possible this type was made there. This is not standard for Late period Egyptian figurines, but instead represents a hybrid form that appear influenced by Archaic East Greek (Stampolidis 2003, 384, no.577 Archaeological Museum of Gela inv. no. 8378, Gela Acropolis, dated 650- 640 BC) and Cypriot figures (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1424 from Naukratis; Higgins 1954, 405, pl. 208; Smith 1928, B361 limestone sculpture from Camirus), though have no close parallels from either region. Other hybrid terracottas made of Nile silt with similar facial features, but with solid heads and wearing polos and veil, have also been found at Naukratis (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1422 and GR 1886,0401.1453; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford N1886.481 and AN1896-1908-E.4661; Greenock Museum 1987.467; Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA620).
