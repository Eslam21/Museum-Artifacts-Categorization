They were commonly used in the market place for weighing goods to be bought and sold, while smaller and more accurate sets of scales were to be found in workshops and temples for weighing precious materials. These silver scale pans were probably discovered in the early twentieth century among a hoard of votive objects and other ritual furnishings from the temple of the goddess Hathor at Dendera. Each pan bears in incised hieroglyphic inscription, a ritual text naming Hathor, lady of Iunt (Heliopolis). Suspension cords would have been attached by means of small holes at the edges."], "Bibliographic references": ["Taylor 2010 / Journey through the afterlife: Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (no. 108)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 2010 4th Nov-2011 6th March, Round Reading Room BM, Book of the Dead 2012 July -September, Tokyo, Mori museum, The Book of the Dead: Journey Through the Afterlife 2012, October - November, Fukuoka Museum of Art, The Book of the Dead 2013, May - September, Perth, Western Australian Museum, The Book of the Dead 2015, 19th June - 5th Sept.
