The central scene shows the tomb owner striding towards the right, dressed in a festive garment with a panther skin. He is holding the staff of his office and a sceptre in his hands. His wife stands behind him with her left arm around his shoulders. She is wearing a long tight-fitting dress and a long wig. The couple's daughter, Nedjet-pet, is represented in front of them on a much smaller scale, placing her hand on her breast in a respectful greeting. In the lower scene, two offering bearers are depicted bringing geese, a jug of milk, and a basket full of bread. The two men wear a lotus flower as a necklace around their necks. A scribe with an incense burner in his hands stands opposite them."}
