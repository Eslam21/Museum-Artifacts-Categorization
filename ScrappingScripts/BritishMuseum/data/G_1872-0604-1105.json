{"artifact_name": "ear-ring", "Object Type": ["ear-ring"], "Museum number": ["1872,0604.1105"], "Description": [" Pair of gold ear-rings in the form of lynx heads and amphoras: the lynx head was made in two halves. Thin sheet gold would have been pressed over two bronze formers, the front and back pieces, and then the finer details added by chasing. Behind the collar there is a small garnet bead, while the hoop consists of a thin wire with additional wires twisted around it. The amphora pendant is elaborately decorated with granulation, a garnet for the body and a green glass bead at the bottom. Another pendant would originally have hung from the suspension hoop at the bottom, but is now missing on both earrings. A plaited wire chain hangs from the ring.

This particular pair has no known provenance, but other examples of the type have been found in Syria and the eastern Mediterranean. The use of wild and exotic animals was common on hoop earrings of the mid- to later Hellenistic period. Bibliography: J. Ogden, 'Ancient Jewellery' (London, 1992), 45, fig. 28; M.
