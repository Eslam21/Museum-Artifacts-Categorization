The goddess of love is dressed in a wig whose curls fall on the shoulders and which is surmounted by a diadem. The head carries two large crowns of different aspects. Her upper body is encircled by a tiara of flowers, symbol of fertility. On her chest, one notices a necklace equipped with an object which seems to be a horn of abundance. The nudity and the accentuation of the feminine form proves that the figurines should be understood in a fertility context in real life or in the Afterlife."}
