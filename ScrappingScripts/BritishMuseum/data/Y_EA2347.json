{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2347"], "Description": [" Head from a limestone male figure, the body and base now missing. The figure wears a short styled wig with individual tresses of the hair delineated from the centre of the head. His head is raised, creating the suggestion of an upward gaze. Black paint has been applied across the wig while red-brown paint has been used to denote his skin. His eyes are wide with slim lines of black paint around the eyelids, and the eyebrows are faint but slightly arched. The nose is slim and the mouth is small in size with the outer corners visibly upturned. On the reverse are the remains of the top of what was likely a back-pillar or seat, which also has traces of white paint. There are small chips around the neck area and on both sides of the face, and on the reverse of the wig. The figure is attached to a small modern base.

The surviving outline of the stone across the reverse is difficult to identify as either a back-pillar or part of a tall seat, and too little of this section survives to confirm whether any text may once have been inscribed on the surface."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["incomplete - head only"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA2347"], "Registration number": [".2347"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.2347 (Birch Slip Number) "]}
