{"artifact_name": "pectoral; heart-scarab", "Object Type": [" pectoral ", " heart-scarab "], "Museum number": ["EA7865"], "Description": [" Glazed composition pectoral: this pectoral or chest ornament is pylon shaped, initiating the towers flanking the monumental gateway entrance into an Egyptian temple. Like a pylon it has sloping sides and a curved cavetto cornice along the top which represents, the blending fronds found at the top of a wall made from the vertical reed stalks daubed with mud. Around the other three edges is block decoration. The basic colour is yellow, inlaid with blue, red and green glazes, which imitate respectively gold, lapis lazuli, cornelian and turquoise. A dark blue glazed composition heart scarab, an obvious substitute for lapis lazuli, is inset into a hole cut exactly to receive it so that the insect's back is visible on the pectoral's upper face. It is depicted resting in a solar barque which sails on the celestial ocean and is flanked by figures of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, the hieroglyphs for their names on their heads, their arms raised in adoration. The text names then respectively \"Lady of the West\" and \"Mistress of the Necropolis\". A 'djed' pillar, Girdle of Isis amulet and two wedjat eyes provide protection. All are inlaid with polychrome glazes. On the reverse of the pectoral the text of the heart scarab is visible inlaid in turquoise green hieroglyphs. It is Chapter 30B of the 'Book of the Dead'. The deceased is named as the Lady Ptahemheb. The remainder of the pectoral's underside has a pattern of parallel lines in dark blue glaze which cross to form a square frame to the scarab. Six holes for stitching to the mummy wrappings run from behind the cavetto cornice to emerge along the top of the rim.

Ideally make from a quartz sand core covered by a vitreous alkaline glaze, glazed composition was a particularly popular material with the Egyptian jewellery maker because of its malleability and its ability to imitate the colors of other materials. The motif of a heart scarab flanked by the figures of Isis and Nephthys is first found in pectorals from the burial of Tutankhamun.
