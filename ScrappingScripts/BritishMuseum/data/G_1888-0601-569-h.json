If the sherd does belong to a similar cup, then the sherd belongs in Group B 1.\u03b1 or Group B 1.\u03b2. It is impossible to determine to which of the two groups the cup belongs since the defining characteristic is found on the underside of the stemmed foot, which is now lost. According to Schlotzhauer, Vrulian cups with a geometric pattern in the handle zone and with a shape similar to South Ionian cups with everted rims (Schlotzhauer Type 8, which coincides with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian cup type A1 and Hayes' Ionian cup type III) may be contemporary and ought to be dated amongst the earliest examples of Vroulia pottery at Naukratis.
