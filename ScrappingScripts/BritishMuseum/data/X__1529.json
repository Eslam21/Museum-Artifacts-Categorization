", " A few amulets in similar material were found in Naukratis, all representing Egyptian gods. They share details in the manufacture and style: Montreal, Redpath Museum 2507; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.86.326 and 86.188; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.684 and AN1888.173; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2267. It is plausible that they were produced locally. Pataikos might be related with the god Ptah as a craftman god (Andrews 1994, 39). He is definitely linked with the other dwarf god Bes, with whom he appears often on the same amulet or in the same context (on the relationship between these two gods: Bult\u00e9 1998, 379 and 382). As an amulet, Pataikos seems to appear as early as the 6th dynasty, although amulets of the dwarf god are better identified from the New Kingdom onwards (Andrews 1994, 39). His amulets are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (as illustrated in Mendes: Wilson 1982, 32, pl. XXIX n\u00b03-4) and as popular as Bes in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming).
