The sherd possibly belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.569.e, 1888,0601.569.k, 1888,0601.569.l, 1888,0601.569.p and 1888,0601.569.r. A drill hole on the bottom of the sherd indicates that a sample from the vessel was used for NAA purposes. According to Weber, this particular sample was used as comperanda for a study on other vessels. If the sherd belongs to the same cups as British Museum 1888,0601.569.e, then this sherd belongs in Kinch's Group B 1.\u03b1 or .\u03b2 of Vroulia cups. It is impossible to determine to which of the two groups the cup belongs since the defining characteristic is found on the underside of the stemmed foot, which is now lost. Schlotzhauer comments that 1888,0601.569.e ought to be placed amongst the earliest Vroulia examples at Naukratis because of the geometric pattern in the handle zone and because the shape of the cup shares similarities with his South Ionian cup Type 8, which coincides with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian cup type A1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88) and Hayes' Ionian cup type III (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). ", " The fragment (sample no. Nau 59) was analysed by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, with NAA. Originally a 'chemical single' (Mommsen et al. 2006,73; Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006, 56), the piece now joins other samples in a chemical group (Ul65) which can be attributed to Rhodes as a production place since it includes a Hellenistic stamped Rhodian amphora (British Museum 2011,5002.164). The analyses are still unpublished.
