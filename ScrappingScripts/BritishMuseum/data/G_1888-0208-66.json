By the same hand as T\u00fcbingen 2656 (C. Watzinger, Griechische Vasen in T\u00fcbingen, pl. 2 - an inaccurate drawing). The T\u00fcbingen amphora has a steeper shoulder and rounder belly, but is generally similar. Ours should be completed by analogy with a high, slightly spreading neck, shoulder handles without plastic heads (parts of springings of both handles remain), and a spreading foot.
