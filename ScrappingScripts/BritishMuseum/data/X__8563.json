According to its description, it looks very similar to another amulet of Harpokrates which is said to come from Naukratis: Paris, Louvre Museum E20829. The child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). His cult was particularly developed in the Delta during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (Sandri 2006).
