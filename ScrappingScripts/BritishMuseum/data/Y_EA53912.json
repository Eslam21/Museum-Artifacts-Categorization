{"artifact_name": "textile; sock", "Object Type": [" textile ", " sock "], "Museum number": ["EA53912"], "Description": [" Sock for right foot with separation between the big toe and four other toes worked in brown wool yarn (several S-spun strands, Z-plied) in a single needle looping technique sometimes called naalebinding and worked from the toe upwards. Each toe is made separately, then the two are joined and the rows of loops worked round the whole foot 45 times. The back of the sole is then worked (this is no longer preserved). The heel section, which is formed by rows of loops being worked backwards and forwards, is joined by a welt across the instep. Another welt marks the start of the ankle section worked in the round for four rows and then backwards and forwards for another 11 rows to create a centre front opening. The back of the heel and part of the sole are not preserved. The impression of the sandal thong remains visible.
