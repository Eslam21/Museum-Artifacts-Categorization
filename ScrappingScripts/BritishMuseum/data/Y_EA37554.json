{"artifact_name": "model", "Object Type": ["model"], "Museum number": ["EA37554"], "Description": [" The forepart of a horse with an armed rider: St Menas as a military saint. The body and head of the horse were made in a two-piece mould and are hollow; the legs were added. The rider also was applied, using shaped strips of clay, but only the feet, legs and buttocks, his right hand, and a small part of his body survive. The feet are shown in a curious arched manner. A circular shield is luted onto the left side of the horse's neck. The legs of the horse have lost their extremities. Buff marl ware containing a few grains of sand, probably Abu Mena Buff Ware. There is brown paint detailing the horse's eyes and mane, and also some on the head; the same paint is used to depict the breastband and ornaments below it, with details in white paint; there is red paint on one ear. The rider has a red body, white legs and brown feet (boots?). The shield has a brown-painted edge, a circle of roundels and a central element also in brown. This central element has red paint additions, and white paint is used on the rest of the shield\u2019s ornament.
