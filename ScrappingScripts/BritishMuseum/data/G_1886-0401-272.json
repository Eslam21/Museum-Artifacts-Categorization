These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type A2 or B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. The number in Petrie's catalogue, 217, is written in ink on the exterior surface of the sherd. ", " The sherd belongs epigraphically with 1886,0401.263, 264 and 266, and is accordingly dated here.
