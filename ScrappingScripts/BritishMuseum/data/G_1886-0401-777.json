Schlotzhauer identifies this sherd as imitating the Type 10.1/2.A South Ionian cup with everted rim. Type 10 cups were mass produced and include numerous variants. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type V (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Numerous Type 10 South Ionian cups have been found at Naukratis, as well as in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra at Megara Hyblaea on Sicily, and at Berezan on the Black Sea (Posamentir 2006, 165). To date, such examples are note common. The cup may have been produced by Greeks at Naukratis. The Greek inscription shows that it was used by a Greek and so others were probably specifically made for Greeks trading or living at Naukratis."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (p. 717, no. 758) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 52, no. 322, NAU 146, pl.32c-e) ", " Schlotzhauer & Villing 2006 / East Greek Pottery from Naukratis: The Current State of Research (p. 68 note 108) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (IA.22) (phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.777"]}
