{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA65429"], "Description": [" Fragmentary green schist figure of king Mentuhotep VI, the lower legs and base now missing. The king wears the nemes headcloth, with wide striped lappets that extend over the shoulders and a twisted braid at the back. The material is tucked behind the ears, and a faint horizontal band across the forehead. Above this is the coiled body of the uraeus cobra, its head now lost. His eyes are narrow and slanted. The nose is almost as broad as the mouth, which features thin lips and is sharply incised around the lower lip. His face is particularly rounded at the jawline, with a clear bulge of flesh around the neck. His upper body is bare, and has a subtly modelled torso and chest. Both broad arms are held at either side of the body, with an uncertain object held in the left hand and a piece of folded cloth held in the right hand. He wears a belted shendyt kilt, and his left leg clearly strides out in advance of the right leg. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar with a single column of incised text, the lower portion of the pillar and inscription now missing. In addition to the break at the lower legs, there are some small chips to the stone surface around the edges of the wig and kilt, and some further damage to the edges of the back-pillar.
