A large tress falls behind the head, while two wavy tresses are pulled to the front and wrapped in narrow bands, which end over the breasts in two spirals that encircle disks. A cobra is depicted on the forehead for protection. The queen has a large face and enormous, almost detached, ears. Her oversized limbs portray a powerful stature. She is wearing a robe with a very low opening and large anklets that ornament her thick ankles. She wears an incised openwork pectoral, a large piece of jewelry that is worn upon the chest. The erased text on the throne's sides likely listed the queen's titles."}
