This scarab is close to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B13-14, especially B13 for this piece). Let's note that the motif on the underside is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII. Petrie illustrated variants of this association of an animal - often a falcon or a mythical creature - with a debased hieroglyphic inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 71-78). The hieroglyphs, as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93), in this case maybe Wahibra. Since the Scarab Factory was mainly in activity between 600 and 570 BC (see Webb forthcoming), Wahibre would rather refer to Apries.
