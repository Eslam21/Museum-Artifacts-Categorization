{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA71020"], "Description": [" Fragmentary granite figure of a king, now headless and with much of the body and base now missing. The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth, with long lappets which extend down onto the chest. The chest is bare, with broad arms and a notable narrowing at the waist. There is a slight indication of a bend at the left arm, which may indicate that this was a seated statue. Much of the reverse has been damaged and little now remains, however based on the width of the stone intact at the back of the king\u2019s figure it is likely that there was a high backed chair or a back-pillar on the reverse. In addition to the loss of the lower body from the torso and the loss of the king\u2019s head, there are numerous chips across the statue surface. There are also further cracks at the neck area in between the nemes lappets.
