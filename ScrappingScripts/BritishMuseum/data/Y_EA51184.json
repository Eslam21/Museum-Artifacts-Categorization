{"artifact_name": "adze", "Object Type": ["adze"], "Museum number": ["EA51184"], "Description": [" A heavy copper adze-blade: with straight sides, decreasing in width from the cutting edge to the butt. The surface of the metal, although cleaned, is extensively pitted by corrosion, and several fragments at each end of the tool have been repaired. Probably the butt was of the square type, although it is difficult to be sure because of the damaged state of this part of the blade. The cutting edge is very blunt, since it seems to have only been hammered but never ground.
