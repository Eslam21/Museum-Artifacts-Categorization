", " Petrie notes the find of the dogs in his Journal (Petrie 1884-5, p. 85) \"I have bought two dogs (bases broken in two) seated 21 in[ches]s high, found by the Great North wall some time ago; I gave 8/-[shillings] for the pair to the Shekh. They are poor work, but curious.\" The Great North wall must be the northern part of the Great Temenos, the enclosure wall of the Egyptian sanctuary of Amun-Ra. Griffith, too, refers to the dogs, linking them with the cult of Apollo (Petrie 1884-5, p. 189, entry for 10th April 1885): \"[...] and we have fragments of several large limestone dogs, similar to one in basalt at the Bulaq Museum with a dedication to [Greek inscription: Apolloni lukeio]. The latter must have come from some essentially Greek town in Egypt & therefore probably from Naucratis\". The statue in Bulaq he refers to is a Ptolemaic black granite sculpture of a jackal from Luxor, dated to c. 200BC, in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (CG 9276). It suggests that the Egyptian god Anubis was equated by Greeks with Apollo in his guise as the 'wolf god' Apollo Lykeios.
