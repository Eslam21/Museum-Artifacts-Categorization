{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA18531"], "Description": [" White steatite scarab of the 'an-ra' type, pierced lengthwise, with pronotum and elytra divided by a T-shaped trace formed with carved double lines; the wing-cases are bordered by a line and marked by V-shaped humeral callosities; the forelegs are notched and protrude from the body; rings reinforce the threading holes. The base is decorated with engraved inscriptions consisting of two opposed open-ended vertical ovals or pseudo-cartouches surrounding 'an-ra'-type sequences of four and five signs (\u201b, n, r, and possibly t), flanked on each side by addorsed uraei (one missing). two supplementary signs r are carved above the heads of the uraei.

However, the protruding notched legs, the double lines on the back, the marked humeral callosities, the threading holes reinforced by rings could also indicate a New Kingdom dating, possibly Ramesside, according to the comment about a similar item by Fr.
