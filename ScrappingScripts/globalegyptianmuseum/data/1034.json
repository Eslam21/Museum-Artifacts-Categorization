{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6369", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "FIGURED OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN; DRAWING", "Height": "5.6 cm", "Depth": "1.1 cm", "Name": "Shepherd foxes", "Description": "This piece of limestone is a beautiful example of parody. The foxes which  follow their gaggle of geese with a dignified and solemn air are wearing white robes. Their muzzles are painted in  blue-grey. The birds are all coloured yellow or orange-brown, except the all black little runt in the middle of the  gaggle, who seems to have been added at a later date."}
