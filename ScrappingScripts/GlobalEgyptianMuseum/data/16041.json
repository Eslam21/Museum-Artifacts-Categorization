He is clothed in a long robe with a head covering that is wrapped round his neck at the front. Over his head is a circular ornament. On each side of the panel there are plant decorations. These have been erased on large parts of the panel. The lower part has no decoration at all. Most of these funerary panels have been found in Alexandria or brought from the monasteries West of Alexandria or from various places in Upper and Lower Egypt, especially from Aswan, Ashmunein, and Akhmim. Most are carved from limestone; only a few are from marble. They were used to close the entrances to tombs. They are covered with loculi, that is, inscriptions, with the name of the deceased and the name of the deceased's parents, country, and the date of death. Occasionally the profession is added. The inscription is in Coptic with some Christian symbols."}
