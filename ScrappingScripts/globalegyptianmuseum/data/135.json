{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.0581", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "MINIATURE COFFIN", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED", "Height": "12.5 cm", "Width": "10.5 cm", "Name": "Miniature sarcophagus", "Description": "The small rectangular sarcophagus was probably meant to be a funerary figurine since the internal faces, entirely bare, follow the form of a human body. A hieroglyphic inscription which extends over  the entire length of a central band constitutes the only decoration of the rounded lid, of which the four corners are protruding. It mentions that the deceased was called Saese and that he was \"scribe of the king\" and \"scribe of the new recruits\". There is no doubt that this object is a faithful reproduction, in miniature, of the great stone sarcophagus in which the deceased was burried."}
