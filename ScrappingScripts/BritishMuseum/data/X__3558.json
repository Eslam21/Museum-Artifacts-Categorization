", " Venit notes: 'Lydos, or a member of his circle. Compare, for example, Berlin 1685 by Lydos (ABV 109, 24; Tiverios pl. 46a). The face of the horseman, with its simplified eye and high eyebrow, is very close to male faces drawn by the Camel Painter (for example, on the overlap Siana cup, Taranto IG 4492 [Tiverios pl. 38c, attributed by Tiverios]); the incised lines on the upper arm and thigh of the youth are paralleled on figures on both sides of the psykter-amphora in London by Lydos (London B 148 [ABV 109, 29; Tiverios pl. 52a-b]). The breastband on the mount is seen on an amphora by Lydos, Naples 2770 (ABV 109, 23; Tiverios pl. 56a), where, however, the breastband is red.'
