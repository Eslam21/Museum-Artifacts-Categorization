{"artifact_name": "ornament", "Object Type": ["ornament"], "Museum number": ["EA29096"], "Description": [" Mosaic glass border: a vertical border composed of four separate elements, two mosaic glass and two monochrome. On an opaque red field are lotus flowers in profile in opaque white with the sepals in dark blue. The scale is very small. To the left is another mosaic register composed of sections of varying lengths. The uppermost has a dark-blue field with opaque white circles, a design found in the earliest dated mosaic glass, a reminder of the difficulty of dating undocumented examples. There follows a section with egg-shaped units, half white, half red on a dark-blue field. Then a duplicate of the first unit but each circle having two pendent strokes. Framing both sides are two opaque monochrome white rods, rectangular in section.
