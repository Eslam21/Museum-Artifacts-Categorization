{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.8"], "Description": [" Terracotta seated female figure with puppy. The upper part of a devotee of Isis, seated with a puppy, perhaps representing a Sothic Dog, in her lap. She wears a tunic, and a mantle knotted between her breasts, and her hair is smooth and parted in the centre and drawn back to a large and elaborate bun at her neck; she also has large drop earrings. Her right hand is raised to the side of her head, holding a lock of hair away from it; her left hand rests on the back of the puppy. The seat, perhaps a basket-chair, has a smoothly rounded back and sloping and curving arms; a moulding crosses the back at seat level. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with traces of an overall white dressing.
