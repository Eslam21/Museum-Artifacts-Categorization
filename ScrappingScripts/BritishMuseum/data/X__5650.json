", " In the register of the Museum, considered to be a faience pendant of a sistrum. However, it looks more like a bunch of grapes. Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming a). This pendant might come from such a context. Pendants in the shape of a bunch of grapes were very common in the New Kingdom though they were still produced later (Herrmann et al. 2010, 136; Persian period example: Herrmann 2006, 237, no. 478, pl. CIII; mould to produce bunch of grapes in glazed composition from the Ptolemaic quarter in Karnak: Masson forthcoming b). They are linked with ideas of regeneration and kingship (Friedman 1998).
