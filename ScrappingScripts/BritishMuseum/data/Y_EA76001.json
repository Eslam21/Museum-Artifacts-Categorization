Plain selvedge on one side showing wear. Opposite edge and one end torn. Other end cut. Extensive wear near corner of this end with torn long side. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.24 ends per 10mm and weft c.8 picks per 10mm. There are possibly traces of sewing along the selvedge. The extent of the wear suggests a garment before it was torn up and used as mummy bandages.
