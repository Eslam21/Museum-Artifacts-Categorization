", " Rings and bracelets with terminals of snakes or serpentine deities (usually Isis and Serapis) appear across the Mediterranean throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but are most common in Egypt (Marshall 1907, nos 241-2, 244-5). These two silver pieces probably come from one bracelet. The fact that these pieces are not broken terminals suggests that they were originally attached with wire to a larger composition, possibly with another figure (or figures) such as Harpocrates (British Museum 1839,0921.1090). Serpentine Isis and Serapis representations are common on 1st and 2nd century AD limestone (and marble) relief blocks (from Naukratis [Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, AN1888.257]; British Museum, 2005,0919.1; Walker and Higgs 2000, 61\u201362, fig.49; 2001, 124\u2013125, 151), Thonis-Herakleion (Goddio 2008, 278, 296, no. 30) and Egypt (British Museum, EA1539), terracottas (British Museum, 1987,0402.29, EA37495, EA37489, EA24378, EA50135 (Bailey 2008, 27\u201328 nos 3017\u20133022) and amphora stoppers (Thomas 2011).
