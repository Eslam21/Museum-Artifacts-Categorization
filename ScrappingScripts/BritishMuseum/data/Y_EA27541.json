It is now clear that they form a coherent group of important figurines, probably produced locally already in the Late Period and into Roman times. Many examples from Naukratis are made in limestone and terracotta, with a few specimens in faience, such as this one. When made out of faience and of small size, they could be worn as an amulet (see better preserved examples published in Herrmann et al. 2010, 67, type 32, esp, no. 3-4). Similar figures in faience from Memphis: Petrie Museum UC38478 and UC38479. For a similar type in limestone from Naukratis, see for example: Durham, Oriental Museum, Durham University N.2159; BM 2011,5011.1.
