Lemos describes the sherd as belonging to the Group of Light-Walled Naukratis Animal Chalices. All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices; the decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 93). However, given the thickness of this particular sherd, it is probable that it came from a heavy chalice"], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
