She also illustrates a similar item said to be from the Karpas peninsular, though was less certain that the individual held a writing tablet. In fact, the Egyptianising kilt and pose of the right arm against the chest - the hand is missing - suggest that this is an example of the well-known variety of male votary in Egyptian dress (see Faegersten 2003).
