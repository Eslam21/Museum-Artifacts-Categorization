Six wavy lines encircle the shoulder just below the neck. Hanging down from them on opposite sides of the body are two semi-circular arrangements of wavy lines, called \u2018festoons\u2019. Between the festoons, two pairs of wavy lines run down the pot, crossing each other and arching below the festoons. In the space above the crossing of the lines on each side is a figure of an antelope, identified as an addax based on the twisted horns. Both face left and have slender bodies, bandy legs and short upturned tails. A bush motif and a series of vertical s-motifs complete the decoration. Published: G.
