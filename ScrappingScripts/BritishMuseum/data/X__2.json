", " Described as a fragment of a cake stamp or mould, however it is a fragment of plaster seal from an amphora stopper. Plaster stoppers of this type (sealed with pine pitch and with a fermentation hole and straw valve), were commonly used on wine-amphorae (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1) . This method of sealing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, type 1).
