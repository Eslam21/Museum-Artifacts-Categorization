{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1391"], "Description": [" White limestone female figure, painted. Upper half of woman, broken at the hip, standing with the right arm hanging at the side broken away below the elbow. The figure is slim, the body columnar, the head is rejoined. The left hand is holding a lotus flower between the breasts. The hair is voluminous and sharply set against the face, falling down the back behind the large ears. The lower half of the face is slightly protruding; overall the head is very deep. The earrings and neckline were indicated in vermilion paint; traces of red paint remain on the left wrist, black traces on the hair. The entire surface is heavily worn. The back is flat.

Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
