A woman, almost naked, possibly pregnant, in a seated pose as though perched on a birthingstool, her legs widely spaced, which emphasizes her vulva. Her hands rest on her thighs. A narrow himation presumably passes across her back, over her shoulders, and apparently down between her arms and body to pass over the wrists and fall by the sides of her lower legs: the modeller seems to have misunderstood aspects of this drapery. Her hair is parted in the middle and falls in waves on each side; she wears a narrow, tightly woven wreath, and her ears are pierced from front to back (but the hole does not go quite through). A rather thicker wreath hangs round her neck, and she has armlets, bracelets and anklets. The back is almost plain, only the buttocks being accentuated; a suspension-lug is placed at the nape of the neck. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt, covered, except for the lower back and buttocks, with a white dressing. Much post-firing colour remains: the flesh is pink and the hair black; black paint is used also on the eyes and eyebrows, and to outline the wreath round her neck; her drapery is painted green, and red is used on the armlets and the vulva; both wreaths appear to have been left white.
