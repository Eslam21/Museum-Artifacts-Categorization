It is a spoon, made of ivory, in the shape of a fish. One of the two faces of the spoon has the exact appearance of Tilapia nilotica, the Bolti fish of the Nile, with its fins and scales. This type of fish is often associated with the sun and the belief of ancient Egyptians in solar rebirth. The other face was partly hollowed to serve as a spoon or a palette. Objects of this type, which were used for cosmetics, were placed in tombs to serve the deceased in the afterlife. This particularly unique spoon had been shaped by an artist of great talent."}
