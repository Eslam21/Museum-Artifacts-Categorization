Lemos describes 1924,1201.264 as belonging to the Group of Light-Walled Naukratis Mature Animal Style. All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 981). Given the similarities between both sherds, 1924,1201.580 can be added to this group."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
