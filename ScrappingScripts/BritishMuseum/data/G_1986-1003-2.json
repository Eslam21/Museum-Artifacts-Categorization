{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1003.2"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Eros. Eros at a glass-furnace. Eros is naked and stands frontally, his right wing extended, the left possibly shown in a perfunctory way to the left of his head. He stands beside and partially in front of a tall tapering structure, perhaps built of bricks, as horizontal grooves may indicate. The structure has two arched openings, the lower one for serving the firingchamber, the upper one the pot-chamber where the glass was melted. Eros holds in his right hand a bowl or crucible, and, vertically in his left hand, a glass-working iron, a pontil or possible a blowing iron. The group is set on a plain flat-fronted plinth. The back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous dark-brown Nile silt.
