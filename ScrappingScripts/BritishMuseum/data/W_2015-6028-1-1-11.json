I attended ceremonies and rituals that punctuate life, and I visited a number of pilgrimages. I went as close as possible to their daily life. Coptic identity is a heritage that is over a millennium old and it is tied to Egypt. The Coptic calendar for example, is a heritage directly descended from the Pharaonic calendar, created from the rhythm of the Nile, of agriculture and of the seasons. To be Copt today is above all a question of faith but also of identity.\u201d Series exhibited: \u201cVisages d\u2019\u00c9gypte\u201d, Mus\u00e9e de Cahors Henri-Martin, France (2009) \u201cLe Porte del Mediterraneo\u201d, Palazzo Piozzo, Rivoli (2008) \u201c19 Miradas\u201d, Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor\u00e0neo, Seville (2006) \u201cRegards des photographes arabes contemporains\u201d, Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris (2005) \u201cNazar: Images from the Arab World\u201d, Fotofest, Houston, the Aperture Gallery, New York and Noorderlicht, Leeuwarden, the Netherlands (2004-2005)"], "Bibliographic references": ["Boutros and Cannuyer 2007 / Coptes du Nil: entre les Pharaons et l'Islam ces Chr\u00e9tiens d'Egypte aujourd'hui"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 2022 16 Feb \u2013 29 May, Seville, Caixa Forum, \u201cHuman Image\u201d 2021 - 2022 27 Apr \u2013 16 Jan, Madrid, Caixa Forum, \u201cHuman Image\u201d "], "Subjects": [" ceremony/ritual ", " christianity ", " cleric ", " monastery/convent ", " pilgrim "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Rose Issa"], "Acquisition date": ["2015"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["2015,6028.1.1-11"]}
