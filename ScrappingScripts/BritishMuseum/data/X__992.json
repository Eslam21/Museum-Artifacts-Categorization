", " A parallel from Mons Claudianus with the same decoration and form, but with a flared rim, was found in a deposit dated to the Trajanic period (Knowles 2006, Type, no.152). Similar forms have also been found in 1st to 2nd century AD Quseir (Whitcomb 1979, fig. 35h; Peacock 2011, with a shorter nozzle nos 63 and 64). Similar lamps in either decoration or form are in the British Museum and have been dated to the late 1st century BC (Bailey 1975, for decoration see Q584, form see Q601).
