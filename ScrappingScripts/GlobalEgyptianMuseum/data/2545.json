{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1912:287", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "EL-MINIYA WAL SHURAFA ?", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "GLASS; CARNELIAN; FAIENCE", "Technique": "GLASS-TECHNIQUE; PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; CARVED; POLISHED", "Name": "Amulets and beads", "Description": "Assortment of beads and amulets of more than one period. Most, including the glass eye-bead, seem to date to the Roman Period, after 30 BC, and this agrees with the provenance recorded for the string, Shurafa, a fortified legionary site south of Cairo. However, the glazed udjat-eye is an ancient Egyptian symbol of health, not found in this classic form so late. It is not possible without archaeological documentation to determine whether it was included in the group in ancient times, or only after modern excavation."}
