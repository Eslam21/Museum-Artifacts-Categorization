{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 28932", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING", "Width": "38.5 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of Horus and Other Various Sketches", "Description": "This finished drawing shows a large image of Horus in the form of a falcon, wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt and facing right. Above and behind the falcon are three apparently unrelated faint drawings. To the left of the falcon's head is a portrait of the head of a monarch wearing a royal headdress with uraei, or royal cobras, and a long beard with some correction. The shape of the face and the nose suggest that it could be a portrait of a Ramesside king. Further right is an incomplete drawing of the goddess Meretseger with a snake's head, crowned with the sun disk between two cow horns, standing and facing right. Behind the body of the falcon is the figure of a mouse, dressed in a fine pleated kilt as a human noble and holding a staff. Below, there are a few hieroglyphic signs from what was possibly a long script. Only a few lines can be read with clarity, for example, \"His brother,\" \"the Place of Truth\" or \"Deir el-Medina,\" and \"the west.\""}
