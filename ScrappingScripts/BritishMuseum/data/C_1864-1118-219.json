Her production of substantial issues at the mint of Alexandria was in some sense a return to the status quo of a century earlier, after the decline of production there in the interim. A complete innovation on her bronze coinage was the appearance of denominational marks. The larger value coins were marked with a Greek letter Pi (\u03a0), the symbol for the number eighty. The lower value coin was marked with a Mu (M), the number forty. An ancient metrological treatise records a table of weight-standards established by Cleopatra, and the evidence of this bronze coinage certainly points towards a reform of the bronze weights in use in Egypt during her reign. Since the third century BC constant inflation within Egypt seems to have caused a dislocation between the metal value of bronze used in Ptolemaic coinage and its actual value in monetary transactions. The resulting instability may account for the cessation of production of bronze coinage in Alexandria in the late second and early first centuries. Cleopatra's reform seems to have sought to make explicit for the first time the fiduciary nature of bronze coinage: it took its value not from its weight, but rather from the value she gave it and with which she marked it. This bold step, together with the debasement of the silver, indicates a clear policy of interven-tionism in the monetary economy on the part of the Ptolemaic administration during Cleopatra's reign. Whereas the policy under previous kings had, by and large, been to maintain the monetary system they had found in place, Cleopatra's treatment of both bronze and silver issues is indicative of a desire to innovate and adapt to new circumstances."], "Bibliographic references": [" Svoronos 1904 / \u03a4\u03b1 \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd (The Coins of the Ptolemaic Kings) (1872) ", " BMC Greek (Ptolemies) / Catalogue of Greek coins: the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt (p123.9) ", " Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth (183) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Cleopatra the Great"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: George Eastwood"], "Acquisition date": ["1864"], "Department": ["Coins and Medals"], "Registration number": ["1864,1118.219"], "C&M catalogue number": [" GC7 (BMC Greek (Ptolemies)) (123) (9) "]}
