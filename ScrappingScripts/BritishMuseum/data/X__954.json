", " According to Jaeger, the motif of the underside is unique (Jaeger 1982, 89, \u00a7 386). A relatively similar composition, with a hes vase replacing the Menkheperra cartouche, is provided by a scarab found in Naukratis in 1899 by Hogarth (Cairo, Egyptian Museum CG37369) and another one in Ibiza (the latter discussed in Gorton 1996, Type V, nos 2 and 5). Gorton consider this scarab to be either a genuine Hyksos-style scarab or a late imitation of this style (Gorton 1996, 18). A Hyksos date is too early, though early scarabs were discovered in Naukratis (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). A 26th dynasty date is more probable.
