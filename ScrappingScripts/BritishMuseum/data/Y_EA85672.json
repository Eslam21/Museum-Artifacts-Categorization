{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA85672"], "Description": [" Three joining pieces of an ostracon (BM 51, 53, 54) from a pottery vessel, that where still adjoined when excavated as the object card shows. Four lines of hieratic, written in black ink. The surface of the sherds is covered in dark brown stains of mould and therefore the text is not legible very well. The vessel was made of Nile clay pottery, closed shape, wheel made. Insight remains of a brownish-yellowish substance. On the outside salt incrustations. The sherds are part of the base of the vessel and therefore the text might have been a jar label.
