{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA37499"], "Description": [" Lentoid flask with two vertical handles: the body is opaque amethyst glass with glossy surface. On the rim is a prefabricated white and amethyst cord. The body decorations are in white, yellow, and turquoise-blue and are of fine quality. The handles were overlaid with five white and yellow threads. One handle is lost, two gaps in the body. On one side at the shoulder there is a small patch indicating misfiring - a rare detail in Egyptian vessels. A small section at the base of the handle is concave. Within the vessel is a small packet of amethyst glass fragments presumably found with the flask. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (?) ", " 19th Dynasty (?)
