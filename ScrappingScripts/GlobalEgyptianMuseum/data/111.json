On her lion's head she wears a tripartite wig    surmounted by a solar disk and a uraeus. Dressed in a tunic which falls to her ankles, she is seated on a chair  of which the back shows two superimposed scenes. Below, the Horus falcon is seated on a thicket of papyrus. This scene symbolises an episode of the famous myth of the marsh of Chemmis, where Wadjet nourished the infant Horus. Above, the kneeling goddess extends her wings in a sign of protection. The two sides of the chair are decorated with plumage motifs."}
