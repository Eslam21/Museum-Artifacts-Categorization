{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-palette", "Object Type": ["cosmetic-palette"], "Museum number": ["EA20792"], "Title": ["Object: The Hunters' Palette"], "Description": [" Fragment of 'The Hunters' Palette': of grey mudstone, decorated on one side only with scenes in low relief. Companies of warriors are shown hunting wild animals, particularly lions. Three men carry the standards denoting different tribes or provinces; the remainder carry their weapons, which include the bow, spear, mace, throwstick and lariat. The rounded objects carried by some of the warriors have been interpreted as bags or shields. One member of the company is attempting to hold a rope which has caught a hartebeest by the horns. Two lions have been hit by arrows and one of the wounded beasts is shown pursuing a man. The arrows are clearly of the flint-tipped variety, with a chisel edge rather than a point. The dress of the men consists of the short kilt with an animal's tail attached at the back; they all wear beards and most have feather headdresses. Apart from the lions, the animals depicted are the gazelle, hartebeest, hare, jackal, ostrich and a species of deer. In the middle of the palette, but slightly offset towards the wider end, is a flat area surrounded by a raised ring, imitating the circular depressions used for grinding eye-paint on functional palettes. At the broad end are two items which have attracted much attention, one being a representation of a shrine and the other a mythical beast consisting of the linked fore-parts of two buffalo. The entire surface of the palette is covered with fine scratches, made in the process of carving the relief. A fragment is missing from the middle of one side, whilst the upper left section is completed by the cast of the Louvre fragment.

They were registered with the provenance marked as 'Tell el-Amarna', probably due to confusion with other objects acquired from that site at the same time.
