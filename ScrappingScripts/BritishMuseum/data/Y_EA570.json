{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA570"], "Description": [" Limestone block statue of the male official Sahathor on a slim rectangular base. He wears a smooth shoulder-length wig set low on his brow and tucked behind his large ears. His eyes are rounded with a thin incised line at his upper eyelid, and his eyebrows are conveyed by a subtle ridge which slopes down at the temple. His nose is short and broad at the tip, and his mouth is wide with thick, pursed lips. His face is particularly rounded and fleshy at the jawline. He is shown squatting on the ground with his knees drawn up to the chest, and his clothing enveloping the entire body with the exception of his feet and hands. His arms are crossed over his knees, and his limbs are suggested through visible curves at the front of the block form indicating his arms, elbows, and the lower legs. His waist is also narrowed at either side of the body. Two columns of incised text are carved across the front of the block form, and around the edges of the statue base a continuous horizontal line of text is also inscribed. Sahathor has suffered damage to his nose, mouth, left ear and chin, and there are small chips visible across the wig. The corners of the statue base are also damaged, and there are various further small chips to the stone across the front and both sides of the block form.

The funerary inscription within the stela mirrors the text also found on the statue, with evocations of deities such as Osiris and Anubis. Sahathor lived during the reign of Amenemhat II in the Twelfth Dynasty, and these monuments originated from Abydos (PM V). The funerary focus of both inscriptions has led to suggestions that the monument was likely intended for a tomb chapel setting (James and Davies 1983), possibly along the processional route towards Osiris\u2019 principal cult centre (Simpson 1974; Russmann 2001), though their exact provenance remains unknown.
