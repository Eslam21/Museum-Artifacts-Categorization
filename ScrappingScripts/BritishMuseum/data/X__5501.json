This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Three limestone heads from Naukratis wear the so-called Cypriot cap. This form of head-covering derives from the Nothern Assyrian and South-Eastern Anatolian art of the 8th and 7th centuries. It is a pointed headpiece - probably made of leather - with side flaps which were usually tied up. In Cypriot art it is worn by male statues and statuettes in a long chiton and mantle, some enthroned figures, the hunter (Nick 2006, cat. 8) and the leopard-fur-wearer (Nick 2006, cat. 10), apparently without social restrictions though it is not worn by naked figures, lion-tamers, or those wearing aprons or trousers. The facial features of this head and the tightly-fit cap can be compared to those of heads from Idalion which are dated to the first quarter of the sixth century by Senff (Nick 2006, 112, 53-4, cat. 17, pl. 9).
