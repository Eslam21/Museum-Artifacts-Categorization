{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 27215", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "COSMETIC AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND IMPLEMENTS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "14 cm", "Width": "25 cm", "Name": "Painted Cosmetic Box on Wooden Legs", "Description": "A small, painted cosmetic box rests on four short wooden legs. The outside of the box is painted black and is decorated with elaborate geometric designs in white, yellow, red, and black on all sides. The interior is divided into several compartments, in which small perfume and cosmetic vessels would be kept. The lid has two parts and opens upward on horizontal pivots; pairs of opposed knobs are provided by means of which the two parts of the lid could be tied shut and sealed. Apparently this box could be classified as a funerary object rather than a container used during the lifetime of its owner."}
