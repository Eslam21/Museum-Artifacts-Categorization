{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86257"], "Description": [" Complete scarab, made of steatite. Fine details carved, whitish-beige colour with incised lines. The surface of the scarab shows small cracks and might therefore be glazed in white. The division between elytra and prothorax is indicated by an incised line, as is the suture. The suture line stops 0.2 cm above the perforation, showing two perpendicular short lines. Both humeral callosities are shown by triangles. Head and clypeus and plates are shown, clypeus with 4 lobes preserved, the left plate is partly broken off. The eyes are not visible. The side shows three legs in relief on each side on top of a base line. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. Three figures visible standing on two lines. In the middle Amun with the double feather crown, facing right, behind him on the left maybe a falcon headed deity facing right, with a sun disc above the head (not directly on top of the head), to the right of Amun facing left another figure, probably also falcon-headed. Two signs above the head, lower one probably sun disc. High quality. Perforation along its longitudinal side.
