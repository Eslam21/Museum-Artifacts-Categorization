Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-5). Gorton, A.
