Scaraboids in the shape of a ram's head pertain to a common series produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. This piece belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype B26-29, see especially B27 for this piece).
