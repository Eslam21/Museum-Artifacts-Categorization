The modern inscription 'DIOSK' is found on the second, joining sherd suggesting it was found in the region of the sanctuary of the Dioskouroi situated further north of the sanctuary of Hera. The number A 1668 2 is written on a sticker glued to the exterior surface of the sherd. The dipinto dedication indicates the sherd as belonging to a Hera cup, of which a number were found at Naukratis. Hera cups appear to have been exclusive to Samos and Naukratis and Schlotzhauer has suggested that those found at Naukratis may have first been used at the Heraion in Samos and then brought to Naukratis as an aphidryma in the deliberate transplantation of cultic objects between sanctuaries (Schlotzhauer 2006 313). Following Furtw\u00e4ngler's typology of Samian Hera cups, the sherd belongs with his Type I-III (Furtw\u00e4ngler 1989 88, fig. 14). Although this sherd was not subjected to clay analysis, the fabric and shape bear striking similarities with other Hera cups from Naukratis (British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888,0601.403 and 1888,0601.405) that were analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford (Boardman 1986 665, 701 Table. 8.18 no. 48-51). The fabric from these other Hera cups was also analysed via NAA by Mommsen (Bonn) and the fabrics were all placed in Group J (Samos). Schlotzhauer suggests that these cups were produced in an area near the Heraion on Samos specifically for cult purposes (given the dipinto dedications) and, including British Museum 1888,0601.404, these cups may even have formed part of the same batch, given the similarity of the cup shape and fabric.
