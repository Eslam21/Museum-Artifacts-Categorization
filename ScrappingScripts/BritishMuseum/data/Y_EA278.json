{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA278"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Qenhikhepeshef: a round-topped stela divided into two sections by a horizontal strip which is largely blank. The upper register bears a scene in sunk relief. The goddess Hathor is seated on a throne before an altar covered with offerings. Behind her stands a personified 'ankh'-symbol holding up a fan. An invocation to Hathor, Amun-Ra and Mut is incised in six columns. In a further column on the right the name of the owner's mother, N\u1ec9wt-n\u1e2bt is inscribed. On the left side of the horizontal dividing strip the names of the owner's sons, Nbt-st\u0292 and 'lmn-(m)-\u1e25b, are incised. The main body of the stela consists of a prayer to Hathor by the workman Qenhikhepeshef, son of the workman \u1e2a\u02bf-(m)-nwn in twelve columns of incised text. He names his wife, the lady of the house, T\u0292-nfrt, and his sons 'Imn-n\u1e2bt and K\u0292-(m)-pr-Pt\u1e25. The figure of Qenhikhepeshef kneeling with arms raised in an attitude of worship is carved in raised relief at the bottom right of the stela. Part of his wig is depicted under his chin. On the left of the figure the name of his daughter N\u1ec9wt-n\u1e2bt is incised. The text of this stela exhibits a number of errors in spelling and placement of signs. The stela is in a good state of preservation apart from some damage on the edges. There are no traces of colour.
