{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Plaster figure of Aphrodite-Venus standing, modelled in the round and surviving from the neck to below the knees. Aphrodite is nude, holding her hair with her right hand, her left hand is by her side (possibbly an attempt to copy Aphrodite of Cnidus). The composition is flat. The object appears to be mould-made, but no casting webs can be seen. Probably originally painted, though no clera traces of paint remain.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " No known provenance, Bolton Museum register suggests Naukratis as a possible provenance, but this is crossed out and replaced by Bubastis. Described as calcite, though the material resembles plaster or Kaolinite (pipe-clay). Plaster figures are rarely preserved. Roman plaster parallels from Oxyrhynchus and Alexandria exist (Bailey 2008, GR 1897,1026.1; Adriani 1940, pl. lxxii:1\u20132). However, closest parallels come from central Gaulish workshops of terracotta figures in 'pipe-clay' (BM 1854,1130.42), suggesting that the Naukratis provenance is unlikely.
