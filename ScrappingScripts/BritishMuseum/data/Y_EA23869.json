{"artifact_name": "buckle", "Object Type": ["buckle"], "Museum number": ["EA23869"], "Description": [" Corroded fragment of a copper alloy small buckle, comprising two broken parts attached by corrosion : the side of a flat frame in the form of an eight-shaped double loop (one loop of \"pelta\" type, with ends curling inward, welded on top of an oval or possibly D-shaped one), and a short central prong, with a pointing and curved tip and a thicker end grasping one of the loops in the centre of the frame. On the back of the frame fragment are welded two short rectangular strips of metal, pierced by a small round hole (one with the top partly broken and missing), which were certainly used for fastening another part of the fitting.
