{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 21862", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "HAMMERING", "Height": "19.5 cm", "Name": "Shawabti of Amon-Mes", "Description": "This shawabti depicts Amon-Mes, the Royal Scribe and the Overseer of the Cattle. A shawabti is a statuette intended to perform work in place of the deceased in the underworld. It is fully covered in mummy wrappings except for his hands, which hold hoes for his work in the netherworld. The shawabti of Amon-Mes shows the owner wearing a long wig ending in two locks and a broad collar. His arms are crossed on his chest. The rest of the figure below the arms has a short version of Chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead, written from right to left. The writing says \"O ye shawabti, if any call out concerning me to do any of the works which are done in the necropolis to make the fields flourish, to irrigate the river-bank lands, to transport sand from East to West. 'Here I am!' you shall say if someone calls my name.\""}
