The name of the second official is not visible on either specimen. Since, on nearly all of Yaz\u012bd's stamps, where a second name is visible, it is that of \u1e24ayy\u0101n, it is most likely that the die of this type also bore the same name. However, the discovery of OA+ 4285, on which Yaz\u012bd II is associated with Us\u0101ma b. Zayd means that the possibility that this type bore the name of Us\u0101ma cannot be entirely ruled out."], "Bibliographic references": ["Morton 1985 / A Catalogue of Early Islamic Glass Stamps (28)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["food/drink"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Abu Khalid Yazid II ibn 'Abd al-Malik"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["OA+.4009"]}
