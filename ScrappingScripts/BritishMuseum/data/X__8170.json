", " Discoid weights are not that commonly found in Egypt in general, though they do appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 2, fig. 13 and fig. 26). Like this specimen, they are usually of small size and mass, and, made out of igneous rock such as basalt, granite and diorite. They do also occur regularly in copper alloy/bronze, notably in the Naukratis collection. These weights can be associated to the most used standard in Naukratis, the Egyptian standard kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples (Petrie 1926, 14; Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 25). The Greek drachma can also be linked with discoid weights as attested for example by Greek inscriptions found on some of these weights (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 25). This specimen seems actually associated to the Attic drachma standard (4.32 or 4.37g: see van der Wilt 2010, 160; our specimen weights half of 4,37g) and not to the kedet. Egypt in the Ptolemaic period used to mint fractions and multiples of the drachma, especially in bronze (von Reden 2001). However, the Ptolemaic drachma was progressively reduced to around 3.6g under Ptolemy I (on this reduction: Pr\u00e9aux 1939, 269; de Callata\u00ff 2005, 118; Gorre, G. 2012, 110). This weight could therefore be dated between the early 5th century when the Attic drachma at 4.3g was well established and the late 4th century BC. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
