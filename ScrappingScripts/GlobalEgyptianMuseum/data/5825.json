{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "9125", "Dating": "25TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "GOLD; HAEMATITE/RED OCHRE", "Technique": "FULL CAST; GROUND", "Height": "3.8 cm", "Width": "1.6 cm", "Name": "Ram with the atef-crown", "Description": "The mighty horns, on which the small ears are resting, are bent in a prominent forward curve. This identifies the figure as the ram of Amun. The crown is made of solid gold and attached to the skull with a small dowel. It is assumed that this ram was once inserted into a ring, as rings with three-dimensional additions are known from the New Kingdom. Another possibility is that it served as a pendant with an attachment over the back of the animal. Its style points to a date in the Ethiopean Period. The ram manifestation of Amun was the principal deity of the Ethiopian rulers, who wore a head of the god around their necks."}
