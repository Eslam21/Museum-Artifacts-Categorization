Enamelling is also not Venetian in style. Flat disc in stem is a French feature. For French tradition of marriage cups in glass see article in Glass Studies Journal by Suzanne Gaynor 1991. But compare also the unique glass in Bologna Museo Medievale which has the Flight into Egypt upon it and is traditionally attributed to Angelo Barovier workshop, mid 15th C. This has same blue metal and even more strikingly the same distinctively-made blue knop on high foot and folded footring, though not the moulded base to the cup. The painting style of the faces and costumes seems to me to suggest the same workshop and even the same enameller, making this a rare glass.
