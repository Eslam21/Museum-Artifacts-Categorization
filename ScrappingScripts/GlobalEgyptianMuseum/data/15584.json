This stela is decorated above with a cavetto cornice, which is a cornice with a concave molding having a quarter circle curve. The stela is also decorated with the Shen sign of power. The stela has scenes in two registers, or sections. In the first register, the god Osiris wears his Atef crown. The owner of the stela is standing in front of Osiris making offerings with his wife and children positioned behind him. The second register depicts a scene in which offerings are presented to the owner. Two figures of the jackal god Wep-Wawet, the opener of the roads and the patron deity of the necropolis, are shown facing each other. The style of the relief is influenced by the Amarna style of art as seen in the owner's kilt and the cones of perfumed ointment on the heads of his followers."}
