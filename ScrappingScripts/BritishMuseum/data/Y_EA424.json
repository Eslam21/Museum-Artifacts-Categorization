{"artifact_name": "offering-table", "Object Type": ["offering-table"], "Museum number": ["EA424"], "Description": [" Limestone offering-table of A[mu]n...: the shape of this offering-table is based on the form of the alter ideogram, the base of which represents the area for the reception of offerings, while the 'loaf' on top forms the spout. The offering area, which is depressed below the surface of the rim, is covered with representations of offerings carved in shallow sunk relief. The upper surface of the rim bears incised texts invoking funerary offerings on behalf of the workman A[mu]n-... whose full name is lost; in the right-hand text Osiris is invoked and in the left-hand text Horakhty-Atum is named. To the right and left of the 'loaf' are cut the names of Bw-\u1e33n t.f and the lady of the house, Nbw-m-ws\u1e2bt who are presumably husband and wife. The lower left-hand edge and most of the bottom edge have been lost, and the right-hand edge is chipped in places. The losses have been restored in modern times. There are no traces of colour.
