", " Parallels from, or likely from Naukratis (British Museum EA90389 and GR1973,0501.28; Bailey 2008, no.3202, EA M100; Louvre E20834, previously the Musee Guimet, Dunand 1990,108, no. 252). The Louvre example comes from Naukratis, whilst the others were unprovenanced or have lost their provenance, but Naukratis is the most likely source for this objects, based on their style, fabric, date and collections history of these objects. Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC38349, see UC48390) and in limestone (late 6th to early 5th BC parallels from Sais, Daressy 1901, 230-239) and faience parallels from Palaepaphos, Cyprus (Clerc 1988, 53-8, pl.16, Kouklia Museum no.86, dated \u2018Saite\u2019) and unprovenanced (British Museum EA1988,0229.1 EA71017). Probably late 4th to 3rd century BC, though some parallels are likely earlier. Bailey, D.M. 2008, Catalogue of Egyptian Terracottas in the British Museum, IV, London. Clerc, G. 1988.
