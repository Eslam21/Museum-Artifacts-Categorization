The largest animal, to the left of this and facing right, is dark brown, with no horns and identifiable as a bull. Those to either side are identifiable as cows with udders. The leftmost is brown and white bichrome with brown u-shaped horns. Above these three are two mature cows, centre and right, and one calf, left. The mature cows have udders, with naturalistic brown and white bichrome coat pattern markings and long, white, lyre-shaped horns. The calf is white. The cow facing left has three vertical white \u2018bar\u2019 markings on the neck and one across the muzzle (collar? Halter?).
