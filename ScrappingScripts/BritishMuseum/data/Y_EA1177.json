All three were recorded in-situ by W. J. Bankes in 1815/16. The two similar stelae of Intef-dedu were removed from the temple by Sir (then Captain) Henry Lyons in 1892 and apparently sent to the British Museum, but only EA1177 was recorded as arriving at the Museum. The main horizontal text is considered to be partially autobiographical, recording Intef-dedu as \u2018hereditary noble and local prince, royal seal-bearer and sole friend (of the king), great one of the king of Upper Egypt, magnate of the King of Lower Egypt, chief of secrets of what (only) one may hear\u2019 (Landgr\u00e1fov\u00e1 2011, 247), along with other praises and hints at events as commander of the fortress.
