Palomino embellishes his assessment observing how Camilo was so inclined toward sweet and devout subjects that when he painted mythological works for Philip IV's palace, the king was not satisfied, and observed that Jupiter looked like Jesus Christ (A. Palomino, 'Lives of the Eminent Spanish Painters and Sculptors', trans. N. Ayala Mallory, Cambridge 1987, p.233). Camilo was a prolific painter whose work embodies a type of religious art greatly admired in Spain around the mid seventeenth century. It is characterised by carefully arranged multi-figure compositions that present the subject in a direct and unambiguous way. In this drawing his refined and modulated use of brush and ink complements the intimacy of the subject. The main elements of the drawing correspond to a painting known only though a photograph (Harris 1960). In both works the recumbent Christ Child is identical, his right arm raised, right leg and foot lowered, the left foot supported by the Virgin. The angel in the upper left is also the same, he moves forward, his outstretched right hand offering dates, his left hand resting on a cloud. However, the differences between the two works suggest that the drawing was possibly for another painting of the subject, or a model from which elements could be copied in more than one composition, a common practice in Spanish seventeenth-century art. A survey of Camilo\u2019s drawings suggests they played a sophisticated role in his work. Some are squared for transfer and relate to surviving compositions whereas others seem to have been made as independent works, forming a library of images. These would have served a very practical use for Camilo who worked for clients in Madrid, Segovia, Salamanca and Toledo where knowledge of his compositions could have been conveyed through his drawings. The drawing once belonged to the Madrid artist and collector Francisco de Sol\u00eds (1620-84) whose name appears in the bottom centre. The inscription in the upper part of the drawing 'de Camilo' is probably also by Sol\u00eds for it is in the same hand and agrees with his practice of writing attributions on drawings (see L.A. Banner, 'Francisco de Sol\u00eds: A seventeenth-century artist-collector', Master Drawings, XLV, 2007, pp. 359\u201366). Literature E.
