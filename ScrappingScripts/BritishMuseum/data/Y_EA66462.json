Cowroids are relatively rare in the corpus of scaraboids from Naukratis. Such shape was produced locally in the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). Several examples similar to this specimen were found in Naukratis, notably in the 'Scarab Factory' (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 52). Though not listed in Gorton's typology, this scaraboid would fit well her type XXVIII B (Gorton 1996, 103-105). Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory'. The hieroglyphs could be used here for their magical value, as suggested by Gorton for most of Naukratis scarabs (Gorton 1996, 93). Petrie interpreted the inscription as the name of Psamtek I (Petrie 1889, pl. 60, no. 1899). However, the Horus name of Psamtek I is Aa-jb and the jb-heart sign would have been replaced here by the sun-disc. Another possible interpretation would be to see a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). Instead of the aA-column, however, it should be a wadj-column. Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
