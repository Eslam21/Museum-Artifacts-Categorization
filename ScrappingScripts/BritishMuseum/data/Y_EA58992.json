{"artifact_name": "breast-ornament; mummy-wrapping; scarab", "Object Type": [" breast-ornament ", " mummy-wrapping ", " scarab "], "Museum number": ["EA58992"], "Description": [" Glazed composition funerary scarab: the wings and central depression into which the scarab has been inset were moulded all in one from bluish green glazed composition. The back is flat, but the upper surface of the wings, representing those of a falcon, have well modelled details of the individual feathers. The scarab itself, made separately in a mould, has a convex underside and no indication of the legs. Its back has the usual markings. Eleven holes are pierced at irregular intervals around the edge of the piece so that it could be stitched on to the mummy wrappings over the chest or incorporated into the bead net, which enveloped contemporary mummies.
