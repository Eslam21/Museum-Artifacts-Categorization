The face is squarish and full, with the features highly stylized. The perfectly almond-shaped eyes, the almost total absence of eyebrows, and the small, slightly prominent mouth are all characteristics that date to the early Ptolemaic Period. At this time, art in Egypt still displayed a noticeable dependence on the Egyptian styles of earlier periods. The lower part of the legs is missing. The right arm is held to her side with the hand open, while the left is folded below the breast on which a floral scepter, the emblem of queens, rests. Around the woman's neck is a large collar."}
