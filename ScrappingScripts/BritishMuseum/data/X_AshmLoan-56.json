This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The decorative motif finds parallels with South Ionian Little Master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Schlotzhauer Type 9C. Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana, band and Gordion cups. Details of technique can be found on Euboean and Boeotian imitations of Attic work. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus.
