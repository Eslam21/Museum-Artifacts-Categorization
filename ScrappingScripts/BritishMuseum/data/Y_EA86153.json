The base is flat and very well smoothed while the outer surface of the vessel is less smoothed but still polished and therefore the stone is darker in the top part of the vessel. The inside of the vessel has a diameter of 2.1 cm and shows several lines from the drill, no further polishing of the inside took place. Small part at the rim chipped off at the inside.
