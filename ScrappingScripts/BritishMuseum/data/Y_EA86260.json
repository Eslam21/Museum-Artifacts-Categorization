Whitish-beige colour with incised lines, glazed in white. The division between elytra and prothorax is indicated by two short notches of about 1mm of lenghts, while the suture is not visible. Head and eyes are visible, clypeus is quite large and very detailed, showing two rows of vertical lines indicating the lobes. The lower one shows five lobes and the upper one three. The plates are shown in detail in contrary to other scarabs. The side shows all legs carved in relief, with small lines indicating the hairs. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. Three standing deities on top of a mr-sign. Above them a sun disc with two uraei, one in each direction. To the right Amun with the double feathered crown, facing to the left, holding hands with the pharaoh in the middle, wearing probably the blue crown, facing right. Behind pharaoh on the left, also holding hands with him, a falcon headed deity, facing to the right with a sun disc above, probably Re-Harakhte. The same motif is shown on scarab 560. Perforated along the longitudinal side.
