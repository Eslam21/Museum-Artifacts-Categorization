{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10753,1"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum E"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum E, Frame 1. Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in linear hieroglyphic script (eleven fragments) and hieratic. The recto contains a funerary liturgy for ceremonies at a mastaba, while on the verso there is a (later) administrative text with remains of ruled lines, possibly recording distribution of grain. The text is written in vertical columns with titles in horizontal lines, in retrograde script. This frame contains lines 1-12. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The liturgy is fragmentary and obscure. 'The first [line] to convey any clear sense is [line] 6, where a sacrificial bull with legs tied together was named' (Gardiner, JEA 41, 11). Lines 9 and 10 mention figs and wine. The verso text is a series of accounts (undated), mentioning granaries, perhaps a 'scatter of private holdings within a single estate' (Quirke, Administration, 190). The hand resembles that of the jottings on P. Ramesseum 3 (unpublished). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
