It appears that there was an inscribed text at the back and the sides of the statue that had been deliberately removed. The statue shows the youthful king with his characteristic features; narrow eyes, small mouth, and nearly oval face. He wears a composite crown consisting of a diadem encircled by figures of cobras (uraei), above which are two outstretched horns and two tall plumes with the sun disk between them; these are flanked by two cobras. The face of the king is framed by his thick curled wig, which hides his ears and is surmounted by the uraeus (cobra)."}
