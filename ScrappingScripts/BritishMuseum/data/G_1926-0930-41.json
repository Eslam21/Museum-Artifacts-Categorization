{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.41"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Eros. Eros standing, his left leg advanced and his body twisted to his left. He has curly hair with a central braid, and wears a garland round his neck. In his right hand he holds up a folding mirror, open to show the circular mirror and its case, and has a casket in the crook of his left arm. There is only summary treatment at the back, although the hair is well indicated; a splodge of clay near the small of the back is presumably fortuitous, although it resembles the tail of a satyr. There is no plinth, but remains of plaster over the feet may indicate that it was set into a separate stand. Hollow; two-piece mould. Orange-brown Nile silt, with traces of an overall white dressing.
