A royal mummy could require as many as a hundred meters of the finest linen bandages. Amulets were wrapped into the layers of bandage at the places dictated by their function. For example, a heart amulet was placed on the chest to protect the real heart. When the bandaging was complete, the mummy would be covered with a shroud. The shroud was decorated with figures of Osiris, god of the dead, and sometimes with spells from the Book of the Dead."}
