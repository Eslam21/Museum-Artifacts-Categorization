{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86248"], "Description": [" Very small scarab, completely preserved, made of glazed steatite. No remains of a glaze preserved. No division between head and prothorax. The prothorax is divided by short horizontal grooves above and below, the humeral callosities are shown by a vertical short line, leaving from the lower division line of the prothorax. At the lower part of the back a small incised line following the perforation hole. The shape of the head is triangular, the eyes are roughly indicated, the clypeus is shown by a second triangular upside down, but the lower point sits asymmetrical to the right of the head. The side of the scarab shows one circumferential line, dividing the scarab from the base plate, no legs are indicated. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. Very stylized hieroglyphs show two vertical lines at each end, leaving a nb-basket at the ends which are filled with vertical lines. In the middle field a quite rough mn-sign above a horizontal line (n), underneath a sun disc and a vertical stroke (Z4), if the vertical nb-basket stands for the J, then it can be read as 'Imn-R'. The orientation of the seal is transversal while the perforation of the object is longitudinal.
