{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63807", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING; PAINTED", "Height": "9 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of a Person Seated in Front of a Fire", "Description": "This ostracon has a small sketch that depicts an almost nude adult, sitting on a high stool, raising his left hand to protect himself from the heat of a strong flame in front of him. The adult's body is colored dark brown and it is hard to determine if he is wearing a kilt; the upper part of his body is apparently nude. The hairstyle suggests that he is a youth, but the artist represented him as a fat person, which may be seen from the curved surface of his stool. This sketch could be an attempt by the artist to capture a little of the life he saw around him."}
