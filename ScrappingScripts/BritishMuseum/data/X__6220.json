This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Though the motif is crudely executed, it can be identified as an ibex and was identified as such by Gorton (in Gorton 1996, 97). Ibex was a popular motif on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). It belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 96-97, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A127-139, see especially A130 for this piece). Some examples of scarabs and scaraboids from Naukratis displaying this motif are illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 15-19 and Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 10-12. Very similar design on a scarab from Cagliari in Sardinia (Scandone 1975, 66, pl. XVII, E33).
