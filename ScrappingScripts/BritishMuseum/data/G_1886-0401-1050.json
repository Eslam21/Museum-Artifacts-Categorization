Vroulian amphorai are not commonly found, only a very few examples were found in Rhodes. nonetheless, Kinch's typology for Vroulian amphorai (Kinch 1914 185-7) consists of three groups and this sherd probably belongs to Group A. The pattern decoration and techinque suggests that this sherd is contemporary with the Vroulian cups with everted rims."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GN.01) (phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.1050"]}
