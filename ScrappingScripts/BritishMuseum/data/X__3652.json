This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This monument was possibly part of the sacred furniture of the Egyptian temple in Naukratis. It could could correspond to an altar base, a stand for an incense burner or a libation-vessel (Yoyotte 1994-95, 675). It could probably belong to a specific type of libation-vessel, an Hathoric basin. The later hypothesis would fit well with the dedications to Mut and Hathor of Baded. The inscription mentions the wealth, generosity and honesty of an individual called Nekhtnebef, son of Tefnakht and Nesnebethut. Curiously, the inscription details mainly his success as a businessman and his kindness towards the people but does not inform so much on his functions or titles. Tefnakht, the father of Nekhtnebef, is maybe the same as Tefnakht son of Imu from the statue kept in Cairo Museum JE 41301. This sculpture, probably from Memphis, mentions Pr-Mryt as well as the local gods of Naukratis Amun-Ra Baded and Osiris Lord of Baded.
