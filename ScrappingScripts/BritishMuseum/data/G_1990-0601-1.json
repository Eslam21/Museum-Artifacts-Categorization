A flask in the form of a bust of a Nubian, naked, with layered hair; he wears a twisted necklace. The back is plain, but the hair is well shown behind. On top of the head is the carinated narrow mouth of the flask, flanked by pierced handles. The handles are worn in a way that indicates the flask was suspended for some time on a metal chain, perhaps for use in the baths. Two-piece mould.
