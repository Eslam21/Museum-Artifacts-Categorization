", " The identification of the male figure as Neferhotep seems incorrect (on Neferhotep bronze figures: Weiss 2012, 97-98, 544-548, pl. 6c-g, Typ 21, esp. Nr. 102 for this specimen). On the registers of the museum, the figure is described as wearing a high headdress and fitted with a suspension ring at the back of the head. Such description fits also with a representation of the male deity Nefertum. Although we have not seen this piece directly, the photography kindly provided by the Museum of Fine Arts is clear enough to identify the deity as Nefertum. Several amuletic figures of Nefertum in copper alloy, but as well in stone and glazed composition, were found in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming; on Nefertum bronze figures: Weiss 2012, 105-106, 557-561, pl. 8c- e, Typ 27, esp. Nr. 147 and 151 from Naukratis).
