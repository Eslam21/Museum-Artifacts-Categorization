Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 28-30, see especially 28 for this specimen). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A91-107, see especially A91 for this piece). The motif is very close to Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.5, though this one shows additional incised details and seems to have been incised rather than stamped. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
