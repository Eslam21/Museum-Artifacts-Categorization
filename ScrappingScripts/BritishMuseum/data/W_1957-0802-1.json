A transparent blue glaze gives the jar a deeper colour in contrast with the grey-green slip-painted wares of this group. Sultanabad wares often display Chinese inspired motifs, but the appearance of similar lotuses on the Mamluk mosque lamp in this case shows that such motifs reached Egypt and Syria as well. This would have occurred either directly from China or through an Ilkhanid filter as a result of close contact between the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids both in war and peace."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hayward 1976 / The Arts of Islam (368) ", " Komaroff & Carboni 2002 / The Legacy of Genghis Khan: Courtly Art and Culture in Western Asia, 1256-1353 (135) ", " Lane 1957 / Later Islamic Pottery: Persia, Syria, Egypt, Turkey (fig.3) ", " Soustiel 1985 / La c\u00e9ramique islamique (fig.239) ", " Pinder-Wilson 1952 / Recent Acquisitions of Islamic Pottery (p.82) ", " Stoke-On-Trent Museum and Art Gallery 1949 / Guide to the Collection of Early Islamic Pottery Lent by Sir Ernest Debenham, Bart, 1949 (fig.13) ", " Akbarnia et al 2018 / The Islamic World: a History in Objects (p.146, fig.1) "], "Location": ["On display (G42/dc5)"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2003 13 Apr-27 Jul, Los Angeles, Los Angelese County Museum of Art (LACMA), 'The Legacy of Genghis Khan: Courtly Art and Culture in Western Asia, 1256-1353' 2002-2003 5 Nov-16 Feb, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Legacy of Genghis Khan: Courtly Art and Culture in Western Asia, 1256-1353' "], "Subjects": ["lotus"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Sir Ernest Ridley Debenham, 1st Baronet"], "Acquisition date": ["1952"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["1952,0214.5"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 05 Nov 2002"]}
