{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8459"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Pasherenast: there are four sections on this round-topped stela, each of which is surrounded by a multi-coloured border. At the top is a winged sun-disk with uraei between which is a 'kheper'-beetle and a \u0161n-sign. On either side of the uraei are 'wedjat'-eyes and recumbent jackals with flags. In the second register is a 'kheker'-frieze. At the top of the third section is a sky-sign below which is a scene. The deceased stands on the right with his arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooledby a lotus-flower. Behind the altar stand Ra-Horakhty, a winged Isis enfolding a \u0161n-sign, and the four sons of Horus. The bottom register consists of four lines of text containing a prayer on behalf of the chamberlain of the God's Wife Pasherenese, son of the chamberlain of the God's Wife 'Imn-\u1ec9r-d\u1ec9.s and the lady \u0292st-\u1ec9r-d\u1ec9.s. The stela has split in two, presumably along the line of the two planks which were used to make it, and has been repaired in modern times. The background of the stela is white. The scenes are separated from each other by a multi-coloured border of grey, blue, red, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in green. The disk is red with green upper wing edges, blue-dotted white upper wings, blue feathers on white middle wings, edged in red, and green lower wings with feathers distinguished in black and two black dotted patches with red borders. The lower wing border is also red. The uraei are green with a red and green crown respectively. The beetle is blue with black feet and a red disk. The \u0161n-sign is green with a red centre. The 'wedjat'-eyes are blue with a black pupil on white and a red patch between eye and eyebrow. The jackals are black with green flags. The 'kheker'-frieze is alternately green and blue with red ties. The sky-sign in the third register is blue with black dots. The deceased has a red-brown body, black wig, and white and green kilt. The text above him is black. The altar is blue with a black pot and green lotus edged in red. Ra-Horakhty has a white face with black features, white crown with green feathers edged in red, blue wig, grey collar, green body and sceptre, and red hands. Isis has a green body and face, blue wig and head-dress, and alternating areas of blue and green edged in red on her wings. The sign that she enfolds is green with a red centre. The sons of Horus have blue wigs, grey black-lined collars, green bodies and sceptres, and red hands. The faces of the first two are red with black features, the third black, and the last white with black features. The text in the fourth register is blue-black between blue and red dividing lines. The sides and back are plastered, although this has worn away along the edges.
