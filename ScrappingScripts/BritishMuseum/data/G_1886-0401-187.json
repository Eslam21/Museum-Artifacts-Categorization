Type 5C cups are the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site and coincide with Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9A and Type 9B cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. Both of these cup types coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type A2 or B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 49, no. 28) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.137) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo (?)"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.187"]}
