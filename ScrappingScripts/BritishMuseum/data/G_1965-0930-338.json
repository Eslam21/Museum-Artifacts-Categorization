Compare the spiked rosette on the exterior and the row of white strokes on the interior (Lemos no. 552, pl. 69). Lemos does not mention this sherd but she does mention others from the same vase, which she describes as coming from a mediocre, but big, chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group also display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1536) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.338"]}
