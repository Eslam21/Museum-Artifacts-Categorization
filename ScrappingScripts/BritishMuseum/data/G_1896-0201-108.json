Immediately below the neck on the front of the vase is a bull with long pointed horns, facing the right as is about to charge or butt an opponent; the beast is painted in black outline (quite faint on the lower body) with some internal detailing indicated with black lines over a white fill; the bull has a long tail which falls to the ground in a kind of loop; below the horizontal shoulder band is a large star-in-circle motif in black and white paint; vase assembled from fragments, with some restoration.
