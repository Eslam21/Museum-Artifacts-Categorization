{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA303"], "Description": [" Round-topped limestone stela of Qeh: In the topmost register the officiating priest, distinguished by his shaven head and panther skin, carries an arm shaped incense burner and pours water over a table of offerings, below which are depicted a wine jar and a large bunch of greenery in a footed container. Beyond sits Osiris, god of the dead, with the goddess of the West (the land of the dead) and jackal-headed Anubis, god of embalming. The hieroglyphic text, which include a cartouche for Amenhotep, is an offering formula asking for bread and beer, flesh and fowl, water, wine and milk on behalf of the deceased owner of the stela, the Superintendent of the storehouse for the offerings of the god Amun, Qeh.In the next register, Qeh himself is depicted drinking from a bowl while seated on a lion footed chair beside his wife Nedjempehy. Before them is another table heaped with foodstuffs. The remainder of this register and the whole of the register below are taken up by the figures of the couple's sons and daughters bringing birds for cooking, bouquets and a cos lettuce symbolizing virility. Further foodstuffs and drinks containers are depicted in a separate section. The surviving colour attempts to distinguish red brown male skin from the paler pink of females: no highly born woman would be shown with suntanned skin. Whereas Nedjempehy and her daughters are dressed fashionably in elaborate wigs and highly pleated linen garments, the goddess of the West wears an old-fashioned sheath dress with straps over the breasts and a long wig divided by her shoulders: goddesses were not swayed by fashion. Her skin is also distinctly yellow: the original flesh colour for women. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (late) ", " 19th Dynasty (?) "], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Abydos (?)
