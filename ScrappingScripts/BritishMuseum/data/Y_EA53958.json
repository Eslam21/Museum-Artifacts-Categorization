{"artifact_name": "stopper; seal-impression", "Object Type": [" stopper ", " seal-impression "], "Museum number": ["EA53958"], "Description": [" White plaster wine-amphora stopper with palm fibre or wood plug (now lost). The stopper is made from lime plaster or lime and gypsum mix that has aggregates such as silicates mixed in it. It has been impressed with a circular stamp and then painted red (only traces remain). The stamp appears to depict a Chi-Rho (29mm across) surrounded with Greek text, probably \u1f10\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3[\u1f77\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba]\u03c5\u03c1\u1f77\u03bf\u03c5. This stamp impression is partially covered with a later one made from a softer gypsum plaster layer, now mostly worn away, that also covers up an old fermentation hole. The black sealant around the edge of the stopper is probably pine pitch.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 5C; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 5). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1, 5C & 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1, 5C & 7). The black sealant around the edge of the stopper is probably pine pitch, and, together with the fermentation holes, confirm the stopper\u2019s use for closing a wine amphora (Thomas 2011, Tripolitanian type 5C; cf., Kellia examples, Egloff 1977, pl. 20.1). The fermentation hole suggests that the wine must have been young, not having finished fermenting when first transported. It then changed ownership and was resealed once it had finished fermenting. For the Chi-Rho motif, common in late Roman contexts in Egypt, cf., stamp from Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 28.10\u201312). See also, EA 53959. The Greek text, \u1f10\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3[\u1f77\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba]\u03c5\u03c1\u1f77\u03bf\u03c5, is perhaps a name and title (NB 112, NB Copt. 32) or a blessing formula (cf., plaster seal from Kellia, Egloff 1977, 181, pl. 20.5).
