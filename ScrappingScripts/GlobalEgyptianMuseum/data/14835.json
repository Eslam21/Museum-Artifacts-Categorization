{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 30948", "Dating": "HOR I/AUTIBRE", "Archaeological Site": "DAHSHOUR", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "170 cm", "Width": "27 cm", "Name": "Ka Statue of King Hor I/ Au-ib-Re", "Description": "This wooden structure is a magnificent, well-preserved masterpiece. It depicts the Ka statue of King  Hor I /Au-ib-Re, which is clearly marked by the Ka hieroglyphic sign as two upraised arms topping the head. The Ka, or guardian spirit, had to survive in the statue to keep its owner alive. The statue, found within its accompanying naos, or shrine, was covered with a fine layer of painted stucco. The king is sculpted wearing a three-part long wig, leaving the ears exposed. He wears a long, curved divine beard. It is noteworthy that the sculptor successfully modeled the inlaid eyes to lend a lifelike appearance to this expressive face. The eyes are inlaid with rock crystal and quartz. It seems that the Ka statue once held a scepter in its right hand and a staff in its left hand. The statue of the king was fixed to a wooden panel that could be taken out of the naos."}
