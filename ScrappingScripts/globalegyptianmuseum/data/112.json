This small object of faience represents a baboon and comes from the excavations of W. F. Petrie at Abydos. The baboon, known as the \"Great White\" (Hedj-Wer), was venerated from the Protodynastic Period onwards and had a sacred link with the god Khentimentiu at Abydos. It could be that this baboon god was assimilated with Thoth, god of wisdom and of writing, also represented in egyptian religion as a baboon."}
