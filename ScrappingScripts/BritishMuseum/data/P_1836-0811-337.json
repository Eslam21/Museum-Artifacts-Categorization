For example, the articulation of the wall near the window is mostly abandoned, the individual planks of the cupboard by the chair and the floor are largely suppressed, the fenestration is clarified, and the tablecloth by the window is darkened, allowing greater definition of the books resting on the table. As has often been noticed, the composition is related to other works produced by both Bol and Rembrandt between the late 1630s and 1642. The format of the design owes much to Rembrandt's print of 'St Jerome in a dark Chamber' of 1642 (Bartsch 105; Hind 201), in which a window acts as the single light source in a comparable way. This is also the case with the painting in the Louvre of the 'Holy Family with St Anne',[2] which although an upright composition, includes many of the motifs seen in the drawing, such as the bed, the basket hanging on the far wall and the wicker cradle. The construction of beams and floorboards provides further analogies between these works, some of them echoed in other compositions, most clearly in the painting of the 'Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard' in the Hermitage. This has also been assigned to the school of Rembrandt, but it could be an original by the master of around 1637.[3] Comparable interiors are also found in Bol's drawings, in particular the 'Annunciation' now in Veste Coburg, with its window illuminating a dark room, complete with similar furniture to that seen here (and a cat).[4] Bol also returned to the image of the breast-feeding mother on several occasions, as in his painting of the 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt', for which a preparatory drawing survives in the Louvre,[5] and in his drawing of the 'Holy Family' now in Darmstadt.[6] A painting, doubtless based on the etching, was on the art market in 1997,[7] and there is an early drawn sketch after the print, now in Weimar.[8] NOTES: [1] The date has sometimes been read as 1645 or 1649, but the reading 1643 is now generally accepted, and indeed seems almost beyond question in the best impression in the British Museum (1973.U.1548). [2] Corpus C87 (as perhaps by Bol; this remains a controversial reattribution), Bredius 563. [3] Corpus C88, Bredius 558. The Corpus suggested that it reflects a lost work of c.1637, but in the compiler's opinion it is more probably the original by Rembrandt. [4] Inventory no.Z2704, Sumowski 147x.

A variant is in Dresden (Sumowski, 'Gem\u00e4lde', I, no.81, repr.). The Louvre drawing, inv. no.RF29734, which has sometimes been connected with the 'Holy Family in an interior', is repr.
