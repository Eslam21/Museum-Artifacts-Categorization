{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86933"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is showing impressions of one coil of basketry on one side and two coils of basketry on the second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows a complete impression of a scarab-like seal with disturbance in the middle part of the seal, some finger impressions around it. The seal impression shows a circumferential line that thickens at the top. Visible is a bound captive on the left side, kneeling, facing towards the left, with his hands bound together at his back. Behind him on the right a seated lion with its front paws on the shoulder of the captive. Behind the back of the lion a small upright cobra, facing to the right. Underneath a bound captive, lying on his belly, with his hands and feet bound backwards. The same motif can be found on EA86927, EA86928, EA86930, EA86931, EA86932 and EA86934.
