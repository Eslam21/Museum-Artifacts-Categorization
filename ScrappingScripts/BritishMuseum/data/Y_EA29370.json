{"artifact_name": "pectoral", "Object Type": ["pectoral"], "Museum number": ["EA29370"], "Description": [" Glazed composition pectoral: this three coloured pectoral, an ornament worn on the chest, is made from yellow, purple, blue and white glazed composition, the purple on the upper face having been inlaid into the yellow. The shape imitates that of a pylon, the rectangular tower with slightly sloping walls which flanked the monumental gateway into an Egyptian temple. It even has the same cavetto cornice ornamentation along the top, a stylized representation of the curved reed heads which once surmounted walls made from vertical reeds daubed with mud. On all four sides of each face is a block decoration pattern. On the top surface a jackal reclining on a pylon shaped plinth is named as Anubis, god of embalming. In the writing of his name, the determinative shows this god's second manifestation: a (seated) man with a jackal's head. The underside depicts a 'djed' pillar, by this period believed to represent the stylized backbone with ribs of Osiris god of the dead, flanked by the Girdle of Isis or 'tit' amulet. Both were prescribed funerary amulets. Holes have been pierced through the cavetto cornice so the piece could be stitched to the bandages over a mummy's chest.
