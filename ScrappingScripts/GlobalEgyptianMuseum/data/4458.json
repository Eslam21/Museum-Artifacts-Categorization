The original accession card describes the face as red in colour, the wig was blue and yellow and a broad pectoral made up of lotus leaves. Two vertical columns of hieroglyphs extended the full length of the coffin and two down each side - of these only a broken inscription on the left side now remains. The exterior of the base is also damaged (see Text Comment in Advanced Mode/Textual Data).The interior is in better condition, at the head end are four horizontal lines of stars together with a single line of inscription, a htp-dj-nsw formula. On the floor of the coffin at the head is an udjat-eye and Anubis as a recumbent jackal, described as the 'Lord of the Sacred Land' etc. (images of coffin interior e-f). From the neck down the floor is decorated with two djed-pillars, a solar bark with an 'udjat-eye' on either side and the indistinct figures of several deities, again recorded in earlier documents as being Hathor, Anubis, the deceased and the four Sons of Horus together with a cartouche containing the name of Amenhotep I.
