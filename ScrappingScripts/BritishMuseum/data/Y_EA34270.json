{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA34270"], "Description": [" Basalt standing statue of the priest Pasherbastet: the way in which the head is cocked to one side, the treatment of the heavily lidded eyes with incised iris, and the rather tragic expression are noteworthy. The downturned mouth and the sharp line below the lower lip are characteristic of late first-century-BC royal portraits. The man wears a costume comprising a short-sleeved round-necked shirt, a wraparound skirt and a fringed shawl, whose mid-section he grasps in his left hand; the object in his right fist has been identified as a folded cloth, a symbol of aristocracy since early dynastic times. The figure strides on the left foot with one hand clenched, the artistic convention since the beginning of the dynastic period for representing male dynamism and capability for action. As a priest, the owner has a shaven head. The back pillar, which is rounded at the top and reaches the back of the head, supports the figure and was an architecturally necessary support for standing statuary but with inherent symbolism. It is incised with a column of hieroglyphs providing the name, titles and filiation of the owner.
