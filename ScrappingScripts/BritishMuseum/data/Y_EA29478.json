{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA29478"], "Description": [" Black granite naophorous figure of the kneeling male official Hornebkhaset on a slim rectangular base. The figure is depicted in a kneeling position and resting on his heels, while he supports a small naos shrine in his lap. The shrine contains the image of the funerary god Osiris, identifiable through his mummified form, feathered atef-crown, and the crook and flail implements held in his hands. Hornebkhaset wears a knee-length kilt which is belted at the waist and a smooth shoulder-length \u2018bag wig\u2019, a simple headcloth style typical of the 26th Dynasty. The chest is bare, with subtle modelling of the musculature of the upper body. The stone fill between the arms and torso is intact, often deliberately left to ensure the integrity of the stone sculpture. The face is rounded and fleshy, with wide almond shaped eyes and a slim nose. The mouth is small with the outer corners slightly upturned to suggest a small smile. The naos shrine contains a hieroglyphic inscription on either side of the fa\u00e7ade, and along the upper left and right side of the naos. Two columns of text are also inscribed on the back-pillar, and the text then continues onto a horizontal line of text around the base. Several cracks are visible across the upper body of the male figure at the neck, chest, and upper left arm, where modern repair of the stone has taken place. There are also further cracks visible at the top of the back pillar, and chips to the stone surface at the corners of the statue base and top of the naos shrine.

There is no provenance recorded for the statue, however based on the evocations of areas such as Smenou-hor, the 21st nome in Upper Egypt (also known as Crocodilopolis, perhaps near Kafr Ammar), it is possible that the statue originates from this area (Von Kanel 1984). The statue inscription also mentions several members of Hornebkhaset\u2019s family, including an individual named Pakhar \u2013 this seems to be the name of both his father\u2019s father and his mother\u2019s father, therefore this could potentially be intended to express respect for the same individual on both sides of the family (Von Kanel 1984).
