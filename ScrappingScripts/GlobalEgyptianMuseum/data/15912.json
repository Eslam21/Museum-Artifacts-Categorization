Below them is the source of water, a canal or possibly a pond complete with plants, a duck, and a wild hen. The arched opening in the wall is evidently to allow water to flow into the wheel system. To the left of the oxens, we can make out the figure of a boy who guards them and prods them on when necessary. The boy seems to be holding in his mouth something that could be a musical pipe."}
