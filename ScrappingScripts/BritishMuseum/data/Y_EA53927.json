Halite deposits from, for example, the shore-line evaporation of Holocene lakes in the Fayum and the Wadi Natrun, were exploited for the collection of natron used in the preparation of burials through the early Islamic period. Nevertheless, as Johnson\u2019s excavations were concentrated in the town\u2019s rubbish heaps\u2013\u2013and not the cemeteries of Antinoupolis\u2013\u2013it is more likely that this material was destined for consumption or food processing (e.g., salting meat) rather than funerary purposes.
