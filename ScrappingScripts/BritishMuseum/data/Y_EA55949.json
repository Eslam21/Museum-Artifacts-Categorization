It may conceivably be a receipt without a date; but it seems unlikely that receipts, except by an accident, would be issued without a date, and on the whole it is most probable that it was a note of the destination and, in most cases, nature and amount, of a consignment, sent with it as a check on full delivery. ", " As Mathias and Hor are both known as camel-drivers, it seems likely that they are the persons named in the inscription, the consignee not being mentioned; cf. too 1923,0327.477 (O.Sarga 201), where the camel-driver is named at the beginning. The ostracon is a palimpsest, traces (two lines) of an earlier text, written before this piece of pot was broken off, being visible at the top.
