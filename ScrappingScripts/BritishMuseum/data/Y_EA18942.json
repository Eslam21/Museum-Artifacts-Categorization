{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA189"], "Description": [" Limestone funerary stela showing Anubis presenting a man and a woman to Osiris: the two figures representing the deceased are escorted by the jackal-headed Anubis, who is apparently shown twice. The first of the pair to be presented is the man, who wears a long tunic and a mantle with a thin overfold draped over his left shoulder; his hair is cut short in Ptolemaic fashion. The woman beside him also has a Ptolemaic hairstyle, brushed back from the face. She wears a long tunic and a mantle draped over her left shoulder (the latter hidden by her companion). Osiris wears a tall crown and is seated on a throne, his head awkwardly turned to face the viewer. To his right stands Isis, wearing a horned disc on her head. All the deities wear broad collars; Isis and Osiris wear long tunics with either a border above the hem or a second tunic beneath; the escorting deities wear short tunics. The scene takes place on a ground-line; a narrow arch frames the top of the relief.

Similar scenes also occur on shrouds and stone reliefs of Roman date. Most recently, the relief has been ascribed to a local workshop of the first century AD. Bibliography: A.
