A painting of the same subject is mentioned by the XVIIc Bolognese historian Malvasia (1841 ed., I, p. 218) in the house of Marchesa Stampa in Milan. The latter might be the one that has recently come to light in an Italian private collection (a photograph of this is in the departmental dossier; illustrated on p. 192 in 2007 Procaccini exhibition). The departmental dossier states that an engraving, 16.8 x 10.8cm., of the temptation of Job rather than St Anthony but otherwise closer to the painting rather than the BM drawing (for example, the shrieking horned monster near the right edge is omitted) is in the Pepys Library, Cambridge (2977.225b). In the top right corner of the print there is a sheet with title: 'Le Livre de Job paraphrase par Mr Guillebert', and at the lower right edge the inscription: 'A Paris chez P. Rocolet' and a date 1641. There is also a mezzotint after the drawing when in Lely's possession by Abraham Blooteling (Wessely 68; BM impression 1850,1109.68). The BM drawing is far too elaborate and finished to be a preparatory study and is more likely a finished work in its own right inspired by the painting. It was exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1925 (illustrated in the catalogue, pl. XXXVI) and at the Magnasco Society, 1927, no. 9. Lit.: N.
