{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "6043", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; HIGH RELIEF; ENGRAVED", "Height": "60.4 cm", "Width": "46.5 cm", "Depth": "8.5 cm", "Name": "Stela of Ka-Ka-r", "Description": "Stela consisting of three separate pieces, which have been mounted in modern times in an arbitrary format. The left lower quarter of the stela is missing. In the curved lunette is the winged sun disc with accompanying text. In the register underneath is the usual offering scene: the female owner of the stela, Ka-Ka-r, is standing together with a couple in front of the gods Osiris, Isis and Nephthys. In the lower part of the stela are six incomplete lines of hieroglyphs. The relief is very shallow and simple, albeit well done. The style suggests a date in the 26th Dynasty."}
