{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "18107", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS ?", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; PAINTED", "Height": "38 cm", "Name": "Family group of Udjankhdjes", "Description": "The statue is a family group with the sitting male and standing female figure characteristic of the Old Kingdom art. The owner sits on a cubical block unseparated from the back \"wall\" of the composition. He wears a short kilt and a wig covering his ears and almost reaching his shoulders; natural locks are shown on the forehead dropped from under the wig. His clenched right fist resting horizontally on his lap holds an involute kerchief; the left hand is open. His wife stands to the left of the owner embracing his shoulders with her right arm; the left arm is lowered. She wears a tightly fitting dress reaching mid-shin and two bangles on each ankle. The head and left shoulder of the female figure are lost, but originally it was as high as the sitting man. The quality of work is not low, but the master was rather careless. The female figure is slanted outwards as if ready to fall, the neck of the man is too thick in profile, while the shape of the wig with a flat rear part and the parting turning into a shallow depression at the crown is abnormal. On the base, in front of the feet of the woman, the title and the name of the owner and the name of his wife are incised in two columns of hieroglyphs."}
