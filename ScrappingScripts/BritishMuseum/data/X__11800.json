XXXVII, no. 50). Lion scaraboids belong to a common series produced at Naukratis (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). Moulds to produce lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1896,0610.16 and BM 1896,0610.17. Numerous couchant lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis (see for example the ones illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos. 50, 64, 69, 80, 92, 99, 104). Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d. Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is either a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun / Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) or an abbreviated form for the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 165). This scaraboid belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B63-67, see especially B63 for this piece). The hieroglyphs depicted on the underside can be found on several scarabs and scaraboids of various shapes discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII nos. 47-48, 50): BM 1886,0401.1630 and BM 1886,0401.1631; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.684; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H3808.
