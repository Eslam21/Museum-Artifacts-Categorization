The recto contains six times the third verse of Psalm 28. On the verso, one notices six times the Greek alphabet followed by six supplementary Coptic signs and some Greek vowels. The tablet  probably has a magical context: the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet and the six Coptic letters represent the divinities invoked during the 30 days of the solar month and the vowels symbolise the seven spheres of the universe."}
