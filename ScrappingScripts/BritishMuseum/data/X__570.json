{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a female worshipper carrying a bird (dove?) for sacrifice. She is wearing a veil which is lifted above the forehead and falls behind the ears onto the back. She wears a long chiton. The neck is rather long. Her round face with its pointy chin has a small nose, a slim, lightly smiling mouth and large flatly worked ears. The eyes are large, round, slightly protruding and left in a rudimentary manner. The eyebrows are set high above and stretch to the root of the nose. The small, fine mouth is smiling slightly. She is standing, holding a bird tightly whose wings are spread with her strongly bent right arm crossed in front of her chest. Her left arm hangs by her side (mostly lost). The back is flat and roughly rendered. Upper body and torso fragment only, with the left arm, shoulder and frontal part of the bird with the right hand holding it broken off. Possibly traces of paint by left arm. Carved from greyish white limestone.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The fragmentary state of preservation of this figure leaves open the question whether the garment had a kolpos or not. Apart from three bird-carrying figures - including this one, Oxford 1888.220 (Nick 2006, cat. 29) and Boston 88.735 (Nick 2006, cat. 36) - belonging to roughly the same period, three later figures hold the same offering: London B460 (Nick 2006, cat. 37), Boston 88.736 (Nick cat. 41), and Cambridge GR.4.1899 (Nick 2006, cat. 42). The bird is most likely a dove, Aphrodite's animal which is supported by the findspot of two of these figure. The bird is rarely represented in female limestone figures from Cyprus but is a common feature in terracotta figures. Showing the bird with spread wings as in this figure is highly unusual and occurs in Lindos 1653-672 as well. A necklace might have been painted onto the neck. The unusually large ears can also be found in the early B456 (Nick 2006, cat. 30) and in London B457 (Nick 2006, cat. 34). Almost bloated hair like in this figure is also found in Cairo 27429 (Nick 2006, cat. 33). The round face can also be found in Cairo 27429 (Nick 2006, cat. 33) and Cambridge GR.2.1887 (Nick 2006, cat. 26). Nick 2006, cat. 31, p. 116, pl. 15; pp. 59-60. ", " Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
