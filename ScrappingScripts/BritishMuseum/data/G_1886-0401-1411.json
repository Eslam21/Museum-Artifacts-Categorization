{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1411"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure head of comedy actor wearing mask. A head of an actor, broken from a figure: with short curly hair, in a roll at the front and with a peak over the forehead, and indicated by gouges part way over the rear of the head. Heavy brows and jowls, high cheekbones and an open mouth; the bottom edge of the mask is indicated, the lower part of the head showing below. The figure would seem to represent an Old Woman of the New Comedy. The head is solid and the face may have been formed in a one-piece mould, with heavy subsequent hand-modelling, but is more likely to have been completely handmade. Overall white dressing with traces of orange-pink paint on the flesh. Red-brown Nile silt with frequent fine gold mica and quartz inclusions.
