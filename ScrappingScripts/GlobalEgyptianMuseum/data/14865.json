{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 4924", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "HELIOPOLIS", "Category": "KOHL", "Material": "FAIENCE; WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; TECHNIQUE OF CERAMICS", "Height": "5 cm", "Name": "Kohl Pot in the Shape of a Hedgehog", "Description": "Kohl was used as eye paint and was extracted from malachite (green copper ore), or galena (dark gray lead ore). Kohl was ground on slate palettes as early as the pre-dynastic period and was used to paint the eyelids for both cosmetic and hygienic reasons. It was either prepared as a compact mass of the finely-ground material made into a paste, or as powder. This kohl pot is in the shape of a hedgehog and has a wooden kohl stick. It once belonged to a household of a woman during the New Kingdom and was prepared as a piece of art showing this animal. The figure of the hedgehog with its spines could then act to protect the eyes from any harm, when it contained the kohl for painting the lashes and lids."}
