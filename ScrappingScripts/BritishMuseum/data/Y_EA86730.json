{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86730"], "Description": [" Quite small fragment of a seal-impression, the rear shows a somewhat rounded area although not much of the original surface is preserved. The fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The front shows a small and an almost completely round impression of a seal, though the lower part seems to be broken off. The motif is surrounded by a circumferential line. The upper part looks like a wsr-seated figure (mAa.t)-Ra stp[-n-R' ], to the right another sign of what might be a squatting baboon with a sun disc above the head. Some finger imprints to the right of the seal.
