The form is similar to Rhodian types of mid to late 7th century BC, which combined with a the assumption of a 615 BC settlement of Naukratis, guided Higgin's 615BC-600BC date. Similar examples from Memphis and elsewhere in Egypt are given Late Period or early Ptolemaic dates (Higgins 1954, 404; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148-9, pl. 40.1-5 no. 263-7; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, 137-9, pl.108-109, no. 202-209).
