{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA51028"], "Description": [" Heavy bronze axe-head: with long, thick lugs, concave sides and almost straight cutting edge. The narrowest point of the blade is somewhat nearer the butt than the cutting edge. The corners of the cutting edge are rounded. The blade has been completely cleaned. Hammer marks are present all over the blade, most visibly on the sides. Rough burrs remain on the edges beneath the lugs. They have been ground down on the other edges. The cutting end has been polished to a fairly smooth finish and then additionally ground to form a quite keen edge. There are no obvious signs of wear. There are casting faults on the butt and beneath one of the lugs.
