{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1926,0415.18"], "Description": [" Bronze lamp with an elongated body and a long splayed and fluked nozzle with an annular tip and a circular wick-hole. The dished upper surface is within a double rim around the body and nozzle. There are three-filling-holes with an incuse `stem' above, suggesting a bunch of grapes. At the rear is a curved handle of triangular section, terminating in a calyx with a serrated band, from which emerges the head of a hound or wolf; there are angular ridges at the handle-spring. The flat base follows the shape of the lamp.
