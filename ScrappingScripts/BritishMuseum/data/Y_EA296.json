{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA296"], "Description": [" Limestone niche statue of Maanakhtef: only his head, the fingers of his hands (held open in adoration), and the stela in front of him have been carved. Topped by a series of protective symbols, including two figures of the jackal god Anubis, the stela offers a prayer to the gods Amun and Atum, as manifestations, respectively, of the rising and setting sun, praying that they enable Maanakhtef to \"go forth as a living 'ba'\". All that can be seen of Maanakhtef's costume is his double wig, which, because the tresses and curls of hair are not indicated, looks more like a hood. The long, rather puffy-looking front lappets are in the style of the Nineteenth Dynasty. His round face and attractive but undistinguished features are based on representations of Ramses II. His earlobes are pierced for earrings. Traces of paint can be seen.

Almost certainly it faced east, and was thus in an ideal position to greet the sun each morning. Many New Kingdom tombs at Thebes had a small pyramid6 constructed above the chapel with a niche in the front (eastern) face. In it was placed a kneeling statue of the tomb owner, holding a stela with a prayer or hymn to the sun. Since these small pyramids were built structures, rather than rock-cut, these statues were separate, freestanding works, and many have survived. Maanakhtef's statue is of the same type, but the fact that it was carved as part of its niche suggests that it may have been positioned in a flat part of a rock-cut fa\u00e7ade, rather than in a pyramid.
