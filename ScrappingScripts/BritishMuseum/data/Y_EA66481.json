Depending on the identification of the bird, a goose or a duck, its translation can be either a cryptographic reading of the name of Amun-Ra, the goose being a sacred animal to him, or the motto 'Shu, son of Ra' (for both readings: Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 83-88, esp. the type 84 for this piece, found in two specimens in the Scarab Factory itself).
