It bears three rivet holes and an axial groove, enabling the tang of the blade to be inserted (the blade, which is made of a cuprous metal, has actually coloured the ivory green). At the base, two oval cavities were hollowed out, allowing a better grip. The side was chipped and was repaired using two tenons, one of which is still preserved."}
