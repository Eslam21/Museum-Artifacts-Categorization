The upper part of an askos modelled as an actor: a slave seated on an altar, the upper edge of which survives at the rear. His arms are crossed on his chest, the hands below the edge of the mask. He wears a long-sleeved garment under a short-sleeved tunic, and probably trousers. The undergarment, except for the sleeves, is mottled to indicate fur, and is tied above the belly, with tassels hanging down. A himation is wrapped round, high at the waist behind and covering the buttocks, pulled tight and exposing his left thigh. A low vessel-mouth, damaged, rises from the top of the head and a short spout emerges from between his shoulders. Hollow; two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with some white grits with an overall black slip: Memphis Black Ware.
