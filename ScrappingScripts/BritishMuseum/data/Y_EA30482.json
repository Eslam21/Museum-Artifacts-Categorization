{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA30482"], "Description": [" Gold amulet: composed of a gold flat fish with a semi-translucent quartz inlay body. The base-plate, body and fins have been cut from a single piece of sheet metal. The tail was added separately, perhaps after it originally broke off. The body consists of a cloison made from a strip of foil soldered at right angles to the base-plate; the solder is visible. The cloison thus formed is inlaid with an oval piece of quartz which is broken across at the widest point (the head) and has a chip in the tail-piece. To the front of the base-plate is soldered a ring scored with three lines. The obverse of the fins and tail is scored with lines radiating from the body.
