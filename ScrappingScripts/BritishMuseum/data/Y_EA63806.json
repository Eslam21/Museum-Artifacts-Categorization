{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA63806"], "Description": [" Fragmentary head of a limestone male figure. The surviving portion of the wig is smooth and tucked behind his ears. His thin eyebrows are carved in raised relief and slope far down towards the temples. His eyes are large and almond shaped, with slim incised eyelids and a short pointed cosmetic line. There are faint traces of black paint within the eyes. His nose is broad, and his lips are thick and curved into a gentle smile. His face is rounded and fleshy at the mouth and jawline. There is damage to the sides of the wig underneath the ears, and small chips are visible across the face particularly at the right side cheek. The object is now supported by a modern mount.
