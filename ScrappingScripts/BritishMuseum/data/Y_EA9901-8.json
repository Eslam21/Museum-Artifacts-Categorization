Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Sheet composed of 30 lines of black and red cursive hieroglyphic text with black dividing lines. Above the text is a polychrome vignette in a band at the top, separated by black/yellow lines. Spell 17. Vignette depicts seven seated figures holding knives, one of which is seated in a booth; the deceased worshipping five seated deities; a cat slaying a snake by a tree. Black cursive hieroglyphic captions identify the deceased and the deities; Ra, Shu, Tefnut, Geb and Ba-Djedet (ba of Mendes). Framed by black/yellow lines.
