{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1905,1021.3"], "Description": [" Plaster head of Aphrodite. A plaster head and neck of Aphrodite, with wavy hair parted in the centre and drawn back into a bun at the nape of the neck. She wears a bejewelled diadem and ball earrings; the head is inclined to the left. Summary treatment at the back, with the bun largely flattened. The head was modelled separately, the front at least made in a mould, and was attached to the body with a spike of plaster. White plaster, with a worn grey paint over much of the front surface, on the hair, diadem and face; some indeterminate black areas may be staining rather than a paint.
