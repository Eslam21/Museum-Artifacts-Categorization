The flat underside bears a motif of a lion striding over two plants. The style of the scarab top, and the dashes incised within the area of the lion are features of early 2nd Intermediate Period (18th-17th century BC) scarabs. At this date the scarab form was still being used as a seal for documents and commodity containers, whereas later it was used only in its other function as a talisman."}
