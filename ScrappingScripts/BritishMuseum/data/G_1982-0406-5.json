A flask in the form of a fat naked female being with legs wide apart to expose her genitals: her left leg is raised high, the right bent with the foot on the ground; she indicates her pubic area with her right hand. There is no trace of her left hand, which would have supported her left leg. Her hair is parted in the centre and tresses fall on her shoulders; she wears a tightly bound wreath, above which the slightly flaring mouth of the flask rises. She wears an armlet on her upper right arm. There is apparently a narrow belt knotted round her waist and there are indications that she wore a ribbon running diagonally from her right shoulder between her breasts: other examples have such a ribbon or body-chain. A ring-handle runs from her left knee to the side of her head. The figure is supported on a flat-fronted plinth decorated with a simple vine-scroll. The back is plain. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous dark-grey Nile silt with a black slip overall: Memphis Black Ware.
