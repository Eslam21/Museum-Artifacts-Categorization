{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.12"], "Description": [" Head of terracotta female figure. A woman's head broken from a figure; the hair is arranged in the melon style, with a deep central parting, drawn back to a large ring-shaped bun. Mould-made, with much hand-tooling; the bun has been added, and the join between the head and the neck is noticeable: the neck was probably made separately to affix the head to the lost body. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with minute traces of a white dressing; traces of pink paint remain in the join between the head and the neck.
