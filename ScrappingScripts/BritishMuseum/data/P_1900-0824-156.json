There are minor modifications to the composition such as the movement of the temple towards the left. It appears to have been made after the painting was dispatched to Antwerp through a combination of Claude\u2019s Liber Veritiatis, preparatory drawings and recollection from memory. The inscription of 1658 would therefore be incorrect, and so Roethlisberger argued that it should read 1668, on account of the hanlding which he saw to be more similar to works from the mid 1660s. This tcchnique is apparent in the light layers of wash in varying tones of grey and brown, and a restrained use of white heightening. The purpose for which this drawing was produced is unclear, as its level of finish suggests that it may have been meant as a finished work in its own right. Lit.: A.M.
