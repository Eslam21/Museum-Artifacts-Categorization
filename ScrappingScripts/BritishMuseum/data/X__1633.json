", " Solid handmade simple horse figurines are common in the Archaic and Cypro-Archaic periods of Greece and Cyprus. Simple hand-made rider figurines were made in the Nile Delta of Egypt during the Late Period and found in Naukratis (British Museum GR1886,0401.1468; Higgins 1954, 407; GR1973,0501.18; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA599; Bristol Museum, H2223; Bolton Museum, 1966.93), Toukh el Karenis (Cairo Museum TR14/1/34/5= SR5/1744), unprovenanced (Cairo Museum TR14/1/ 34/6=SR5/1849; CG32901=SR5/ 1835). They were possibly copying 'Persian rider' types (see British Museum GR1888,0601.90) or Cypriot or Greek types. This may have had a rider. The fine fabric resembles that of some Egyptian Nile silt pieces, but most like some East Greek pieces from Naukratis. GR2011,5009.290 to GR2011,5009.295 are all in the same style, but come from more than one example. Parallels from Halicarnassus dated to the 6th century BC (Higgins 1970, nos 301-323).
