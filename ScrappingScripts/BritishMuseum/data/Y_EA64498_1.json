She wears a wig topped with a tall ostrich feather. The small figure is simply modelled and lacks much detail; the limbs are undifferentiated and the detail on the feather is roughly sketched in uneven incised lines. There is a small amount of corrosion on the tang and the back of the figure.

Bronze figures of deities could stand alone or be part of a group composition; the small size of this figure and the tang suggest that it was probably part of a larger arrangement. Maat was the deified personification of the ancient Egyptian concept of order, balance, truth, and justice. Generally depicted as a goddess wearing an ostrich feather on her head, she was closely associated with the king, whose duty it was to maintain order in Egypt.
