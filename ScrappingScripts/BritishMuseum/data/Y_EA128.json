Below are five horizontal lines of text containing a standard, late funerary formula and a representation of the deceased standing with staff and sceptre, receiving an offering of a haunch from his son the lector-priest Mdw (or \u1e24mw). The whole is carved in rather rough sunk relief. The name of the deceased which is written, apparently, at the end of the long vertical line of text on the right, is by no means certainly of the form given above.
