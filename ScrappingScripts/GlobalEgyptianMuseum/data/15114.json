He wears the traditional Egyptian headdress, the Nemes, decorated with the uraeus, or royal cobra, protector of the pharaoh. Tuthmosis the Third is shown with a nude torso, wearing the Usekh collar and the Shendyt royal kilt. His hands are flat on his knees and his name is inscribed in the royal cartouche on his belt. On the sides of his legs, two columns of hieroglyphs give his names and titles. The two sides of the throne were decorated with the Sema-Tawy, sign of the unity of the two lands, now almost missing except for part of the papyrus plant. In this statue, the features of King Tuthmosis the Third look like those of Queen Hatshepsut, his predecessor."}
