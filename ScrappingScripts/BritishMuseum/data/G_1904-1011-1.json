{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1904,1011.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Artemis. A figure of Artemis standing, modelled in the round, the head and lower legs lost, together with much of her arms. She wears a short chiton with overfall, and a himation rolled and hitched round her waist, the ends falling on her right side. A quiver is carried behind her right shoulder. She is hollow and was produced basically in a two-piece mould, much of the arms being made separately and joined to the stumps with collars of plaster: the right arm was raised and its stump has a finished end; the left arm was lowered and part of the added portion survives with its plaster collar intact. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt with a brown core, covered overall with a white dressing: it covered the finished end of the stump of the right arm, and was thus applied before the arms were added. The flesh was painted pink, traces of which survive in the V of her dress, on the arms and on the legs below the chiton. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Roman (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)

Only terracottas and a couple of lamps seem to be published from this house; some are Ptolemaic, as is the Harpokrates (ibid.: pl. xlvi:30, and possibly some of those illustrated on pls xlviii:57\u201360 and li:114). Others are of the second century ad, as are the beneficent demons (ibid.: pl. xlix:89\u201391) and the two lamps (ibid.: pls liv\u2013lv:D 12k and D 92). Our Artemis is very probably Ptolemaic.
