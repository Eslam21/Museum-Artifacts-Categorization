{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 69408", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "11.7 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of a Scene from Daily Life", "Description": "This charming sketch shows a scene of daily life. It is a simple depiction of an adult, standing and extending his right hand, perhaps to pluck a leaf from the tree in the center of the sketch. His other hand holds a staff to drive a goat away as it feeds from the tree. The goat stands on its hind legs to allow its young to suckle easily. Because these elements are rarely depicted together in ancient tombs, this sketch might have been used as an ornamental scene to decorate houses rather than tombs."}
