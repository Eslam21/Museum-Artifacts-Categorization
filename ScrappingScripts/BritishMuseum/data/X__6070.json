", " Described as a fragmentary circular pottery bread stamp, however a large number of similar artefacts have been found in Naukratis and many have preserved plaster in the grooves, as if used to seal amphorae stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374) as with this example. This example, published by Petrie (1886, pl. xxix) was used to produce terracotta discs, and not on bread, as confirmed by the presence of its cast (likely a stopper) in Munich (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964).
