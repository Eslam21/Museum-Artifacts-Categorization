XXXVIII, no. 190; Petrie 1889, pl. 61, no. 1957). The name of Menkheperra appears on a wide range of scarabs and scaraboids, and, does not necessarily refer to Thutmosis III: it was also a popular motto associated with the god Amun-Ra (Jaeger 1982, see notably 92, \u00a7 403 for this specific motif and numerous parallels). A similar scarab was discovered in Naukratis by Hogarth in 1899: Cairo, Egyptian Museum CG37371. Jaeger, B. 1982. Essai de classification et datation des scarab\u00e9es Menkh\u00e9perr\u00ea.
