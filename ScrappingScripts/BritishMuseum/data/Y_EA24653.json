{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA24653"], "Description": [" A pottery flask in the shape of a scribe with the right leg raised. The left foot hooks around the right ankle. Although his back is straight and his head lifted as though he awaits dictation, the scribe appears relaxed, leaning slightly to the left as one might expect with the legs in this position. He is writing with his right hand, while his left originally held the papyrus roll. He wears a kilt, on the surface of which he has unrolled a papyrus. The spout is an organic part of the head, while on most figure vases it seems like an afterthought. This scribe flask is also unusual in having no handle.

Instead it belongs to a type of decorative vessel shaped into figures of servants, most often women nursing children. This example is unparalleled. Bibliography: E.A.W. Budge, E. A.
