Perhaps, as royal scribe, it was Hunefer himself who put brush to ink to inscribe his own papyrus. Sheet split into two sections; divided by double black/yellow line. Spell 17 continued, with extra vignette and prayer. Left-hand side contains a polychrome vignette of deceased standing with his wife in an adoration pose. Above the figures are short lines of black cursive hieroglyphic text with black dividing lines and black cursive hieroglyphic captions are also found beside each figure. Right-hand side is composed of 27 columns of cursive hieroglyphic text written in black and red ink with black dividing lines. Above the columns is a polychrome vignette in a band at the top. Vignette depicts two kneeling images of deceased, one of which kneels before a tomb which is flanked by the four Sons of Horus; Mehet-weret sitting on a shrine as Thoth offers a wedjat-eye; four sitting figures, one of which sits within a booth. There are small black cursive hieroglyphic captions by the images of the deceased and the four Sons of Horus. Framed by black lines. Composition fills sheet; bordered on top and bottom with red and yellow line. Very little text/image loss except for yellow paint which has faded. Bibliography: W.
