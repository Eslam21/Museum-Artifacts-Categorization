", " Horn brail ring, originally attached to an ancient sail as a fairlead for the brail lines used to adjust the sail. The two examples from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford AN1896-1908-E.3677B and AN1896-1908-E.3677A) were excavated in 1903 by Hogarth and may have been discovered in the Hellenion, though this is not certain. Both examples are complete except for significant wear around their attachment to the sail. It is not certain whether the rings were drilled when first created, though wear suggests that they were used until the attached part was worn thin (or worn through with this example) by the friction of attachment to the sail cloth and rope. Whilst horn brail rings are well known from the Roman (and Ptolemaic) Red sea ports of Egypt (Blue et al 2011), these are larger and of a different construction than those. If these were indeed of Archaic or Classical Greek date, these would be the oldest known examples of Brail rings in this material. Brail rings are known in other materials (including lead, copper alloy, wood and stone) from shipwrecks of Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine date (Parker 1992). Parallels from Perachora, may also be brail rings (Payne 1962, 441, pl. 187, nos. A285, A286, A287). If so they are probably of 7th or 6th century BC date, but represent three different sizes, including small (6.6cm diam.) aand larger (but fragmentary). Blue, L, Whitewright, R. J. and Thomas, R. I.
