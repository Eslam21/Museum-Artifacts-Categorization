{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA59850"], "Description": [" Glazed composition finger-ring: this ring is made from bright blue glazed composition in the shape of an openwork wedding band in which a column of five figures of the god Bes stands on each other's heads. As usual, he is depicted full-faced with very leonine features, naked and dwarf-like with bandy legs; in one instance the legs are most unexpectedly in profile. Only two of the figures wear his customary tall plumes; little more than a 'modius' is worn by the three other figures. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (?) ", " Third Intermediate (?)
