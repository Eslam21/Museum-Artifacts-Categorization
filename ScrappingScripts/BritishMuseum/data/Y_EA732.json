{"artifact_name": "relief", "Object Type": ["relief"], "Museum number": ["EA732"], "Description": [" Limestone relief fragment of a battle scene with defeated Asians: the fragment was part of a large composition depicting the siege of a walled Near Eastern city. The edge of the Egyptian siege ladder can be seen along the right edge of this fragment. The men fall from the ramparts to their death, pierced with Egyptian arrows. The skin of the foreigners is painted yellow, primarily to indicate that they were lighter complexioned than the Egyptians. The red hair on the head of the figure falling feet downward also indicates a people fairer in both hair and skin than most Egyptians. The painted designs on the kilts are very faded, but we can still see their variety.
