The character of the glaze finds parallels in Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) type 5 and Type 9 cups. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18).
