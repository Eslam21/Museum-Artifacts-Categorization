XXXVIII, no. 167). The scarab belongs to Gorton type XII, a type especially well- distributed on Punic sites, but present also in Greece, Cyprus and in Naukratis in Egypt (Gorton 1996, 34-38, type XII). According to the examples discovered in good contexts, this type is attested from around 800 BC till 700 BC (Gorton 1996, 37). It could be one of these early scarabs discovered at Naukratis.
