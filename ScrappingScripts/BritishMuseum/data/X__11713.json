Resembles Cypriot Archaic (6th to 5th century BC) style figures from Naukratis at the British Museum (GR 1911,0606.2, GR 1888,0601.92). See also NA625 and NA626 in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology. 'Early Archaic' parallel from Lindos (Blinkenberg 1931, pl.84, no.1899). The form and the decoration look Archaic Greek in style. Stags are a rare subject for Cypriot terracottas, but present from the Geometric period onwards. This fits with an example from Tamassos dated to the Cypro-Archaic period (Karageorghis 1996, Fitzwilliam GR.230-1892. Stag pl.23.5 M3), probably Cypro-Archaic II period. A stag figure is also known from temple of Apollo at Kourion (Karageorghis 1996, 39). This figurine is labelled in pencil T over a second line reading \u03a618 (however the second and third characters are obscured and unclear), designating this as coming from a context excavated by Petrie within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, during Gardner\u2019s excavations at Naukratis in 1885-1886.
