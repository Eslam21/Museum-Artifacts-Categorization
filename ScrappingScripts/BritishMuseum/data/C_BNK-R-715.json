However, since he also appears on Caracalla's coinage earlier in the reign, and given Severus' professed enthusiasm for the god, it was probably also a family devotion. Serapis was a syncretic god created in Ptolemaic Egypt and was designed to be inclusive to both Greeks and Egyptians by containing attributes of other gods such as Osiris, Zeus, Hades, and Asklepios."], "Bibliographic references": [" RE5 / Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum, vol.V: Pertinax to Elagabalus (187, p.464) ", " RIC4 / The Roman imperial coinage, vol. 4: Pertinax - Uranius Antonius (289e, p.255) (var.)
