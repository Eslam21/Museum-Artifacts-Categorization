The upper part of the ornament is a crescentic plaque with a symmetrical series of volutes below, formed of repousse-gold sheet. An S-shaped hook is soldered to the back and the wire runs up to support a bead within the horns of the crescent. Hanging from three loops, which are attached behind the volutes, are wires covered by narrow cones of sheet gold, and terminating in beads. The bead within the crescent is made of hollow glass. The other beads appear to be pearls.
