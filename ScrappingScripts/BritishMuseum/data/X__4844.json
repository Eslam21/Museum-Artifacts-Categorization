On the right earlobe and the neck three lines of red spots placed above one another. Yellow on the right lower lid, the chin and the left cheek.The head, with the broad area of the cheeks, thins towards the high calvarium creating a pear-like shape.

", " With its facial contours broadening towards the chin and its slimmest point approximately around the temples, the large ears and the not closely fitted headscarf, this head is comparable to statuette London BM B456 (Nick 2006, cat. 30), which belongs into the first quarter of the sixth century BC. It also shows similarities with Nick 2006, cat.1. Published (M\u00f6ller 2000, 158; Nick 2006, 120-1, 66, cat. 45, pl. 20). The heavy, Egyptianizing features of the face and the long, stylized ear place this head in a well-defined group. An only slightly less evolved head in the same style occurs on an unpublished male figure in a context of the late seventh century B.C. at Old Smyrna. Closely comparable also are some of the limestone fluteplayer statuettes of the ' mixed style' and some pieces of Egyptianizing faience of approximately late seventh-century date from Rhodes.
