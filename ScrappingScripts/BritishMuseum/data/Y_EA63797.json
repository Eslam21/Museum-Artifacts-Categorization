{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA63797"], "Description": [" Turquoise glazed composition seated figure of Isis and Harpocrates: the workmanship is fine and detailed. The rich turquoise colour of the glaze has been offset by a purplish colouring applied to the wig of Isis. The goddess wears on her head the image of a seat or throne (the hieroglyphic sign for her name). She clasps her right breast with one hand and with the other supports the head of her son to suckle him. Harpocrates sits passively on his mother's knee; his head is shaven but for the curled sidelock of hair, denoting his youthfulness. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 30th Dynasty (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
