{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Description": [" Mould-made amulet in glazed composition; unidentified theme; very schematic and crude design; pale blue glaze very eroded; whitish core; seems complete. Boston records suggest that this amulet 'appears to be a jackal headed deity. Flat fronted body. Column at the back & flat plinth. Slightest traces of blue gree, mostly rough white. Hole through the shoulders'. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " 26th Dynasty (?)

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too. The absence of canine ears on the top of the amuletic figure probably indicates that this is not a jackal- headed deity.
