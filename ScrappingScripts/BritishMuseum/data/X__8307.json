", " Discoid weights are not that commonly found in Egypt in general, though they do appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 2, fig. 13 and fig. 26). They are usually of small size and mass, and, made out of igneous rock such as basalt, granite and diorite, like this specimen. They do also occur regularly in bronze, notably in the Naukratis collection. These weights can be generally associated to the most used standard in Naukratis, the Egyptian standard kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples (Petrie 1926, 14; Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 25). However a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). This specimen corresponds to 2 kedets.
