", " Dome-shaped (or \"cupcake-shaped\") weights are the most common type found in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII, \u201cdomed\u201d type), but also elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 4, fig. 13) and in the Near East (Birney and Levine 2011, 474). Bronze weights of this type seem, however, to be more often found on Phoenician sites (Kletter 1994, 36-37). In Naukratis, they are all small-sized, rather light, and are associated with various standards. This specimen corresponds to 2 kedets.
