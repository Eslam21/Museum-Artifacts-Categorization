{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA41644"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone female figure, the lower body and base now lost. The figure is depicted with a large and heavy wig, with a lotus stem placed along the top of the head and the flower extending above the forehead. Across the wig is a patterned fillet band. Her eyes are wide, sharply incised and almond shaped with deep arched ridges indicating the eyebrows. The nose is slim with broadened nostrils, and the mouth is full with thick lips which are upturned at the corners. The ridge of the lower lip is sharply incised, and there are traces of a cupid\u2019s bow above the top lip. She wears a beaded broad collar composed of various strands, and the remains of a tight-fitting sheath dress is delineated with tight ripples across the clothing at the breasts and left side of the waist. Traces of a knot are visible under the right breast, and the rippled texture of the material continues in wider gaps along the upper left arm. The left arm appears to have been held close to the body. On the reverse are the remains of a back-pillar inscribed with three columns of text, the upper and lower portion of the text now missing. In addition to the loss of the lower body, part of the left side of the body from the edges of the wig to the lower arm and torso area are also lost. The edges of the back-pillar on the reverse are severely damaged.
