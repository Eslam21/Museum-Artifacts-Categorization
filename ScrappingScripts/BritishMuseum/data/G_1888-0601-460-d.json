The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed.However unlike other sherds by the Naukratis Painter, here the exterior decoration is mostly in outline and the interior decoration is sparse. The thickness of the sherd suggests that it belongs to a thick-walled chalice or heavy chalice"], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
