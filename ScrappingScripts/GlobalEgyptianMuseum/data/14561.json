He is completely enveloped in a cloak; only his hands and feet can be seen. He holds in his hands the signs of power and prosperity. On the body there are six lines in low relief, specifying his names and titles and those of his predecessors, together with prayers to the gods. There are also three columns of hieroglyphs on the back pillar. Djedkhonsu-Iwf-Ankh's wig is decorated in vertical lines descending from the top of the head into simple horizontal curls that leave the ears exposed. The soft face reveals the relaxed personality of the priest, who is portrayed with half-closed eyes. The base contains an offering formula for Amun-Re."}
