{"artifact_name": "capital", "Object Type": ["capital"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.22"], "Description": [" Fragment of a limestone moulding from the upper part of column drum/ column capital. The evenly cut side of the astragal- placed opposite the edges of the flutes and which could have been top or bottom side of the column \u2013 merges after 4,8 cm into a 2 cm wider and 3 cm higher beading which interfered with the underside of the astragal. Thus it was integrated into the next architectural element by means of a disc of 3.2cm. The evenly cut side of the astragal- pleaced opposite the edges of the flutes and which could have been top or bottom side of the column - merges into a 2cm wider and 3cm higher beading which interfered with the underside of the astragal. The stout astragal measures approximately 7cm in height; the column consisted of 20 flutes. The light limestone with small holes is crudely worked and lacks the final polish with the surface not fully rounded and grooves showing working marks. On the relief ground and at the top of the astragal traces of red paint are visible.

This fragment belongs to the same part of a column as B396a and c; the technique, however, marks this one and B396c as belonging to a different column with a varied design from B396a. The evenly cut side of the astragal, which lies opposite the fluting and could have been the top or bottom of the column, is continued in this fragment, as well as B396c, by a 2cm broader and 3 cm higher beading, which interfered with the underside of the astragal. The three fragments differ in the number of flutes calculated for the entire column but resemble each other closely in the calculations for the diameter, approximately 43.5cm for each of them, for the axes of the ornaments, approximately 7.5-7.6cm for each, and in the assumption of 18 axes. The column of which this fragment and B396c were parts had 20 flutes. Its shallow surface was only 11,1-2 cm high and the stout astragal measured approximately 7 cm in height (Koenigs 2007, 316-317).
