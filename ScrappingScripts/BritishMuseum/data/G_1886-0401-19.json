Thus they come from at least two different architectural elements. Moreover, the profile of the cross-section of this fragment is 1 cm higher than B 397b and also the bridge on the under differs. In plan view this fragment does not correspond very closely with fragments B397a and B397c (Koenigs 2007, 317-318). Published (Koenigs 2007, 317f.
