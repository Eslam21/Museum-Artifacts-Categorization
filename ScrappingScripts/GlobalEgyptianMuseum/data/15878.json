{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 26213", "Dating": "SETHOS I/MENMAATRE", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Mummy of Seti the First", "Description": "The mummy of Seti the First was buried in an elegant alabaster coffin in his tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was later moved to the Deir el-Bahari cache. Although the mummy's skull was separated from the body by tomb-robbers, the head is still well preserved; the body, however, is in poor condition. An X-ray reveals that the left side of his chest was stuffed with hard black masses of resin-impregnated linen and the king still wears an amulet on his left arm. The mummy's skin was brown when it was first uncovered in AD 1886."}
