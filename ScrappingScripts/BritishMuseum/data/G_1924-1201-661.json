The decoration on either side of Simple Animal Style vases is not usually extensive and filling ornament, with the exception of a simple rim pattern, a single elaborate rosette and simple handle zone pattern, is absent. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well.
