The statuette is a portrait of the king in which grace and grandeur are mixed. The sensitive face is framed by the short, round, thick wig decorated at the front with the uraeus, or royal cobra. The narrow slits of the eyes are partly veiled by lowered lids. They are set below protruding eyebrows that follow the curve of the eyes. The mouth is full with slightly upturned corners. The king is shown standing with both arms by his sides. He is dressed in a full ceremonial tunic that is delicately pleated to fan out from a visible knot. An artist with admirable talent was able to depict the delicate details of the king's facial features as well as the pleated dress, despite the hardness of the granite from which the statue was carved."}
