{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA63631"], "Description": [" Limestone trial-piece with Head of Akhenaten: on the smooth front of this irregular piece of stone is depicted the head, neck, and shoulders of a royal person. The short, pointed wig and the uraeus cobra on the forehead would identify it as King Akhenaten or his main queen, Nefertiti, although it is most likely Akhenaten himself whose withdrawn but benign face appears on this stone. The piece is clearly not a fragment broken off from a larger relief but a small work in its own right. This stone, although of uneven shape, is undoubtedly a masterpiece.
