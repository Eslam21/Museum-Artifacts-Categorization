This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The sherd is also published in Corbett and Woodhead, 'A forger of graffiti', ABSA 59 (1955) 261, no. 24 and the graffito is identified by the authors as a modern forgery. They argue that the graffiti were probably made in Athens as they bear strong similarities with a number of other forgeries there. The sherd was found presumably at Naukratis during Hogarth's excavations in 1899. Prior to his work there, Hogarth had worked in the British School at Athens in 1886-1888 and was the Director of the school between 1897 and 1900. Edgar, who published the catalogue of sherds from Hogarth's excavations at Naukratis, was also at the school in Athens between 1895 and 1898. Corbett and Woodhead suggest that one of the two may have acquired the sherd in Athens and accidentally kept it.
