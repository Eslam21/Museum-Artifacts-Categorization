{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 3243", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "MARBLE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "32 cm", "Name": "Marble Head, Possibly of Julius Caesar", "Description": "The white marble head possibly depicts Julius Caesar or an elderly man, perhaps a priest, wearing a rolled band.This head had been identified as a portrait of Caesar, but it bears little resemblance to Caesar's portraits or even portraits of individuals who copied Caesar's style. Instead, the features are taken from portraits of Egyptian officials. However, the straight mouth suggests a Roman rather than Ptolemaic setting. The subject is a thin man with a wrinkled face and sagging cheeks."}
