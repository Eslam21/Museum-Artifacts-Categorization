", " Bronze figures of Apis were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods, principally in the Memphite region where his main cult centre was situated, with only a few attestations on other Delta sites such as Bubastis and Herakleion (Roeder 1956, \u00a7 411-413; Weiss 2012, 293-295). This bull figure walking on a base belongs to the type T 28 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 293-294, 758-779, Pl. 47, Typ T 28). The base of this type of figure is usually mounted on a further base in the form of sledge (Weiss 2012, 294), whereas our specimen, much smaller and worn as a pendant, is directly represented on a sledge. Other figures of bull are known from Naukratis: BM 1885,1101.106; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.260 and 86.300.
