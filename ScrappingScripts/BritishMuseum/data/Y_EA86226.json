{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86226"], "Description": [" Scarab, made of glazed steatite (?), the base is partly worn. The scarab is of a beige colour, few traces of a possible white glazing preserved. The division between head and prothorax is slightly indicated by two short horizontal lines at the sites. Prothorax and elytra are divided by a single line that is bent downwards. The suture is shown by a single line as well. The area between the lower end of the elytra and the hind legs is carved out which seems rather unusual among the material present. The head is of an almost oval shape, no eyes are visible. A faint line separates the clypeus, which is shown without details. The side of the scarab shows three roughly carved legs on each side defined by three carved lines, the legs are without further details, the scarab is sitting on top of the baseplate. The seal at the base shows parts of an oval line framing the base, but it is not circumferential which is very unusual as well. Also the motif is weird, showing two nb-baskets on each longitudinal end which are hollowed out with small hatched lines inside, in the middle of the seal a spiral line, ending at the outer end of the scarab in a possible other nb-basked that is not hollowed out. The longitudinal perforation is fully preserved.
