Possibly from same vessel as 1965,0930.717 & 718. The association with 718 is very persuasive; (As)tu(k)ra(tes) may be the name of the dedicator; this would require a slight gap between the two sherds, which would fit both the rhythm of the maeander band and the graffito. By contrast the sequence ra.tu or ra--tu appears in only two names, with one appearance each. An objection may be that there is some difference in what is preserved, rather worn, of the decoration on the inside of the neck of 719."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GG.998)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.719"]}
