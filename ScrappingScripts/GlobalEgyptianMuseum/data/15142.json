Many bronze statues were found that depict him as an icon and emphasize his wisdom and divine nature. Figures such as this were considered to be able to transmit the everyday needs of ordinary people to the gods. This statue is one of those; it represents him seated with a papyrus scroll across his knees, a symbol of his wisdom. He is seated on a rectangular stool with a cornice, or projecting decoration, on the upper part. He wears a long priestly garment symbolizing his religious purity. The garment covers his body from chest to ankles. A ribbon extends beyond the garment and forms a shell. The head is shaven and the eyes are inlaid with silver; he wears a necklace. Hieroglyphic text is engraved around the base and his name is written at the front."}
