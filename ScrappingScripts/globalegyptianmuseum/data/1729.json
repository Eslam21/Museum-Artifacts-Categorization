The snake head appears as a funerary amulet to protect the deceased from serpent bites, a serious danger still in Egypt. In Egyptian art the snake is also used to represent the power protecting the sun-god against enemies, in the form of the 'uraeus' or rising cobra. Carnelian is the favoured material for these amulets, which featured in the regular sets of emblems protecting the deceased in Late Period mummification."}
