{"artifact_name": "human mummy; mummy-case; cartonnage; burial-cloth; mummy-wrapping", "Object Type": [" human mummy ", " mummy-case ", " cartonnage ", " burial-cloth ", " mummy-wrapping "], "Museum number": ["EA21809"], "Description": [" Mummy of an infant, sex uncertain. Skull - No details are observable owing to the resin and plaster casing. Thorax and Abdomen - Owing to the tightness of the wrappings all the ribs have been dislocated at their costo-vertebral articulations, but apparently not fractured. The spinal column shows numerous subluxations. There seems to be packing material in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The pelvis is dislocated. Arms - Extended, but dislocated at the elbows. the hands are almost certainly in contact with the outer aspects of the thighs. Legs - No obvious fractures. Scans reveal areas of unusually high density within the bone of both legs. This may be an indication that the child suffered from a bone tumor, but it is also possible that the variable density was caused by molten resin penetrating the bones during mummification. The sex is uncertain, but apparently of a boy, enclosed in a polychrome painted body-case of linen, plaster and resin, overlaid with a decorated burial-cloth. The tempera portrait, surrounded by a layer of wrappings, shows the child dressed in a whitish tunic and wearing a red ribbon around the neck. This was probably attached to an amulet, now lost. The face is painted pink, with darker pink and ochre applied as highlights.The rest of the body is covered by a painted shroud, adorned with rows of stucco studs, and with bandages arranged in a geometrical pattern over the feet. On the breast is an image of Nut, whose wings are outspread above falcon-headed and ram-headed sphinxes. At the sides in the four compartments below are scenes of ritual, in each of which a figure in priestly costume officiates before one or more deities. The first pair of gods are obscured by the mummy wrappings, but below is (left) a priest holding a libation jar before the falcon-headed sun god and a figure wearing the double crown, probably Atum. On the right another priest recites from a papyrus scroll before Osiris. In the lower panels incense is burned and libations offered to the enthroned Osiris (left) and Ra-Horakhty (right), who is protected by the winged arms of Isis and Nephthys respectively. These scenes are arranged on each side of a central band which was intended to receive an inscription, but was in fact left blank.
