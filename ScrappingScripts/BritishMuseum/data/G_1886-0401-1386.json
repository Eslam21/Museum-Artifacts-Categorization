{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1386"], "Description": [" Dark grey limestone standing figure of a veiled woman holding a cup, painted. The feet are broken away. She is wearing a dress whose hemline and collar are indicated in red paint, the necklace of three rows is only painted in red as well. The shoulders are hanging down; the elongated right arm is hanging rigidly at the side, the fingers pointing downwards; the left arm is bent, the hand is holding a cup between the pointy breasts. The veil is drawn back in a plain mass on to the shoulders, it is separated sharply from the forehead in a horizontal line, falling more smoothly and rounded behind the ears. The face is slim, the chin pointed; the nose is fairly long, the mouth is small with the edges turned downward. The protruding eyes have a straight lower lid and are framed by flat eyebrows. The head is inclined forward and is of a great depth. The body is entirely semi-columnar in section with the back sawn flat. The bottom of the skirt is arched. There is a trace of a transverse fold grooved under the left arm. On the wrists are painted red bracelets; the lips and ears were also red. There are traces of black paint on the hair, as well as on the eyeballs and eyelashes.

The sharp pointed features are paralleled on vase-paintings of the earlier phase of the \u2018Naukratite Chalice style.\u2019 The red paint over her chest may be the yoke of an Egyptian dress. Naukratis, I, pl. II. no. 1; Ohnefalsch-Richter, Kypros, Bible and Homer, pl. CCXIV, no. 1. ", " Nick (2006, p. 59) states that the figure belongs to Yon's type I, thus confirming the early date. She points out that the thrusting out of the deep head is an Egyptianising feature. ", " Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
