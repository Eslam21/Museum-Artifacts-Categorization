", " 'Saite-Greco-roman' in Liverpool records. ", " Several figures of Isis, including a 'bust of Isis' such as this specimen, were discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This figure could pertain to this hoard since it was discovered during the first season of excavation at Naukratis. The burnt traces on the figure support further this assertion because many finds from the cache bear such traces (Petrie 1886, 41). The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). The figure could pertain to the very common type Isis nursing Horus, type G12 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, Pl. 56). This type became very popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (for example: Grenier 2002, 51-58, pl. VIII-X; Goddio and Fabre 2008, 318-9 no. 178-180; Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314). Isis nursing is also a theme which is popular in other material in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b).
