{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 14109", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "LAMP", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Name": "Almond-Shaped Lamp with Bird", "Description": "This almond-shaped lamp has an ornament of a bird in a horizontal position. The bird's body is stretched over the body of the lamp. Its tail extends over the lamp's handle, while the wings extend over the sides. The bird's head is over the opening for the wick. The bird is a raised drawing. The opening for oil is in the middle. The tube for the wick represents part of the lamp's body. The many lamps found in Alexandria, inside or outside the tombs, are unique in style. If we look at the history of lamps found in Alexandria, we see that the early Greeks used them. Remains of lamps have been found dating from the Mycenaean era. Their use spread in Hellenistic times and a good number were discovered in tombs from the third century BC. Those lamps were made of gold, bronze, glass, and alabaster. However, burnt clay was the most commonly used material. In Roman times, interest in lamp ornamentation increased. They had various forms: vases, statues, small houses, or human and animal heads. They usually bore the seller's name, the number of hours of lighting for each lamp, or the maker's trademark and were stamped with the name of the maker. In the Christian era, the lamps carried raised drawings of heads of emperors or of animals, as well as various forms of crosses \"like the one before us.\" Some lamps bore Christian symbols, symbols of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the letters of his name. Many crosses and symbols of Christianity, such as flowers and doves, appear on the lamps."}
