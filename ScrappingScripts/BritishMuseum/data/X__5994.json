", " = EEF distribution list Philadelphia no. 18. ", " Several fittings made off copper alloy, sometimes with glass inlays like on this example, were discovered in Naukratis: they consist mainly in elements of crowns, but also false beards. Such fitting implies the presence of a relatively large statue of an Egyptian deity, probably life size or even larger statue in the case of this specimen (Masson forthcoming). Fittings in the shape of uraeus (single or pair) in copper alloy found in the Delta are listed in Weiss 2012, 876-880 (see esp. Nr. 1731 for this specimen).
