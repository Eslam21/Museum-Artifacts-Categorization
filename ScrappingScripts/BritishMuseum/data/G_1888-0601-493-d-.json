The painter and the group are named after the chalice found in the sanctuary of Aphaia at Aegina and vessels from this group display a thematic unity, all presenting figures in garments (normally the preserved lower parts of chiton and himation). None of the vessels in this group have any filling ornament and the interior decoration of some of the vessels consists of komasts rendered in the light on dark technique. For parallels regarding the subject matter, see Louvre E8056 bis.24. The depiction of the veiled female is reminiscent of the Chian plastic female heads. See Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA110 and British Museum 1886,0401.1218. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women.
