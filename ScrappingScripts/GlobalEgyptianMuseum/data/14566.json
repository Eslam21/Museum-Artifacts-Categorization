One is a white man, with a large part of his head missing, and the other is a black man, with all of his body missing except part of his head. The muscles on the body that remains are tight. The wrestler stands upright on the tips of his toes, trying to seize his opponent by the arm.A remarkable expression of intense concentration and resistance is shown on the other wrestler's face. A fountain behind the two wrestlers indicates that the site may be one of the public baths or a gymnasium.The mosaic is distinguished by its strong expression and the accurately chosen colors. It possibly was part of a wider image that was surrounded by a decorative ornament with the colors of the sea. The picture illustrates the lifestyle that prevailed in Alexandria during the first three centuries BC."}
