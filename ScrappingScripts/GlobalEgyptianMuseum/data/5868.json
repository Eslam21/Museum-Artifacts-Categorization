The upper body appears triangular. The left arm hangs straight down with the clenched hand drilled and containing a small cloth. The cloth appears as a small ridge next to the kilt. The right arm is curved and holds a flail. The legs are separated by a shallow furrow. The toes are indicated on the feet, which stand on a very low pedestal.
