{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.127"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of engraved and painted rock art on a limestone cave wall showing multiple incised vertical and horizontal lines forming cross-hatched patterns and a convergence in the lower centre of the image. At the top are many indentations in the rock surface forming unidentified angular shapes. It is unclear whether these are natural formations or finger marks. At the top right are the numerous faded remains of black markings (pigment?) and at the very top many rounded, honeycomb-grid-style formations. These are the remains of wasp\u2019s nests. The incised lines blend somewhat with multiple natural, close, vertical drip marks covering the rock surface. Wadi el-Obeiyd, Egypt.

The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave opens on the inside with a curved back wall and a domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with a circular rear wall. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " engraved rock art "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.127"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010035 (TARA number) "]}
