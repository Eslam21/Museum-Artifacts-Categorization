{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8475"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Djedher: there are four registers on this round-topped stela. The upper section is filled with a winged sun-disk with uraei. In the second section is a line of text with a prayer to Geb. There is a scene in the third register below a sky. The deceased stands on the right in worship before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. A libation is flowing from the vessel. On the other side of the altar stand Osiris, a winged Isis enfolding an 'wedjat'-eye, and the four sons of Horus standing two each on two lotus-blossoms. In the fourth register three lines of text contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Atum on behalf of the musician (?) of the house of Amun Djedhor, son of Ns-b\u0292-nb-d\u1e0f and the lady N\u02bf-ns-'lmn. The stela is slightly cracked on the surface and more severely damaged along the edges especially in the lower corners. A hole has been drilled at the top of the stela. The background of the stela appears to have been light brown. In the upper register the disk is red with green uraei each having a red disk on the head. The wings are divided into three sections below an upper green edge: white with red dots, green with a lower red edge, and blue with a lower red edge. The text between the uraei is black and that on each side red and green. The border here and between the other registers is composed of red, blue, white, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in red. The line of text in the second register is black. In the third register the sky is blue. The deceased has a red-brown body, black wig and features, and white and green kilt. The altar is blue edged in black, while the pot is red with a blue base possibly to indicate the level of water as the libation is shown as blue. The lotus has green leaves and a blue stem and flowers with a brown base. Osiris has a green body, buff collar, white and red crown, red face and hands, black beard, and blue sceptre. Isis has a green body, red dress, blue wig and head-dress, and red fillet. Her wings are divided into three sections: white with blue dots, green with a red edge, and blue with a red edge. She holds a green feather with a red edge. The 'wedjat'-eye is blue with a black pupil on white and a red band between eye and eyebrow above a green basket. Imsety has a green body, buff, gone white, collar, blue wig, red face, and black beard. Hapy has a red body, green (?) collar, blue wig, and red face. Duamutef has a green body, buff collar, blue wig, and green face, while Qebhsenuef has a red body, green collar, blue wig, and white face with black features. The lotus-flowers are blue with white tips and base, and green leaves and stem. The hieroglyphs in the fourth register are black between blue and red dividing lines.
