{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1455"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Bes. Bes standing on the capital block of a column, naked, with his hands on his thighs; he wears a feathered headdress. The shaft of the column is broken away below its base and it is impossible to tell how much is missing. The capital widens upwards and is undecorated, probably based on a papyrus capital. The back is plain and the crown is pierced at the top, perhaps to hold a stick of incense. Hollow, from a two-piece mould, with traces of a white dressing on the sides. Red-brown Nile silt with frequent fine gold mica and white inclusions.

Two examples from same mould series are known from Naukratis (Bristish Museum GR1886,0401.1455; Boston MFA 86.444;Walters 1903, C 594; Higgins 1954, no. 1546). The fabric is consistent with Nile Delta kiln products, probably from Naukratis. Similar Bes figures have been found in Ptolemaic contexts, or dated to the Roman period (Bailey 2008, 38; Fischer 1994, 257, Cat. 551; Dunand 1990, 42-3, Cat. 42-45). Dunand, F. 1990.
