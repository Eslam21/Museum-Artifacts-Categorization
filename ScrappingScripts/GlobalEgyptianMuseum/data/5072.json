{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "52", "Dating": "OSORKON I/SEKHEMKHEPERRE", "Provenance": "LOWER EGYPT", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BASALT", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "38 cm", "Width": "26.5 cm", "Name": "Sphinx of Osorkon I", "Description": "This sphinx once belonged to King Osorkon I, whose cartouche was carved seven times onto the body of the sphinx. The sphinx, resting on a base, has been rather coarsely sculpted. This seems to indicate that work on the sculpture was not completely finished. This is particularly noticeable in the facial features where the large eyes have only been outlined and the mouth only half finished mouth, as well as the hatching of the royal head-dress or Nemes. The face, with its large, protruding ears does not display any individual portrait characteristics but rather served to depict Osorkon I as an idealised godlike king. Numerous examples of this type of sculpture must have adorned one of the great temples."}
