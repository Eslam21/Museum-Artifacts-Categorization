They are sculpted from a cubic block, from which only the head emerges. The thighs are brought up to the chest and the arms are usually crossed on the knees. They were less expensive and more durable than other types of statuary.This block statue belonged to a person called Hor, who was a priest of Montu. It was consecrated to him in the domain of Karnak by his grandson, also called Hor. The dedication of this statue in the temple ensured that Hor would stay forever near the god of the temple and receive a part of the divine offerings."}
