{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "8186", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS ?", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "7.3 cm", "Width": "5.8 cm", "Depth": "5.1 cm", "Name": "Head of a male statue", "Description": "The break point of this small head with short echelon-curl wig occurs at the lower end of the neck; the tip of the nose is also missing. The face is not quite symmetrical: the right eye is set deeper, the left pupil protrudes more. The black wig frames the sides of the head to chin height. Because of the oblique break at the back of the head and the hunched up shoulders, it has to be assumed that this figure leant against a back plate."}
