{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1382"], "Description": [" Limestone statue of Ashamria: a kneeling stelophorous statue of the chief altar attendant of Amun Ashamria, in a long linen skirt and wig and sporting a short beard. The stela consists of one scene at the top and six lines of incised text. Ra-Horakhty is depicted in his barque, Horus at the rudder and Maat at the prow of the boat. A baboon is shown in an attitude of worship above the bark on either side. On the extreme right is a standard, and it and the bark rest on the sky-sign. The text consists of a prayer to Ra-Horakhty on behalf of Ashamria. A column of text is incised down the back-pillar and rear base of the statue containing the usual Hotep-di-nesu formula to Amun-Ra for the deceased. There are traces of blue paint in the hieroglyphs and figures and red paint in the dividing lines between the text.
