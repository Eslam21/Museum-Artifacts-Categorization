Assembled together: shoulder and body sherd of Milesian Fikellura pottery oinochoe with turn of neck; exterior: black neck; on shoulder, central panel decorated with scales representing breast feathers (purple on dots in every third row) with broad painted band on each side; oblique bars representing wing feathers, filled with dots. Assembled dimensions: h.: 7.5 cm; w.: 15 cm. The decoration seems to have been inspired by the conventional representation of a bird (partridge): scales for the breast feathers, bars for the folded wings (Cook). The breast-feather panel narrowing towards the bottom and the red on these feathers are unusual; the black bands are unusually wide. For a complete oinochoe with this decoration, see Walter-Karydi 1973, pl. 4, no. 47 (from Rhodes).
