The context (late 3rd to early 1st century BC), if correct, agrees with Bailey's dating of a parallel (2008, no. 3083; EA27333; see also T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 78). However, others date this type to the Roman period (Dunand 1990, nos 149-51). Dunand, F. 1990. Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. D\u00e9partement des antiquit\u00e9s \u00e9gyptiennes.
