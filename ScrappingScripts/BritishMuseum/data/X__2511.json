", " Oval convex plaques were mostly common during the Third Intermediate Period (Jaeger 1982, 206, \u00a7 1369). This specimen could be an oval-shaped button seal, which would mean a much earlier date, as such scaraboids were mainly produced between the Old and Middle Kingdom. The motif on the base is inspired from the classical motif of sema-tawy, symbolising the union of the two lands, and very common on First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom/Second Intermediate Period scarabs (Matouk 1977, 275; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 350, no. 811-2). The presence of such an early type of scaraboid in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). Another oval-shaped button seal decorated with a clump of papyrus on its underside was discovered in Naukratis: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.11.
