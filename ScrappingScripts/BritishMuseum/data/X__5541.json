This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Part of a small group of archaising Hellenistic or Classical Cypriot limestone figures brought to Naukratis (British Museum GR1900,0214.22; Amsterdam, Allard Pierson Museum 7835; Champaign, Spurlock Museum, University of Illinois 1926.02.0032; 1926.02.0029; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.3.1899 Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1886.457; AN1896-1908-G.1042; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H446.c). Naukratis parallel dated as 'probably archaizing work of late Hellenistic date or slightly later' (Budde & Nicholls 1967, no. 77/80, pl. 26). Context from register. A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum and Boston MFA registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Marked T in pencil. Budde, L. and Nicholls, R. 1967. Catalogue of the Greek and Roman sculpture in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
