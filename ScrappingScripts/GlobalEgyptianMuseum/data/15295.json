{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 37595", "Dating": "RAMESSES VIII/USERMAATRE-AKHENAMUN", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BASALT", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "39 cm", "Name": "Statue of Ramesses the Eighth Presenting Amun", "Description": "The statue of Ramesses the Eighth is an example of hasty workmanship. It lacks vigor. One of the few statues that survive from the Ramesside period, it demonstrates that the great era of creativity had ended. The face of the statue is heavy with a troubled expression devoid of interior strength. The wig, a vestige of Nineteenth Dynasty style, is composed of parallel stripes that form a kind of visor over the brow, which is adorned with the uraeus, or royal cobra. The wig falls in unusually long locks onto the collar bones, which are not marked. The widely pleated kilt is decorated with a heavy front panel. The god Amun holds the Was scepter, symbol of prosperity and well being, in his left hand and the Ankh, sign of life, in his right. The god's high headdress is only just recognizable and the pleats of his kilt have not been marked."}
