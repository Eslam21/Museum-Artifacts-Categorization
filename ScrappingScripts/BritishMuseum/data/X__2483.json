This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Identified possibly as a Nefertum figure, this amulet differs however from other Nefertum amulets found at Naukratis, which represent the deity standing, in a striding pose. Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and at Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217). Nefertum is relatively well represented in small amuletic figures from Naukratis, may they be in copper alloy, glazed composition or stone like for this specimen (Masson forthcoming). On amulets of Nefertum see: Andrews 1994, 18-19; Herrmann et al. 2010, 56 (type 24). The other possibility would be to identify this amulet with a representation of Amun-Ra. Since no other views of this amulet are available, it is difficult to decide between both identifications. Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
