The white sunk relief design is an Egyptianising scene which shows the following. At the top, a uraeus (sun disc) flanked by feathers, perhaps part of a continuous decorative band. Below this, a kneeling figure offers an Egyptian u-shaped wesekh collar (ceremonial collar), with one surviving floral terminal, to a deity. The right hand and wrist of the offrand are preserved, as are his knees, partly covered by a decorated skirt. He kneels on a step or platform in front of the god.
