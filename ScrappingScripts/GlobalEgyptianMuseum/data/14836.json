{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 61888", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "PECTORAL", "Material": "FELSPAR", "Technique": "CASTING; INLAID", "Name": "Pectoral of Tutankhamun with the Winged Scarab", "Description": "This beautiful pendant illustrates the throne name of King Tutankhamun, \"Neb- kheprew-re.\" The central element is the scarab \"Khepri\" made of a fine piece of lapis lazuli, and three strokes of plural \"sign in hieroglyphs\" below it. Between the forelegs of the scarab, the risen sun disk \"Re\" is depicted. It is made of a clear red carnelian set in gold, which represents what, in nature, was the ball of mud and dung containing its eggs that was rolled forward by the beetle. Beneath the plural strokes \"sign in hieroglyphs\" is a basket shape \"Neb\" inlaid with turquoise. The gold wings that are often added to the scarab represent Re, the god of the rising sun. They sweep round to form an almost complete circle, enveloping the royal name and offering it divine protection."}
