{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1574"], "Description": [" Stela of Mehu and his son Herib: the lower part of an unfinished stela. The surface still bears considerable traces of the black grid-lines used for laying out the inscribed area. The bodies of two men are shown, facing each other; on the right is that of Herib who raises both hands in an attitude of adoration. Below this figure is a short offering-text on Herib's behalf and in front the lower part of a vertical line of text which identifies him as the eldest [son] of the person represented on the left. A similar offering-text beneath the figure of this latter person gives his name, but unfortunately its reading is uncertain. The whole stela is carved in a very rough, unfinished, low relief. Red colour remains in most of the signs and there are traces of yellow on the kilt of the figure of Herib.
