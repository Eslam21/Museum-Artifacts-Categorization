Bailey warns that late 2nd or early 3rd century AD \u2018frog lamps\u2019 from Myos Hormos (Whitcomb & Johnson 1982, pl.60dd) and from el-Ashmunein (Bailey 1998, pl.87 X13), suggest these have also been made before the 3rd century AD. Similar lamps found in Mons Claudianus were undated, but like the majority of the material from the site, should date between 2nd and the early 3rd century AD (Knowles 2006, Type, nos. 52-57). 2nd to early 4th century AD parallel from Tell Atrib (M\u0142ynarczyk 2012, type TA III.2, see also type TA III.3).
