", " Probably made in Naukratis. Difficult to identify this small fragment. A Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no.69) or a Roman Harpocrates (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, Pl.41 no.69, 1st century AD; Bayeer Neimer 1988, Pl.11, no.58; Besques 1992, Pl.69, no.E369 from middle Egypt.), seems most likely. However, this also resembles some simple Roman forms of women (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, Pl.XCVLL No.178), though this seems less likely. Bayer-Niemeier, E. 1988. \u2018Liebieghaus Museum Alter Plastik.
