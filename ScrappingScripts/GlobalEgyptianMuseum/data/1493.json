It probably served in the making of plaques of metal, clay and plaster. Dating from the end of the 2nd century of our time, the Brussels mould represents on its six faces a horned altar, a bull kneeling on the ground, a walking bull, a pig,  \"Baubo\" and  cavalier Harpocrates. The series of scenes evokes the sacrifice offered in honour of \"Baubo\", divine being assimilated with Isis, on the occasion of the  visit which Harpocrates, her son, had just paid her.   "}
