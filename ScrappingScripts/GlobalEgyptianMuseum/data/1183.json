{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7049", "Dating": "PSAMMETICHUS I/WAHIBRE", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BASALT", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; ENGRAVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "36 cm", "Name": "The vizier Bakenrenef", "Description": "The statuette represents Bakenrenef, vizier of Psamtek I (664-619 BC) and priest of the Memphite deities Ptah and Sokar. He kneels, with his hands flat on his thighs in the age-old attitude of veneration. The idealised and powerful facial features point to the 25th Dynasty. The statue looks slightly upwards, a characteristic of exaltation. The statue bears several archaising indications, such as the round striated wig with a central lock of hair, indicating the vizier's membership of the priesthood of Ptah, and the heart amulet on his chest. This statue, recently put together from two fragments, is an excellent example of the archaising statuary of the Saite Period."}
