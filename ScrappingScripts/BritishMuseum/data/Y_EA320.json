{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA320"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Raweben: on the upper part of this round-topped stela appear representations in sunk relief accompanied by incised texts. Ra-Horakhty is seated on a throne on the left beneath a single-winged disk and before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. A figure on the right stands with raised arms in one of which he holds an offering. The text above him gives the name of \u1e32n-m-\u1e2bps.f, while two vertical lines on each side of the figures name Raweben and his son R\u02bf-ms. Three horizontal lines of text incised below the scene contain an invocation to Ra-Horakhty on behalf of the workman Raweben. A portion of the surface of the upper part of the stela is raised due to the unevenness of the stone. Traces of the original colour remain. The hieroglyphs were black with red lines between the columns. Traces of blue can be seen on the border of the stela. The bodies, pleats of the kilts and the sun-disk on the head of Ra-Horakhty are red, while the wig and individual features on the face of the standing figure are black. There are traces of blue and red on the throne, while the stem of the lotus is red and the altar edged in red.

His monuments include two offering-tables. Raweben is closely associated with the chiseller Ipuy, son of Piay, in tomb 210, but their relationship is never stated. On an offering-table in Turin he is described as a son of the draughtsman Pay, but this need not be taken literally. It is possible that this stela has been repaired and reused, as the single-winged disk is attested almost entirely in the Eighteenth Dynasty. Bibliography: J.
