This tenon is in the front left-hand corner of the upper surface, and is pierced by a single hole for fixing. In the left side of the leg is a small hole for a dowel. This leg belonged to the same object as 1899,0314.17, but was intended to be fixed on the opposite side, so that the positions of the tenon and dowel are reversed.
