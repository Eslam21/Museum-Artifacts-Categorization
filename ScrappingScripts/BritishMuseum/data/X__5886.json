", " In addition to this specimen, two models of processional staff were discovered in Naukratis (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.258 and 86.304). Both are surmounted by a raised uraeus (cobra). This finial might be connected to the local cult of the ram-headed god Amun-Ra Baded in Naukratis (on this cult, see for example: Guermeur 2005, 126-138). Similar staffs with ram's head finial in bronze were discovered in Athribis and Saqqara: BM 1971, 0123.21; Weiss 2012, 857-858, Pl 64 a-b (ram-headed aegids in bronze) and Pl 65 b-f (for various staff-finials in bronze). One of the ram's head finials was dated to the first half of the 4th century BC (Davies, Smith 2005, 93, pl. XLVI c).
