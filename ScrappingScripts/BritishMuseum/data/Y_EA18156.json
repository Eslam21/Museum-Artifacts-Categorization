{"artifact_name": "head-rest", "Object Type": ["head-rest"], "Museum number": ["EA18156"], "Description": [" Folding wooden headrest: the base and shaft have been replaced by two legs in the form of ducks' heads and necks that are pierced by a pivot so that the piece could be folded shut for easy storage and transportation. On this example, faces of Bes adorn both ends of the curved support, literally cradling the sleeper's head with divine protection. He is depicted with fully frontal face. His features are characteristically lion-like and he has lions' ears, a mane and a tall plumed headdress. His face has thick eyebrows and two flesh folds running along his cheeks, and he sticks his tongue out cheekily. The legs are riveted and where they cross at their ends duck heads grasp the bottom rails with their beaks. They were once extensively inlaid, but only two slivers of inlay survive.
