The quality of the fabric and the surface treatment are indistinguishable from products of the Badarian period. The bowl was found in the grave of a male in a recess in the side wall covered with a platter of basketry. It contained organic contents identified as a mixture of vegetable fibres and twigs deriving from the basketry mixed with natron."], "Bibliographic references": ["Brunton 1937 / Mostagedda and the Tasian Culture (pp 6, 28, 33; pl.11,16; pl. 14.5 centre bottom)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["good"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Guy Brunton"], "Acquisition date": ["1929"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA62014"], "Registration number": ["1929,1015.14"]}
