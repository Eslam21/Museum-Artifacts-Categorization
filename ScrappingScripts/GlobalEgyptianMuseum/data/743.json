They were written on shrouds, tomb walls, funerary objects (such as shabtis or scarabs), and above all on papyrus rolls which were wrapped with the mummy. The 'Book of the Dead' of the sculptor Neferrenpet dates from c. 1250 BC, and the texts are written in so-called 'cursive hieroglyphs' in vertical columns; they are accompanied by 'vignettes' (illustrations) which emphasize their magical content. The deceased was supposed to recite the formulae to counteract the dangers of the Hereafter."}
