{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.9136", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMPHORA", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "135.5 cm", "Diameter": "22.9 cm", "Name": "Amphora", "Description": "This amphora, whose provenance is not known, is distinguished by a very long belly and a slightly rounded rim. The surface of the neck is notched, a technique which originally allowed a good grip taken on the receptacle, but which, from the end of the Roman Period onwards, little by little became a motif of decoration. Dating from the 2nd or the 3rd century of our time, the piece served for storage rather than for transportation."}
