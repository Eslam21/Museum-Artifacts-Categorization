However, the fabric and pattern find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). Hayes' Type IX coincides with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) Type 9a. The type closely follows the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. These cups also coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18) and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.289) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.640"]}
