He is holding his right hand on his head, and clenches the thyrsus in his left hand. The features of the face are very worn. The terracotta images of Dionysos are rather rare in Egypt, which could indicate that his cult, which was very popular in the Greek circles of roman Egypt, was never adopted by the indigenous population."}
