The sherd possibly belongs to the same vessel as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.130.5. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) found great similarities with the fabric from Wild Goat Style sherds found at Bayrakli in Asia Minor, production of which Dupont had attributed to Clazomenae. Based on the similar composition types, Dupont then suggested that the place of production for this sherd ought to be situated near Clazomenae, Erythrae, or Teos (Jones with J. Boardman in Jones 1986, p.664).
