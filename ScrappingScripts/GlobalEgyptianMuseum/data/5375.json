The ornamental mane frames a worthy rather than fear-inspiring face with its bony skull and stylised whiskers. The solar disc and uraeus, originally set on the head, have broken off. The face has been very carefully modelled, the eyes, originally painted, are small and set in small eyelids, which are carved in relief and were once painted. The goddess is sitting on a block throne. The front part has an inscription in vertical columns on either side of her legs. "}
