{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA349"], "Description": [" Sandstone stela of Bakenamun: the stela consists of an inner round-topped stela of three registers surmounted by a pyramidal projection on which a jackal is depicted. All texts are incised and figures are carved in sunk relief. In the upper register of the stela Osiris is seated on a throne on the left and behind him stands Isis with one arm raised. In front of Osiris stands an altar heaped with food offerings. On the right stands the table-scribe of the wine cellar Bakenamun, with his arms raised in worship, and behind him his wife, the lady of the house and chantress of Amun Weretwahsu, is shown holding a sistrum in one hand. The lower registers depict a series of male and female figures standing in an attitude of worship. The women usually have a sistrum on a lotus flower in one hand, but in one case both are carried and in one instance the lady holds a vessel. In the second register the individuals are named as the 'wrb'-priest of Amun of the wine cellar Amenemipet, father of Bakenamun; his (Bakenamun's) mother, the chantress Inihay; his son, the w\u2018b-priest Paraemheb; his son, the workman Paser, and his son, the workman Amenkhau. In the third register appear his son, the workman Huy; his daughter, the chantress Nefertiri; his daughter, the chantress Ast; his daughter, the chantress Takaret; his daughter Mutemiunu; and his daughter, the chantress Khatbahet.
