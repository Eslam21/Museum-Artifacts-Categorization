{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA51822"], "Description": [" Glazed composition amulet of Sekhmet: represented as a seated woman with maned lion's head moulded in bright blue glazed composition. Her long hair is divided by the shoulders and she wears a full-length dress. Anklets, armlets and bracelets are picked out in a darker blue glaze. She sits on an openwork block throne, decorated on each side with representations of stellar decans in the form of snakes. On her knee, Sekhmet holds a shrine shaped sistrum or rattle and across her chest carries a papyrus scepter whose long stem runs to her ankles. The green sappy papyrus was symbolic of new life and a sceptre in its shape is only found in the hands of goddesses. There is a loop for suspension behind the figure's head.
