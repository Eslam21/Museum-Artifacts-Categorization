Some of them were never used in the king's lifetime, but this pair appears to have been favored by the king.The soles of the slippers are made of papyrus leaves covered with sheets of gold while the upper parts are made of variously shaped small gold beads with smaller colored beads.These differ from the other footwear found in the tomb, which should be classified as sandals, while we can consider these to be slippers."}
