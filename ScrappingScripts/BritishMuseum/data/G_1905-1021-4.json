The wings are well preserved, and to the left one is attached the minute remains of another figure, separately made, perhaps Aphrodite. The back is summarily modelled, with only the rock shown in any detail. The underside is rough and may be detached from a wide plinth or other object that also supported the missing figure on the left side of Eros. Presumably made in a multiple piecemould. White plaster, with the feathers of the wings picked out in red, black and white paint; black and red paint also decorate the rock, which has a wide black band at the bottom.
