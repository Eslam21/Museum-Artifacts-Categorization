", " This statuette is considered to be a Late Period figure (Sakamoto 1999, 101, 205-206, no. 142), at least not later than the 30th dynasty (Weiss 2012: 446, 711, Nr. 685). As connoted with her headdress, the goddess is associated with the solar cult. In the Late Period, lion goddesses could be identified as an emanation of Amun-Ra. In the Delta, the main cult centres for lion goddesses are Bubastis and the Memphite region. Bronze figures of lion goddesses were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods, particularly in the Memphite region, at Bubastis and Sais (Weiss 2012, 250-257, Typ 143-146, Pl. 37-38). This specific type belongs to Weiss type 145 which can be associated to Sekhmet, Wadjet or Bastet (Weiss 2012, 255-256, 710-713, Pl. 38a-d, see esp. Nr. 685 for this specimen).
