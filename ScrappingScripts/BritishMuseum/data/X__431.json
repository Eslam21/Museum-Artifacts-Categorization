", " This figure was discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (Petrie 1886, 41-42). In another inventory of the content of this hoard, Petrie mentioned precisely a \u2018seated Anubis 4 high\u2019 (Masson forthcoming), which corresponds to the height of this bronze figure (10,1cm). The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). The figure belongs to the type 10 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a rather uncommon type which is attested otherwise in Sais and in Saqqara (Weiss 2012, 86-87, 534-535, Pl. 4d). A cult to the jackal-headed funerary god Upuaut (Wepwawet) is known in Sais (Weiss 2012, 448). Masson, A. 2015, \u2018Cult and Trade.
