According to Lemos, the sherd may come from either a dinos or an oinochoe since it is unusual to have three or four friezes on dinoi (Lemos 1991, 19-20), but Williams points out that Wild Goat Style dinoi, because they are unslipped on their interior, are often mistaken for oinochoai (Williams 2006a, 128). The shape of the vessel makes it very clear that it was a dinos and not an oinochoe."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
