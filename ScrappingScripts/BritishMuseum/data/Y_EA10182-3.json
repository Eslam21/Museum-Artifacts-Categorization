A colophon at the end of the poem names the teacher Qageb to whom the copyist Inena dedicated the manuscript. The Instruction or Teaching of Dua-Khety, also known as The Satire of the Trades, was composed in the Middle Kingdom. Teachings are didactic works, mostly ascribed to famous sages, and they discuss general matters of life and moral principles in the form of short sayings and warnings. The main story tells of a father who seeks to encourage his son to become a scribe during their journey from their home to the royal residence. He extols the virtue of the scribal profession whilst disparaging other trades, including brickmaking, carpentry, weaving, weapon making, farming and others. Although the entire composition may not have been intended as satire, many of the descriptions of the other professions clearly have satirical and exaggerated elements. The last third of the text becomes more like traditional instructional literature, with general advice. The text was clearly a popular learning resource, perhaps in scribal schools, and dozens of copies survive on papyri, writing boards, and ostraca. Mistakes slipped in in the process, which were then subsequently copied. The most complete known version is found on the Papyrus Sallier II (EA10182,3-11). It is clear the teacher occasionally found faults with his pupils hand; the signs written in the upper margin are the teacher's corrected forms of signs imperfectly copied by the scribe. As is typical of literary texts in hieratic, some groups of signs are written in red ink to indicate section or chapter headings. Also characteristic are the superscript dots called verse points, used to indicate the ends of lines. General bibliography on the Satire of the Trades: W.K. Simpson, 2003.
