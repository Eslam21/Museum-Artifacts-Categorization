According to Beazley and Payne, griffin-birds are common in Corinthian but rare in Attic. Payne connects British Museum 1888,0601.563 with three other vases, including the lekanis in Dresden, ZV 1464 (Payne 1931, 21, no. 1), and grouped the four vessels under the name 'The Group of the Dresden Lekanis'. Alexandridou wrongly credits Beazley with the attribution to the Painter of Berlin 1659. The attribution was actually made by Bakir (Bakir, G., Berlin F 1659 Ressami. Izmir 1982, 11)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B101) ", " Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 43, pl.
