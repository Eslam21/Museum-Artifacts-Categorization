{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.5188", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "KHONS TEMPLE", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; ENGRAVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "199 cm", "Width": "90 cm", "Depth": "95 cm", "Name": "Falcon-god", "Description": "One of the master-pieces of the Museum of Brussels is without any doubt the statue of a falcon-god which comes from the excavations of A. Mariette in the temple of Khonsu at the south-west in the enclosure of Karnak and which was offered to the future king Leopold II by Said-Pasha in 1863. Unfortunately, the piece suffered gross degradation during the fire of the Museum in 1946. The statue represents an anthropomorphic god with the head of a falcon. It bears an inscription containing the name of Masaharte, son of Pinedjem I (21st Dynasty). This prince, \"beloved of Khonsu, master of joy\",  exercised the function of High Priest at Thebes during the reign of his father. The particular representation of the god, anthropomorphic in front and  animal at the back, and the style in general pleads for a  New Kingdom date of the original statue, restyled and usurped by Masaharte. It is very probable that the statue was part of the elements coming from the funerary temple of Amenhotep III (18th Dynasty) on the west bank of the Nile which Pinedjem I had transported to Karnak to finish the temple of Khonsu."}
