Type 9 cups evolved from the earlier Type 5C cups and so both types share certain commonalities. For instance, Type 5C cups have tall rims and are frequently decorated with dilute brown concentric lines on the exterior surface of the rim. Some Type 9 cups have tall rims as well but they are most frequently short. As well, some Type 9 cups also have concentric dilute brown lines on the exterior surface of the rim. However, Type 5 cups have rims that are more upright than those on Type 9 cups. Whilst 1886,0401.177 has features common to both types, the rim is more upright and so might belong to either group. These cups are the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and relatively rare at the site. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). Type 9A and 9B coincide with Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type B2 whilst Type 5C coincides with Vallet and Villard's Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). These cups were common drinking vessels, not just in the Greek sanctuaries at Naukratis, but elsewhere as well, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. For another Type 5C cup, see British Museum 1886,0401.111. The number 140 is written in ink on the exterior surface of the sherd."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
