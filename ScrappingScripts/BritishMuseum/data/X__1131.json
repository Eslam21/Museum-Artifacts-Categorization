East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of Classical Greek date (broadly 450BC to 350BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. The thick white coating (kaolinite?) resembles that of Boeotian examples of the early 5th century BC (Louvre, Paris CA 933). Protome busts were produced in East Greece, Greece and Southern Italy. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, (Blinkenberg 1931, pl.147, no.3117, pl.148, no.3136, dated c.400BC and later) and a similar protome dated to the late 5th century BC from Halicarnassus (with rosettes instead of bow) dated late 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no.443).
