{"artifact_name": "figure; lamp", "Object Type": [" figure ", " lamp "], "Museum number": ["1995,0123.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Beset, suckling the infant Bes. A lamp modelled as Beset seated in a basket, suckling a child Bes. She wears a fringed Isis-mantle, opened to bare her left breast. Her hair is parted in the centre and falls onto her shoulders, and she wears a large wreath curving down from the top of her head to each side, with a narrow wreath-fillet crossing from side-to-side and held by ribbons at each end. Surmounting all is her feathered headdress. The Bes-child is naked except for his feathered headdress. There is a possibility that the basket is in fact the rope bindings of a mass of olives to be pressed. Below the basket is a curved high plain plinth pierced by two wick-holes with applied rests below each; the lamp has been used, as signs of burning show. The back is plain, except for a pierced suspension-lug behind Beset\u2019s head, and a filling-hole for the oil-chamber, with a crescent-shaped guide below it. Hollow; two-piece mould, with an inserted floor for the oil-chamber. Micaceous brown to red-brown Nile silt. Red slip applied to the front.
