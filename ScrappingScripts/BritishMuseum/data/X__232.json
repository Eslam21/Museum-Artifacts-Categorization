", " The clay is quite different from the one usually used for scarab- and scaraboid-moulds at Naukratis. This example was discovered along with several moulds during Hogarth\u2019s excavation in 1903. According to Hogarth\u2019s list of antiquities from that year (list of Box 1), it came from the Hellenion area. Hogarth actually referred to North East town, including the Hellenion and an industrial area to the East. Could that be evidence for a second workshop in that area? These moulds do not differ from the ones discovered in the Scarab Factory area. On the normal productions of the Scarab Factory: Gorton, A.
