{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1843,0507.945"], "Description": [" Head from a terracotta figure of Aphrodite. A head broken from a figure, probably of Aphrodite. The hair is parted in the centre, with its waves marked simply by grooves; there is a small bun at the back of the head, and a large plain diadem is worn. The back is unworked, except that the bun is applied. A hole has been bored underneath to fix it to a modern stand. Solid; two-piece mould: it is uncertain whether the head was made with the body or was applied. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt with a grey core; traces of a white dressing on the front only, with a little red paint surviving near the left eye.
