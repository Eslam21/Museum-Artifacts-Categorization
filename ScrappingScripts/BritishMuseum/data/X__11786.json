Scaraboids in the shape of a ram's head pertain to a common series assumed to have been produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). But no examples were found there, and no moulds for their manufacture, implying that though commonly found in Naukratis, they were being made elsewhere on the site?They are normally made in Egyptian blue, as here. The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. The goose, a sacred animal for Amun-Ra, or the duck, decorating the underside is a regular theme on scarabs and scaraboids from Naukratis. This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially found in Cartage, Cumae and Perachora (Gorton 1996, 114-117, type XXXII, subtype B7-11, see especially B9 for this specimen).
