", " Composition comprising several dotted circles is a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 1-3; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 1-2; on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). They belong to the type XXIX in Gorton 1996, which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 108-109). This type of decoration imitates earlier designs: for some scarabs with relatively similar designs, Magnarini pointed out that they could date to the 25th-26th dynasty with an archaizing motif (Magnarini 2004, 167, 04.05).
