{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA31"], "Description": [" Sandstone statue of Itju and Henutweret: the figures are represented seated, each with one arm on the far shoulder of the other, on a high-backed chair. Between them and reaching to the level of their knees is a figure of their son. Itju wears a long braided wig, short beard, bead collar, long skirt and sandals. In his left hand, which rests on his lap, he holds a folded cloth. Henutweret wears a long braided wig, bead collar and long tight-fitting dress. In her left hand she holds a lotus flower and two buds. The monument is inscribed on the sides of the seat, on the skirts of the two figures and on the pedestal in front of the small figure of their son. Apart from the erasure of some signs from the skirt inscriptions (but not from those on the seat) and a mutilation at the beginning of the skirt inscription on the figure of Itju, the text is undamaged. Traces of black on the wigs of both figures, blue in the skirt inscriptions and red in the dividing lines of the seat inscriptions are visible.
