It represents a Nubian woman, naked, holding an object to her chest which seems to be a small lyre. Between her legs, there are a small monkey with its palms at the mouth, probably eating nuts, and a vase. The front side of the figurine has an attachment, which proves that it was used as a amulet. The piece is situated therefore in the specific context of the protection of pregnant women and childbirth: in Egypt, the Nubian woman is the nurse par excellence and the palm nuts that the monkey is eating symbolise fertility and the feeding of the new-born."}
