Close to the surface, in some Roman buildings west of the great chambers [the casemate building], was found a fragment of marble inscription, mentioning a temenos (pl. xxxi. 9), but it might have been brought as building material in Roman times.\" See also Petrie diary, 1884-1885 (EES Archive XVII 47), p. 154"], "Bibliographic references": [" Inscription / The Collection of Ancient Greek Inscriptions in the British Museum (1093) ", " Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (no. 22, pl. 39, 3-4.)
