{"artifact_name": "mummy-mask; cartonnage", "Object Type": [" mummy-mask ", " cartonnage "], "Museum number": ["EA69020"], "Description": [" Painted and gilded cartonnage mask of a woman: named Aphrodite, daughter of Dides, aged twenty: apart from slight damage around the edges, the front of the mask is well preserved. The woman wears a tunic with a clavus (now black, but originally purple) visible below the proper right shoulder; a veil is draped over her head and shoulders. She wears ball earrings and a necklace comprising a gold chain with a central plaque showing three divinities, perhaps two Demeters with Harpocrates. On both arms are elaborate snake bracelets, triple armlets and a second armlet with enlarged bezel. No finger rings are visible. In her right hand she holds a wreath of pink flowers. The hair, painted black, is arranged in three tiers of snail-shaped curls with no central parting. Banks of curls surmount the ears; ringlets fall behind them onto the shoulders. The eyes, eyebrows and lashes are simply painted in black and white. The nostrils are painted orange. The lips are slightly opened. The inscription is of raised gilt letters applied to the painted ground of the veil, behind the gilded edge. On the top of the head, representing Nekhbet, is a vulture wearing the crown of Upper Egypt (here coloured pink instead of the traditional white), its wings enfolding the head of the deceased. The badly damaged scene at the back originally showed Osiris (only his crown is preserved), whose head was flanked by falcons and mummiform divinities. The gilding on the front lies on a ground of pinkish-orange paint visible at the sides and the lower edge.
