The stem and base are lightly fluted, octagonal in section. The proportions are typical of the fine Middle Kingdom examples preserved in tombs. The headrest occupied the space between head and shoulder of the sleeper, lying on one side. In a hot climate, it is a practical alternative to the pillow. Linen could be used as a lining to cushion the curve."}
