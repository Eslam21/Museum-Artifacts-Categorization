Frog lamps are frequently dated to the 3rd or 4th centuries AD (Bailey 1988, 262, Q2158-2161, from and with parallels from: Alexandria, Memphis, Karanis, Hermopolis Magna, Terenuthis, Ethnasiya and Oxyrhynchus). See British Museum for AES 1843,0507.233c and 1917,0904.2. Close late 2nd or early 3rd century AD parallel from Myos Hormos (Whitcomb & Johnson 1982, pl.60dd) and from el-Ashmunein (Bailey 1998, pl.87 X13), where Bailey warns of the possibility these may have been made before the 3rd century AD. Recent excavations have allowed for the chronology to be refined and reviewed for this form, that is now known to date back to at least the early or mid 2nd century AD (and possibly the end of the 1st century AD). Parallels from Mons Claudianus were found in deposits dated to the Hadrianic period, or from the mid 2nd century AD onwards (Knowles 2006, Type C4.3a nos 56-7). Found in Roman contexts in the Fayum (Kaufmann 1915, no. 222). 3rd to 4th century AD parallel from Tell Atrib (M\u0142ynarczyk 2012, type TA III.3). Bailey, D. 1998.
