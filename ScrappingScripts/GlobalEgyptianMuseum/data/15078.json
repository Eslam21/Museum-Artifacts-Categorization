{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62014", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "BED", "Material": "EBONY; GOLD; FIBER (FROM PLANTS AND ANIMALS)", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; METAL-TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Bed Covered with Gold Sheet", "Description": "Of all the beds found, this one is the finest and most elaborate with a carved ebony frame covered in gold sheet. It has a string-mesh mattress and its footboard is divided into three panels. The central panel is decorated in relief with the \"sema-tawy\" symbol of unification; the other two panels show plant designs. Noting the scratch marks on the gold, the excavator concluded that this bed was actually used by the king during his lifetime."}
