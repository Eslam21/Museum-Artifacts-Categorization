The next register shows the god Osiris seated on a throne, flanked by Isis, Nephthys, Serket and Iusas (?), and also by the deceased and a baboon. Then there is the judgement scene with the weighing of the heart in the presence of Thoth, Anubis, Horus the Avenger, Re-Harakhty and Neith. The next register has a depiction of the deceased's mummy, flanked by Isis and Nephthys, being embalmed by Horus. The fifth register shows the mummy of Osiris flanked by vegetation, two obelisks, Thoth and Iunmutef; the last register shows the Sokar falcon flanked by ba birds and ankh and was signs.
