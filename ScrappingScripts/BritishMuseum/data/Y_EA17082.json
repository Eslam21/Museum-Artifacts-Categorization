{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA17082"], "Description": [" A souvenir flask. On side (a), within a double border of studs, Saint Menas stands to front, his arms outstretched in blessing. Above each arm is a quincunx of raised points, forming a cross. He wears a short tunic and a long cloak, and is flanked by camels; between each camel and the fall of the cloak is a vertical line of raised points. On side (b), within a border of studs and a narrow wreath, Saint Menas is shown as before, except that the vertical lines of raised points are absent. Despite the latter variation, and the major difference of the borders, the figure of the saint, of the camels, and the appearance of the crosses are so close one to another that there must be some connection between them in the archetype/mould aspect of their production. The mouth is damaged. Buff clay, with white inclusions and a little mica.
