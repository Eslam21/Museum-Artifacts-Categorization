{"artifact_name": "alabastron; figure", "Object Type": [" alabastron ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.15"], "Description": [" Gypsum alabaster (calcium sulphate) alabastron with pointed end; terminating in a female figure. The lip of the vase and nose of the woman are broken away. The upper part of the alabastron is terminating in the bust of a woman on top of whose head the vase's lip was placed. The figure is wearing a long-sleeved garment and a thin veil, falling over the hair and shoulders towards the front; the ears are not covered and the veil might as well be a wig-like hairstyle. She is wearing a necklace which is falling down to her breasts which she clasps with her right hand; alternatively it has been suggested that she is holding another object thus covering the necklace. The left arm is hanging at the side, the fingers are clenched with the thumb projecting. The face is rather rounded with a pointed chin. The slim oblique eyes are fairly long, the lower lid is more or less straight, the upper plastically rendered. The mouth is smiling broadly with full lips; the nose is short with a broadening tip. The back is left round. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Cypro-Archaic II"], "Production date": ["575BC-550BC (circa)"], "Production place": [" Made in: Cyprus (?)

The 8 is partially erased and faint, so a 5 is possible. Cypro-Ionian style alabaster alabastra in the form of Kore, have been dated 575-550BC (Jenkins 2001, 172, figs. 11-12; H\u00f6ckmann 2007, 189-190, N36; pl. 40 a-d, Type 5.1, style groups 3), correcting the higher dating of Smith (Smith 1892; Pryce 1928. Four examples are known from Naukratis (Bolton Museum 1966.112.A), two from the sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a68 and \u03a610; Boston 88.738; British Museum GR1888,0601.15; Gardner 1888, pl. XIV, no. 11; H\u00f6ckmann 2007, 189-190, no.

All three contexts are late Saite in date. They were likely made in the same workshop (H\u00f6ckmann 2007, 190 ). Parallels (Maximova 1927, 128, no.1; Poulsen 1912, 99; J. Paul Getty Museum no.
