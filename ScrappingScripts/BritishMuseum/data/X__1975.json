Either a Harpocrates figure (on goose or horse), or a baby, maybe from a lamp. Also similar to lamp from Naukratis, now in the British Museum GR 1888,0601.148 dated 1st century BC and similar undated terracotta figures were found in Alexandria (Breccia 1930, pl. 54, 12; Graindor 1939, no. 55) and in the Benaki Collection in the National Museum Athens (M\u03c0 1245, M\u03c01223; see Bailey 1975, no. 282).
