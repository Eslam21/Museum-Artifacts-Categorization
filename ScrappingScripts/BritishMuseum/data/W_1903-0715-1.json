Miss Gladys Dickson recognized the importance of the Nicanor Ossuary, and brought it to the attention of the Palestine Exploration Fund, who asked Professor Charles Clermont Ganneau, a French diplomat and distinguished orientalist, to examine it \u2013 his conclusions were published in the 'Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement' (1903), pp. 125-31. Later the same year Miss Dickson published a detailed report on the tomb complex as a whole, illustrated with plans by R.A. Stewart Macalister ('Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement' 1903, pp. 326-32). That same year Gray Hill presented the ossuary to the Palestine Exploration Fund, who, in turn, presented it to the British Museum, where it was presented to the Trustees and approved for acquisition on 15 July, 1903. Nicanor was a member of a wealthy Alexandian Jewish family, who is recorded in both the works of Josephus and in the Talmud as having donated the bronze doors of the east gate of the Court of the Women in Herod\u2019s rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem, a fact recorded also in the Greek inscription on his ossuary. Ossuaries of this type, made from the soft form of limestone found in the vicinity, were used as receptacles for the bones of the dead after the flesh had decayed, in an ancient tradition also visible in the Iron Age tombs of Judaea. The limestone ossuaries had the great advantage that they could not suffer from ritual impurity as a ceramic coffin would have done. The ossuary reflects Nicanor\u2019s cosmopolitan background with its two inscriptions, the Greek, which is translated as: \u2018Bones of the family of Nicanor the Alexandrian who made the gates\u2019, and the Hebrew, which is translated as: \u2018Nicanor Alexa\u2019. The ossuary is decorated with incised, compass-drawn geometric patterns on one of the long sides, rough red-painted decoration on the lid, and the inscriptions, which are found on one end."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2015, Oct 29 \u2013 2016, Feb 7.
