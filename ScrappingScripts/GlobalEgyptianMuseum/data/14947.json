The parts of this statue were sculpted separately and then assembled. It is believed to have belonged to a princess or even a queen of the Twelfth Dynasty, based on the fine depiction of the face, the careful selection of the precious materials, and in the execution of the wig. We can see the black hair of the princess on her forehead covered by the wig. It is attached to the head by tenons made of a black material inlaid with gold. The eyes of this statue were once inlaid but this inlay is now missing."}
