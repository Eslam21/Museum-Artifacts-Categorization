These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type A2 or B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra.
