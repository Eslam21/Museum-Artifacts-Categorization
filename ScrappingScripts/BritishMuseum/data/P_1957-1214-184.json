Prince Colonna commissioned a number of ambitious paintings from Claude in the latter years of his career (for discussion see 1957,1214.164), and present work probably formed a pendant to LV 175 (see 1957,1214.181). The painting that it records is in the Pallavicini Collection in Rome (inv. no. 210; canvas, 143 x 194 cm; see Roethlisberger 1986, no. 254). It is likely that the subject matter, which derives from the Dionysiaka and is an allegory of Drunkeness, was suggested to Claude by Colonna. The composition is grandiose in its conception, with a palace repeating that in LV114, and the overall attention to classical architecture comparable to other contemporary works from the 1670s and also LV157. The development of the scene can be traced through a number of highly finished drawings, all done in pen and ink and of a relatively large scale (see Roethlisberger 1968, nos. 1033\u201335). Two of these, one at at Besan\u00e7on, the other in the the Boymans Museum (Roethlisberger 1968, no. 1035), more or less correspond, when joined together, to complete the composition and Roethlisberger argues that they were drawn separately after the two halves of the painting.
