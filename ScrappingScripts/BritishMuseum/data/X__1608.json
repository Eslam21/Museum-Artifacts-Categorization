This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to the Ashmolean record card, this was orginally found in 'Area 2 & 3 12\" above mound'. According to Gutch, this was 'found between (area)1 and 35 (see plan) 18 in(ches) above the basal mud' (Gutch 1898-9, 80-1, plan # 9; Gutch publishes this as no. 25 in the plate, but 21 in the text). Gutch dates this to the first half of the sixth century BC (ibid.). Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Parallels are generally dated to the Late Period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt. Thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl. 109, nos. 203-9, particularly no.206 from Memphis; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, pl. 50.1-5, nos. 263-7, particularly no. 266; Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie 1909, pl. 35.11; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69,3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos 1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and theTemple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Armana (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos. 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888, 0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, (SCA), (unpublished).
