", " Square and parallelepiped weights are commonly found in Egypt and appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII). They were manufactured in a large range of material: they were more often made of all sorts of hard stones, especially white limestone, alabaster but also various colourful stone such as marble, serpentine, porphyry (etc.); in Naukratis, such shapes occur also regularly in basalt, diorite, granite and sandstone; bronze and lead examples are at last quite numerous (Cour-Marty 1990, 26-27, fig. 9-10, fig. 13). Weights of this type in igneous rock, such as this specimen, are mainly in use during the Late Period and associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (Cour-Marty 1990, 27). In Naukratis, however, square and parallelepiped weights seems particularly associated to the Persian silver siglos (around 5.3 and 5.6 g) (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII).
