The feet show that the king was originally depicted in a striding position with the left leg advanced ahead of the right. Part of the stone behind the left foot is also still intact. Along the top of the statue base and underneath the feet are incised depictions of the Nine Bows, and at the front before the feet are two horizontal lines of inscription, reading from right to left, which include royal names and titles. Around both sides of the statue base a horizontal band of text provides further names and titles of the king, both concluding on the back of the statue base. In addition to the loss of the statue body, there are some chips to the outer corners and edges along the top of the statue base. However, the base is in otherwise good condition.
