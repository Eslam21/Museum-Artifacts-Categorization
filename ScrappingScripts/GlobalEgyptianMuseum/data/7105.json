The first one is complete, 3,2 cm in length, 1,2 cm in width and 0,2 cm in thickness. It is rounded at its top extremity, then it flares out like a tear-drop and ends in a very sharp extremity. The second piece is smaller (length 2,8 cm, width 0,9 cm, thickness 0,2 cm) and smoothened on the left side.
