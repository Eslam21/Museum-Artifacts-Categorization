", " Lemos places this sherd in the W\u00fcrzburg Chalice Group. The sherds from this group display stylistic similarities with the two W\u00fcrzburg chalices (Lemos 1991, pl. 20-1, no. 236-7). For a parallel regarding floral patterns, see Lemos 1991, 55, fig. 31. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and was found to have originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286).
