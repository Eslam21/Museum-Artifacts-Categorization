{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 66643", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "EL-`AMARNA/AKHETATEN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "17 cm", "Name": "Statue of a Nubian", "Description": "The partly damaged statue of a young male figure represents him standing, with his left leg forward. The young man is holding his right hand to his side, gripping an object, now missing. His left arm is broken. The statue was finely carved in a single piece and was at least partly painted, as the colored eyes indicate. The facial features, the relatively wide nose and the thick puckered lips, together with the local style of headdress, suggest that the owner of this statue had Nubian ancestry."}
