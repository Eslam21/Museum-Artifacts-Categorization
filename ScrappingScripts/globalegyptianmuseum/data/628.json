Even preceding the Old Kingdom cups without bases or feet take on the appearance of a lotus with ivory petals and schist sepals. From the New Kingdom on, the chalice with foot is a common object. Most are made from blue faience, such as this example in Brussels. The top of the chalice takes the form of the flower of a white lotus, indicated by its ribbed petals. The foot, enlarged to improve stability, is decorated with a floral motif. According to mythological texts, the lotus symbolised the flower from which the sun god was reborn each morning on the surface of the water."}
