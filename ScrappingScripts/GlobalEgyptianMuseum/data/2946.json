{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L295", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "CAT MUMMY", "Material": "LINEN", "Height": "61 cm", "Name": "Mummified cat", "Description": "Mummified cat with neat diamond-patterned exterior bandaging, and linen fashioned to shape for the ears. Details of the face are painted in black. The massive scale of cat mummification throughout Egypt is a feature of the Late Period to Roman Period only; the cat was the sacred animal of the goddess Bastet, and earlier also of Re, the sun-god. The precise reasons for the animal mummies is not certain, but it has been suggested that they played a part in the Egyptian New Year rites, on the eve of the annual late summer flood. X-rays in several collections have demonstrated that this late religious practice often involved culling young animals. The neat diamond-shaped outer wrappings are characteristic of animal and human mummies at a late date, the human examples being of the early Roman Period (first century AD)."}
