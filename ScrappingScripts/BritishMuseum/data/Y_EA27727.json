{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-dish", "Object Type": ["cosmetic-dish"], "Museum number": ["EA27727"], "Description": [" Conglomerate or mosaic glass dish: this shallow dish was formed of a single layer of small, irregular pieces of opaque glass - white, brick-red, purple-blue, turquoise-blue, and black, all of matt finish. An opaque yellow thread is fused to the rim. Press-moulded, doubtless in a two-piece mould, though the dish could perhaps have been made in an open mould and pumiced after removal from the mould. The dish is assembled from two pieces with one large chip lost. There are numerous air bubbles.

The type first appears in the reign of Amenhotep II and is last known at El-Amarna under Akhenaten. Innumerable fragments of this ware have appeared at the Malqata Place which is probably the origin of this dish. Bibliography: B.
