{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "209", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY (not before); 20TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENT", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "45 cm", "Width": "29 cm", "Name": "Pyramidion of Meriamun Ramesses", "Description": "This limestone pyramidion, which has an indentation at the top (most probably for the insertion of a crowning piece in a different material), is remarkable for its deep sunk relief. On one side the officer Ramesses is shown in adoration. To his left is the ram-headed deity Amun-Re in the bark together with a seated goddess Maat. On the other two sides Ramesses is depicted once again, this time with the triad Osiris, Isis and Nephthys. The inscription around the base of the pyramidion enables this piece to be dated to the reign of Ramesses II."}
