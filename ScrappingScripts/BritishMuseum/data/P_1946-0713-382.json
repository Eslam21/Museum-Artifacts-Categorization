The Virgin's grief is conveyed by her downward gaze and upheld clasped hands. Poccetti's technique consists of short, stabbed lines of red chalk and shading of one tone revealing the texture of the paper. The Virgin's l. foot is visible and the light appears to fall from the top right. To her r. is what appears to be a tree not reproduced in the executed fresco. To the top l. of the sheet, considerably cut, is the study of the face of a young boy, unrelated to the main study. The vault and upper parts of the Cappella delle Reliquie were frescoed by Poccetti in 1597-8. The artist divided the ceiling into four compartments arranged around a central depiction of the 'Christus Patiens', that is a devotional image of the Christ of the Passion, stripped bare, wearing the Crown of Thorns and displaying his stigmata. The Virgin is placed in relation to the figure of Christ above and the altar below. Although the Virgin is drawn stooping in the BM study, in the fresco she appears to be sitting as is Christ above her. The fall of light from the top l. in the drawing is reproduced in the fresco and the drapery is broadly similar. Surrounding the Virgin in the fresco are seven round and oval scenes held by putti in which are represented scenes from the Passion which the viewer is to understand as the subjects upon which the Virgin is meditating. The theme of Christ's Passion and sacrifice is continued in the three remaining compartments in which are represented the 'Crucifixion of St Peter', and two beheadings, those of St John the Baptist and St Paul. Very probably the depictions of these martyrs were matched by the presence of their reputed relics in the chapel. Although described by Baldinucci (1846), Vitzthum (1972) does not record the depiction in the lunette on the entrance wall opposite the altar of the apotheosized St Bruno surrounded by angels and a preparatory study for the same in the Statens Museum of Copenhagen (see Fischer, 2002), the only other fresco Poccetti executed in the chapel. Poccetti began work in the Certosa in 1591 with the fresco cycle in the vaults of the monks' choir dedicated to St Bruno (d. 1101), venerated by the Carthusians as their founder, and representing, principally on the east wall, his death and apotheosis. The beatification of St Bruno in 1512 had allowed his veneration within the Carthusian Order but not the celebration of mass in his name or the dedication of chapels to him. The glorification of Bruno in the choir, and to a lesser extent, subsequently, in the Cappella delle Reliquie, represents the Carthusians' anticipation - and promotion - of his canonization which finally took place in Gregory's pontificate in 1622. For Nicholas Turner (exh. cat., BM, 'Florentine Drawings of the sixteenth century', 1986, p. 243), Poccetti's style 'is differentiated by the tranquillity of his more contemplative interpretation of the Counter-Reformation message'. This characteristic accords with the favour Poccetti found with the Carthusians - a preeminently ascetic and contemplative order - his also receiving commissions for the Charterhouses of Pisa and Sienna.
