On top of the papyrus flower, there is the tiny figure of a man walking. The man's head is shaven, the ears are large and protruding, and the belly thrusts outward. He is wearing a long, tight kilt. The detailed features of this tiny figure, which include the eyes, lips, cartilage of the ears, pectorals, the folds at the neck, and the twists of the kilt, were remarkably executed."}
