{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA41517"], "Description": [" Naophorous schist statue of Amenhotep holding a shrine with a figure of the goddess Neith. He wears a smooth shoulder-length \u2018bag wig\u2019, a common style associated with the 26th Dynasty. Amenhotep is depicted with almond shaped eyes, fleshy cheeks and thick lips, with a sloped, almost downturned, mouth and crease at the eyebrows creating a sombre and individualistic facial expression. He wears a long garment of heavy fabric with a large knot of material tied at the centre of his chest, with a strip of additional material angled towards the right side of the body. His hands are placed on either side of the naos shrine. Inside the shrine is a standing figure of the goddess Neith, who wears a tight-fitting dress, broad collar, and the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. In her left hand she holds a was-sceptre across her body, while in her right hand held by her side she holds the ankh sign. The edges of the naos fa\u00e7ade are inscribed with text and this inscription continues onto the supporting base, with the lower portion now missing. On the reverse the broad back-pillar is inscribed with two columns of hieroglyphic text, the bottom portion of both lines now missing. The left arm of the statue is broken from the upper arm to the wrist, and the upper arm on the right side has been repaired in modern times. Amenhotep\u2019s nose, particularly at the right side, has been damaged. There is also damage to the corners of the naos, with a portion of the vertical lines of inscription now lost. There are numerous chips across the face and wig, and the outer edges of the back-pillar are also damaged, with a portion of the left side column damaged. The statue has been attached to a modern rectangular base. "], "Cultures/periods": ["26th Dynasty"], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Sa el-Hagar (Sais) (?)

This statue presents a combination of traditional and innovative artistic styles that are typically used to date the monument to the 26th Dynasty (Budge 1922; Russmann 2001). Based on the placement of Amenhotep\u2019s hands against the walls of the naos as opposed to holding the base and the inclusion of a standard, it has been suggested that the statue may date later than the 26th Dynasty (Selim 1990); in particular, an early Ptolemaic statue of the official Ptahhotep provides an interesting similar comparison (Brooklyn Museum, 37.353: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3431). Though there is no recorded provenance for the statue, the mentions of Sais within the inscription and the naos containing the goddess Neith, the principal deity of Sais, would suggest that the statue was originally \u2013 at least intended \u2013 to be placed somewhere in this area.
