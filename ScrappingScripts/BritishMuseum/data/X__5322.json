", " So far, this is the only bronze representing Nephthys that we have identified from Naukratis. Among the finds from the cache of bronzes, Petrie listed two broken figures of Nebhat (= Nephthys) (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41- 42; Masson forthcoming a). Such findspot is therefore likely for this figure. The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). This figure does not represent Nephthys standing alone with both arms along her body (such as in Weiss 2012, 234-235, 689-690, Pl. 34d, Typ 130, esp. Nr. 1575 for this specimen). According to her raised right arm to her right side, it belongs to a group-figure depicting Osiris flanked by his sisters Isis and Nephthys, a rare type also attested in Saqqara (Weiss 2012, 349-350, 845-846, Pl. 60h, Typ G30). A second group-figure depicting the Osirian triad, with Osiris flanked by Isis and Harpokrates (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.261), originated from the cache of bronzes and it displays a similar flat and crude design: (Masson forthcoming b).
