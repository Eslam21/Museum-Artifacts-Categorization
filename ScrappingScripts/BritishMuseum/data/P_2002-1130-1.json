He travelled widely and his extended sojourns abroad, especially in the Middle and Far East, coloured his work throughout his prodigious output. He enjoyed the patronage of the Dutch dealer E.J. van Wisselingh, who in 1888 paid for him to undertake one of his trips abroad to Constantinople, then the capital of the expansive Turkish Empire. Bauer would produce numerous drawings while away and these would later serve as the source for his paintings, watercolours and etchings completed in his studio back home. Wisselingh became the artist's principal agent publishing all his etched work and wrote a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of them in 1927. The present etching was Bauer's second to deal with the Queen of Sheba. The earlier depiction, 'The Queen of Sheba at Jerusalem' (1893), shows her riding through Solomon's bustling city thronging with crowds keen to catch a glimpse of the legendary queen. In the later work Sheba is shown within the royal residence and met with an enthusiastic welcome; Solomon with arms outstretched descends a staircase to greet her, subjects bow in reverence and musicians fill the chamber with dulcet tones. Bauer mainly concentrates on the architecture soaring above the figures below. He also revels in small details and has allowed his artistic license full reign with eclectic sources for many of them. One of Solomon's prostrated female courtiers wears a cobra-topped uraeus headdress borrowed from ancient Egypt where it was the sign of royalty; the pointed arches are inspired by Islamic architecture, and the parasols borrowed from the Far East. Peacocks, baby elephants and parrots underscore the heady exoticism. Leopards too have been introduced for much the same reason. This previously unpublished etching was recently acquired by the Museum."], "Bibliographic references": ["Wisselingh 1927 / M. A. J.
