{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Head of a female terracotta figure. Head fragment of a woman. Possibly a representation of a goddess. The face leans to the left, is naturalistic, though the eyes are almond shaped and heavy lidded. Mould-made and hollow. Traces of a white residue, probably from a white coating preparation for paint, possibly traces of red paint. Cypriot yellow-buff clay with black sand inclusions and possibly rare mica.

Likely of Cypriot fabric, though this would have to be confirmed with scientific analysis. No traces of writing can be seen on this figurine. However this was registered with pieces labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary, during Gardner\u2019s season at Naukratis in 1885-1886. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DA.096) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Department": ["External"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 27 (EEF distribution list number) ", " Miscellaneous number: 642.2 (Accession Number) "]}
