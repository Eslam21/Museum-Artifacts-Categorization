", " According to the Egypt Exploration Fund list, the Redpath Museum received in 1887 several \"paste objects\" from the Scarab Factory, along with two moulds. This amulet might come from such a context. As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al. 2010, 69).
