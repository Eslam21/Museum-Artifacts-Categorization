{"Present location": "BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA ANTIQUETIES MUSEUM [01/027] ALEXANDRIA BAAM", "Inventory number": "860", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "MARBLE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "62 cm", "Diameter": ": 81.000 cm", "Name": "Statue of a Child That Once Held a Lantern", "Description": "A beautiful statue portrays a boy seated on a rock. Motion is expressed by the right stretched side and by the left one where the boy's head rests on his soft hand. His hand, in turn, leans on the left folded knee, which touches the protruding lip of a rock. This animation contrasts with the quietly stretched right side as the right hand once held a lantern, which is now missing. The face is well modeled. While the boy seems to be asleep, the fine hair tufts fall on the forehead and can be seen under the cone-shaped cap. The image is complemented by the fleshly cheeks. The boy wears a chiton, or knee-length garment, that is tied from the middle and a hooded himation, a rectangular cloth draped over the left shoulder. The boy also wears sandals of five stripes that are tied at the heel."}
