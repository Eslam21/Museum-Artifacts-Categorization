A loop for suspension on the back has been moulded in one piece with the cat. The cat was already partly domesticated by the New Kingdom, when it figures in depictions of the wealthy household with the previously established pets, dogs and monkeys. However it becomes common in art only after the tenth century BC, when the kingship fell to a new dynasty from Bubastis, cult centre of the cat-goddess Bastet. "}
