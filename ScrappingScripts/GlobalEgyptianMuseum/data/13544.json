{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "5013", "Dating": "27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BASALT", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "9.8 cm", "Name": "Head of a man", "Description": "The head belongs to the type of sculpture representing a man with a shaven head characteristic of the Late Period. The head is egg-shaped, with elongated, heavy occipital part. The eyebrows are slightly protruding, the eyelids are treated in a very low relief. The cheek-bones are prominent, the naso-labial folds are soft. The full lips are smiling indifferently. The face is modelled softly and even indistinctly; it is somewhat asymmetrical, with the left eye placed higher and set deeper than the right one. The statue had a back pillar with a trapezoid upper part. This feature is post-Saite, appearing  only after the first Persian conquest; at the same time, the head keeps some characteristics of the style of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, such as full, almost pout lips and generally amorphous features. Thus, the statue may be dated pack to the time following the Saite period."}
