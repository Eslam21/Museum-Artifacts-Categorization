These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. Hayes suggested a Rhodian origin for these types of cups but this is uncertain (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 114). Schlotzhauer points out that the same myrtle pattern is found on Fikellura style pottery from Miletus and thus suggest a South Ionian or more specifically Milesian origin for the cups (Schlotzhauer 2012, 108-9)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 52, no. 296) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.821) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.1270"]}
