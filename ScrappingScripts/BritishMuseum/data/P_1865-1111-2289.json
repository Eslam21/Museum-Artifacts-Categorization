P. 96. A night scene with a waning moon. Napoleon furtively steps into a small boat with a tattered sail, looking over his shoulder at tiny French tents, placed round three pyramids. An officer standing in the boat takes his hand, and a ragged and ruffianly French sailor, standing in the stern, pushes off with a boat-hook. In the boat are money-bags. A fantastic and enormous sphinx's head looks out from between the pyramids. 5 December 1814 Hand-coloured etching and aquatint "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: George Cruikshank ", " Published by: Thomas Tegg "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1814"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " aquatint ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 139 millimetres ", " Width: 220 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.
