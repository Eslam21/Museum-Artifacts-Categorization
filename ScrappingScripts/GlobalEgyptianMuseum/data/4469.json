The outer linen shroud is dyed a red-brown colour and is retained by a series of oblique and horizontal bandages of white linen.The body cavities appear to contain a layer of solidified resin, a dense mass occupies the upper right zone of the thorax. The arms are extended, the hands resting on the anterior aspects of the thighs. A large granular mass lies between the thighs and this may contain the viscera.The general appearance and treatment of the body along with the possibility of the viscera lying between the legs suggests embalmment techniques dating to the 26th Dynasty."}
