Several examples have been found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus (Schlotzhauer 2013, who places it in a group without dedications), and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera. However, the coarse fabric and slip, and its application, are all features of inscribed Hera cups; given the size of the sherd, it is entirely possible that any dedication was elsewhere on the piece. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405. Following Furtw\u00e4ngler's typology of Samian Hera cups, the sherd belongs with his Type I-III (Furtw\u00e4ngler 1989, 88, fig. 14).
