This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The Bristol collection holds a series of early scarabs from Naukratis, often said to come from the Scarab Factory like here, and which were not illustrated in earlier publications. Petrie illustrated several other early examples of scarabs and scaraboids. The scarab possibly belongs to Gorton type XII, a type especially well-distributed on Punic sites, but present also in Greece, Cyprus and in Naukratis in Egypt (Gorton 1996, 34-38, type XII, see especially no. 8b for this specimen). According to the examples discovered in good contexts, this type is attested from around 800 BC till 700 BC (Gorton 1996, 37). For various close parallels: Magnarini 2004, 361, no. 11.17 (dated between the 19th and 22nd dynasty). The engraving on our specimen points more towards the 22nd-25th dynasty.
