{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure. Upper part of clothed female figure, probably originally of a seated goddess (Cybele?). Her hair, which is surmounted by a high head-dress, is parted in the centre, and falls on to the shoulders, passing behind two large ear-drops. The breasts are not greatly developed. The dress apparently consisted of a chiton and himation; the latter is just visible on the left shoulder. Covered with white coating, the hair was then painted red, the face white, and the dress and head-gear blue. Red-brown micaceous fabric (Nile silt?) with a grey core.
