{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1429"], "Description": [" False door panel of Nyankhra: part of the limestone false door. In the central panel Nyankhra is shown in sunk relief seated before an offering table. The caption for the offering table is presented as if part of the pictorial scene, and reads in vertical lines. The hieroglyphs for the items are piled up under the offering table, and the word for 'fowl' is written with an usually full representation of the hieroglyph; usually only the head of a bird is portrayed, rather than the body. Beside Nyankhra his name is written in a vertical line in the same direction as his figure, which is the determinative to his name. The lintel and drum carry Niankhre's name and principal title; the central panel of the doorway has a short \u1e25tp-di-nsw formula and both jambs carry offering-lists. Each jamb has 24 entries arranged in six rows. The signs are carved in good sunk relief. No colour remains.
