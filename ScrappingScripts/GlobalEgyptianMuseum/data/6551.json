Both surfaces are slightly rounded. There are no details or nuances of depth or relief on either of these entirely smooth surfaces.  The udjat-eye is simply depicted using the typical contours of such an object. The suspension hole has been pierced through the length of the eye. This amulet probably belonged to a necklace found in Tomb 209 and is associated with a cowry shaped bead  (L 2146) and a heart-shaped amulet (L 2145 (a))."}
