The animal embodies the goddess Heqet, who is the protectress of childbirth . It is in this manner that she is presented in scenes of theogamy and in mammisi scenes from the late temples. One also finds the goddess on mummies in the form of an amulet to protect the deceased and to guarantee his rebirth. Given the absence of any inscription and specific elements of iconography, it is very difficult to specifiy the date of this object."}
