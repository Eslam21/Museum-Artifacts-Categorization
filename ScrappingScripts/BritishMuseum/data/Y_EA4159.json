{"artifact_name": "finger-ring; plaque", "Object Type": [" finger-ring ", " plaque "], "Museum number": ["EA4159"], "Description": [" Gold and glazed composition finger-ring: it is believed that the hoop of this ring is modern, but it quite accurately reflects the ancient mounting, along with the twist of fine gold wire beside the join with the bezel. Both sides of the bezel bear incised decoration. One side shows a recumbent sphinx with a human head, wearing the so-called blue crown or cap, known as 'khepresh', and indicating that it represents the king. A cobra is shown behind the sphinx, giving its protection to the ruler; there is a 'uraeus' on the royal brow. In front of the sphinx is the hieroglyph 'ankh', expressing the wish, so commonly found in royal inscriptions, for life for the king. The reverse side bears the figure of a goose adjoined by the name of the god Amun, and accompanied by the hieroglyph 'nefer', \"perfection.\" The goose is a symbol of Amun, but as a hieroglyph it also means \"son,\" and so the whole inscription may be interpreted as a wish for \"perfection for the son of Amun.\" The bezel is pierced longitudinally.
