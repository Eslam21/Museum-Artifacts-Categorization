{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7127", "Dating": "EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED", "Material": "IVORY", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "1.9 cm", "Name": "Fragment of ivory with a bird frieze", "Description": "This curved, rectangular piece of ivory, which perhaps comes from Hierakonpolis, has small, round dowel holes on the undersurface and the right end. The left end is formed by a rounded rim. The fragment was thus once part of a composite, cylindrical object, perhaps a container or a vase. Seven relief representations of birds have been preserved on this fragment, arranged in pairs in a register - two secretary birds, two saddle-bill storks, two flamingos or swans (?) and one helmeted guinea fowl (?). The birds' feathers have been indicated by incised hatching; the characteristic spotty pattern of the plumage of the guinea fowl is suggested by incised dots. Such processions of birds, and also of various other animals, are common in late Predynastic and Early Dynastic iconography, for example on knife handles, combs and spoons. The precise meaning of these animal friezes is not known but it seems likely that they symbolize the concept of \"order\". After all, the triumph over chaos and the preservation of world order were the primary concerns of the king and his entourage."}
