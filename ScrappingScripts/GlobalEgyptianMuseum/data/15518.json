This explains the reason for which there was much writing equipment buried with Tutankhamun.The rectangular writing palette, to which a papyrus was attached, is of the traditional Egyptian type. It has a slot on the upper surface for the reed pens and brushes with their sharply cut or gently chewed ends. It was made of gesso covered by silver, which has now gone black. It was probably a model for the king to use in the netherworld."}
