{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1903:816", "Dating": "3RD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS ?", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "12 cm", "Name": "Shabti", "Description": "Crudely fashioned shabti of clay, similar to examples dated by the excavator, Petrie, to the 3rd Intermediate Period, when full sets of shabtis numbered one for each day of the year, with a further 'overseer' to order each set of ten 'worker' shabtis. The figures were intended to carry out any heavy labour for the deceased in the next life. This example is probably one of the shabtis found at Abydos by Petrie and his colleagues in 1901-2."}
