Schlotzhauer identifies the joining sherd as belonging to a Type 9 South Ionian cup with everted rim. The dilute concentric lines on the interior surface suggest the sherd cannot be of his Type 9A, while the carination at the junction of the rim and body suggests that it is of his Type 9C, and the myrtle leaf pattern, which Schlotzhauer may not have seen, indicates that it belongs to the Ionian little-master group and his Type 9C South Ionian cup type. This type corresponds with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Hayes suggested a Rhodian origin for these types of cups but this is uncertain (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 114). Schlotzhauer points out that the same myrtle pattern is found on Fikellura style pottery from Miletus and thus suggest a South Ionian or more specifically Milesian origin for the cups (Schlotzhauer 2012, 108-9)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.826) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.871"]}
