", " Simple mould made figure plaques with two crude Beses figures on it. Similar piece from Naukratis is in Bristol Museum (Bristol H2805). Of a type typical of the Nile delta in the Late Period, similar, but more complicated examples extend into the early Ptolemaic period (at Schedia early Ptolemaic pieces from the 4th century BC, Bergman personal communication). Three similar simple mould-made single Bes plaque figures from Naukratis are currently in the Bolton Museum (1886.31.15, 1886.31.16, 1886.31.17). Unprovenanced parallels of a single, naked, Bes plaque in Cairo Museum (CG27355 and CG27256 = SR5/1222 and SR5/1223) and a Late Period parallel from Memphis (Petrie 1909, pl.35, no.13), From Saqqara, there is a close parallel, which as this one, was included as part of a group with a phallophorous Harpocrates dated Late Period to Ptolemaic, but probably from an early 4th centiury BC context (Martin 1981 pl.23, nos 306, 307 and 1331).
