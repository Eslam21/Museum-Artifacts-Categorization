May he grant a funerary offering of all good and pure things to the overseer of the royal tutors, the royal scribe of the Lord of the Two Lands, the manager of the estates of the good god (= the Pharaoh) and overseer of the treasury, Meri-re and the mistress of the house, [Baket-amun]\". The legend next to the figure of Osiris reads: \"Osiris, the great god, the ruler of the Ennead of gods, may he grant joy at the 'Place of Truth' (in the hereafter)\". The lower register is a representation of the adoration of the sun god by the overseer of the treasury.The human figures have been represented dressed according to the elegant fashion of their time with extravagant wigs and translucent pleated garments. The lady is wearing an unguent cone on her head.For a long time the tomb of Meri-re was considered to be lost. A few years ago it was rediscovered by Alain-Pierre Zivie, who has provided the following information. In the first phase, the walls were decorated with paintings, and in the second phase the walls were covered with limestone slabs which received reliefs and inscriptions."}
