{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1903:727", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "1.3 cm", "Width": "1.2 cm", "Name": "Amulet in form of falcon-headed sphinx", "Description": "Green-glazed faience amulet in the form of a falcon-headed sphinx, embodying the power of the lion but depicting a deity with the quality of the falcon, far-sighted and celestial. The underside bears another image of the falcon-god, here incised in two dimensions, standing with human body to hold a sceptre. There are several gods depicted as a falcon in the Egyptian pantheon; the two most common are Re, the sun-god, and Horus, the god of kingship. It is not certain which is intended here. As son of Osiris, Horus would be more appropriate to Abydos, where the amulet was excavated."}
