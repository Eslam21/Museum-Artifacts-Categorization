", " Scarabs and scaraboids with a lion motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions, with the specific motif displayed on this scaraboid being found on several examples and notably in the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45, see especially 44 as a close parallel for this piece). This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A72a).
