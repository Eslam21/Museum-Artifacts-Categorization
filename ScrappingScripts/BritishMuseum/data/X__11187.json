", " Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail like here, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). According to Gorton, this scarab belongs to a standard group of the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, notably on Punic sites and in the Levant, her type XXXI (Gorton 1996, 112-114, type XXXI subtype 3-18, see especially 14 for this piece). It seems, however, better fitted with her type XXVIII, subtype A140-148 (Gorton 1996, 98-99). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems plausible that the inscription was meant as a trigram to write the name of Amun in a cryptic way (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957).
