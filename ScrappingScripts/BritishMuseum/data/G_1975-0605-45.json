"], "Cultures/periods": [" Archaic Greek ", " Classical Greek ", " Achaemenid "], "Production date": ["550BC - 350BC"], "Materials": ["bronze"], "Type series": ["Baitinger IID1"], "Dimensions": [" Length: 1.70 centimetres "], "Curator's comments": ["These socketed trilobate types are common in the Middle East from the 7th century BC and subsequently in Greece and Egypt. During the course of the 4th century BC, arrow heads tend to become larger and this type is abandoned. This example has good parallels from the mid 6th to 4th centuries BC (Baitinger 2001, figs 472, Dreifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IID1-3). James dates this type (James 2004, fig. 675) between Achaemenid and early Hellenistic periods. This type is cited as evidence by Snodgrass of Persian archers at the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae and adopted in Greece subsequently, though this type is dated elsewhere from the 7th century BC onwards.
