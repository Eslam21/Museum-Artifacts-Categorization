Seems to be a Cypriot limestone sculpture of the same style as various mouldmade Cypriot figurines of the same size. See also BM 1886,0401.1479 from Naukratis. The Cypriot style was of a standardised figurine of a type dated to the second half of 7th century BC (Karageorghis 1995, 49-51, Pl XXV. 2-4 Type I(viii) 34-8, from Idalion, Ayia Irini, Ayios Georghios Spatharikou, Samos and unprovenanced). Similar terracotta figurines have been found at Naukratis (BM 1886,0401.1479, Gardner 1888: Pls XV.1&5, XIV.8). A number of similar limestone sculptures GR 1886,0401.1391 and GR 1888,0601.26 were also found at Naukratis and are currently in the British Museum. A parallel found in an excavated context in Samos is dated 580BC-570BC (Henke 2013 pers.comm). Bibliography: Karageorghis, V. 1995. \u2018The coroplastic art of ancient Cyprus. IV.
