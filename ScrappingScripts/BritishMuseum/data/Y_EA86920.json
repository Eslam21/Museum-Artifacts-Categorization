{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86920"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration with a partly glossy surface. The rear is concave and shows a wooden impression like from a bolt, perpendicular to it two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.2 cm. The front has a small flat area with downwards bent sides. On the flat area small parts of an oval scarab-like seal-impression. Visible is a thin circumferential line. In the lower middle part a stylised nbw sign (Gardiner S12), above it a horizontal oval field with a line, inside a spiral that continued further to the left. A small nfr-sign at the right end of the seal. The same motif is found on EA86820 and on EA86923. The latter shows that there is an ankh-sign to the left of the nbw.
