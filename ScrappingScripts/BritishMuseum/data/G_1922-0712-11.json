{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1922,0712.11"], "Description": [" Bronze plastic lamp in the form of an elephant's head, the hinged lid modelled as an armoured rider wearing a cuirass and Thracian helmet. The nozzle (now broken) projected forward; the elephant's trunk curves away to the right, its tip lost. The tusks are lost; they were made of iron and inserted separately. At the rear are stumps of a double rod-handle, curving upwards. The base is formed by the elephant's neck, and is almost circular and sunken within.
