{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86961"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine Nile clay that was burnt and now is completely black in colour like EA86955. The object was hardened after excavation and shows a shiny surface. On the rear on one side two coils of basketry, on a second side again two coils of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front is flat and shows one complete impression of an oval scarab-like seal with few finger impressions around it. The seal itself is almost completely preserved and shows three nfr signs next to each other in the middle. On top and underneath each a nb-basket framing the nfrs with the convex side to the ends of the seal. A finger impression partly covers the seal impression and a white accretion can be found on the surface.
