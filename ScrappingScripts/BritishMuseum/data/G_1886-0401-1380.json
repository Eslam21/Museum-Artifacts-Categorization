An alternative interpretation would be use as a measure; the jug has a capacity of about 0.375 litres. A further very similar piece with a Carian inscription is known from in Egypt (Berlin, \u00c4gyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, Inv. 7206; Schlotzhauer 2012, 168 no. Nau 139, pl. 30c-e); with precise findspot information lacking it might have come from Naukratis or a site with a strong Carian presence such as Memphis/Saqqara. For the latter two piecse, NA analysis by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, has confirmed production in the Nile Delta (samples Nauk 14 and 19: chemical group QanN), see Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006,55 table 1, 62-3, figs 35-6.
