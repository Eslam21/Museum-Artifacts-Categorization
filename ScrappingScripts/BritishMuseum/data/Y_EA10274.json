No other extensive copy of the verso text is known (although it may be the same as the Discourse of the Fowler on P. Moscow 1695), but the full copies of the Eloquent Peasant suggest that this must once have been a long roll. The Fowler's laments concern the loss of the pastoral landscape, and the woes of fowling, as he petitions his master for protection and help. In the Eloquent Peasant, the peasant Khunanup is tricked and swindled by a greedy landowner who wishes to seize Khunanup\u2019s donkeys. His case is brought before the high steward who is so intrigued by the peasant\u2019s gift for words that he forces him to endlessly repeat his elegant speeches so they can be recorded and presented to the king. After much suffering, Khunanup is finally granted justice. The tale is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Middle Kingdom literature. ", " Bibliography: Parkinson, R.
