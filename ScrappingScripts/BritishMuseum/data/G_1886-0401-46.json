{"artifact_name": "moulding", "Object Type": ["moulding"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.46"], "Description": [" Marble fragment of profile with spiral. The cross-section of the profile is on the preserved upper part almost circular (radius 4,1 cm) and opens on the lower part. It could therefore have built an Ionic cyma and not an ovolo moulding. The lateral surface of the cymas is cut flatly on the left side. From there a spiral and flat cove is worked in and is framed by bars. On the bush-hammered upper side of the fragment, two scratch lines run parallel to the front side. The light grey marble fragment is almost not weathered, however, fractured on the back and lower side.

The special decoration with the spiral on the heading joint indicates the usage of the original piece on a special location in the building: maybe the cyma bluntly impinges here on a flat wall.
