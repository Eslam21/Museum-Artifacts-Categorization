The lack of a rim and other diagnostic featuresmakes it impossible to confirm the shape of the cup. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape and they coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (p. 713, no. 708) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 54, no. 12) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.263) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.169"]}
