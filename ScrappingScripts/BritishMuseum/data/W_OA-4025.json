", " This type and the similar qis\u1e6d and half- qis\u1e6d stamps (e.g. OA+ 4032 and OA+ 4033) belong to the first part of al- al-Q\u0101sim\u2019s Finance Directorship. He appears to have employed no other qis\u1e6d-system dies before the dated issues with the names of his executives, which begin in 119/737. The last word of the legend is written alif, w\u0101w, f\u0101 ', the letters of w\u0101f, but written out of order. On all three denominations of this series the \u2018\u1e6da '\u2019 of qis\u1e6d is followed by an alif which is accompanied by a semicircular mark pointing upwards. On the qis\u1e6d and quarter- qis\u1e6d stamps the semicircle follows immediately; on the half-qis\u1e6d it is on the line below and w\u0101f intervenes. There is a dot in the semicircle on qis\u1e6d and half-qis\u1e6d. Opinion has been divided over whether the mark is an ornament or a letter, n\u016bn or r\u0101' . Launois read mus\u1e6d\u0101r 'must, new wine'; Balog (1976, p. 30) has suggested that qis\u1e6d\u0101n or qis\u1e6d\u0101r is an otherwise unknown measure of capacity. Miles pointed out that qis\u1e6d\u0101n could be the dual form of qis\u1e6d, meaning 2 qis\u1e6ds, but preferred to take the semicircle as an ornament. Only the last of these suggestions seems likely. The pattern of issues before and after the series under discussion also suggests that they are in function ordinary qis\u1e6d-system types. Epigraphically as well it is difficult to read the mark as a letter. It has not been pointed out that it differs greatly from the form of final n\u016bn in use in early Kufic, and also from r\u0101'. In most later scripts the tail of final n\u016bn does curve round to about the level of the head, but on the glass and early coinage final n\u016bn is a downstroke with a relatively slight curve to the left in the lower part; at times it is indistinguishable from r\u0101'. The dot inside the semicircle on the qis\u1e6d and half-qis\u1e6d is, of course, correct for n\u016bn but there is no other example of the use of consonantal pointing on the glass weights. Finally, the position of the semicircle on the half-qis\u1e6d, after w\u0101f, also argues against its being a letter. Words can, under certain circumstances, be divided between lines in early Kufic, but the second part of a divided word is placed at the beginning of the next line. It should be noted that semicircles which are unmistakably ornamental occur on other stamps from the early part of al-Q\u0101sim's period of office (e.g. OA+ 4177, OA+ 4320 OA+ 4321 and 1889,0604.68), as well as an anonymous counterstamp in use at the same time (e.g. OA+ 4292, OA+ 4293, OA+ 4103 and 1895,1220.7). The alif at the end of qis\u1e6d still requires explanation; it could be an accusative, but, if so, is ungrammatical. Miles was probably right to suggest that it is a variant form of a loan-word. Q\u012br\u0101t also a borrowing from Greek, occasionally occurs with a similar final aiif (e.g. on OA+ 4261).
