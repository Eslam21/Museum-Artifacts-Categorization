Here the saint is literally surrounded by the human figures, as the woman in the foreground seen from behind closes the circle around the hermit, differently from all the other drawings of the series where St Antony is partially ringed or his tormentors are to the side. In this regard it is similar to 1907-7-17-13, which represents a 'Temptation' but it is not part of the present series. A similar combination of temptation and punishment can be seen in the drawings listed under no. 1907-7-17-50. One of the figures is crowned as in the drawings listed under no. 1907-7-17-42. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
