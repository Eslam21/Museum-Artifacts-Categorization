His typical feather crown is supported by some sort of pedestal on which a minute lioness is depicted. The lioness may refer to Hathor in her untamed guise - according to the myth she was pacified with Bes's help and persuaded to return to Egypt. The face is forceful because of the curved eyebrows and the large eyes with multiple folds in the lids, the wide nose and in particular because of the ornamental spiral locks of the full beard. The back of the crown has a hole for suspension of the amulet."}
