This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Fragments from Ashmolean, Museum, Oxford join (AN1896-1908-E.4671.25 and AN1896-1908-G.81). According to register card in Ashmolean Egyptian Department, this was from the Hellenion precinct (location 14), under the wall of 2nd temple, but no such information is recorded in the register book. Dated by Gutch to the Late fifth century BC (1898-9, 79, pl. X.16C, no.16). East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of Classical Greek date (broadly 480BC to 330BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin, particularly those from Rhodes. Protome busts were produced in East Greece, Greece and Southern Italy. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019, though numerous production places likely existed across East Greece. Protomes (also called busts, shoulder-busts, protome-busts and erroneously \u2018masks\u2019) were first made in East Greece around 550BC (Croissant 1983) then Greece (Robinson 1931; 1933; 1952; Szab\u00f3 1994) and Magna Graeca (Kilmer 1977, 65-7) in the late Archaic period. The earliest forms simply show the head with a framing veil, though increased complexity and details resulted in half of the figure being represented by the 5th century BC (Mandel & Gossel-Raeck 2004). By the mid-5th century they become less common, though rare finds have been found, in Hellenistic contexts (Kilmer 1977, 66; Smith 1949, 355; Stampolid\u0113s et al. 2011, 383, no. 72). Protomes are primarily found in sanctuaries, graves (possibly reused Kilmer 1977, 68; not used as funeral masks, Smith 1949, 355) and occasionally in domestic contexts (Higgins 1954; Kilmer 1977, 68). Protomes have been interpreted as representations of Hera, Athena, Aphrodite (Aphrodite in Naukratis, Smith 1949, 355, fn. 3, figs. 6 & 7), Demeter or Kore as a chthonic goddess (contra Blinkenberg 1931, 588-9), but are more commonly thought to represent the devotee (ibid; Croissant 1983). Many fragmentary parallels of protomes and protome-busts from Naukratis in Archaic and Classical Greek style in East Greek and local Egyptian fabrics.
