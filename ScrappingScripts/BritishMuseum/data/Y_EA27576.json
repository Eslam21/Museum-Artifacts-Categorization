This type has been found in Tripolitanian amphorae dating to the 1st to 2nd centuries AD, with technical features distinctive of being used to seal wine amphorae (ibid.). However a Tripolitanian source is unlikely as this type has also been found in Egypt with Byzantine finds in Kellia (Egloff 1977: 180, pl 20.10). Similar seal motifs have been found in Byzantine contexts at Kellia (ibid.) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966: pl. XXVIII.16, though may be residual) and on a 3rd \u2013 2nd century BC stamp from the Fayum (Bailey 2008: 160, Pl.110, no.3601), giving this a very broad date range. Quadrupeds, especially donkeys, were a common device on Christian period plaster amphora stoppers found in Egypt at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.10), Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 28.16) and Naukratis (EA 27576), as well as on mud stoppers from Western Thebes (identified as a deer, Winlock and Crum, 80, fig. 33.16\u201317).
