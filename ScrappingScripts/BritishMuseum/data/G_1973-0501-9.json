{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.9"], "Description": [" Terracotta squatting biphallic figure of soldier. A Macedonian soldier in mufti, though largely naked, and modelled in the round. He is seated on a largely rectangular plinth, his right knee raised, his left leg bent and flat to the ground, the foot emerging from below his right buttock. He has two large phalluses, held by each hand, one rising up to rest on his right shoulder; the other curving to his left side, its tip is lost. He wears a narrow and waisted chlamys running down his back and extending to the bottom of the plinth. His head is broken away, but he probably wore a kausia. Solid; probably made in a two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a greybrown core; the mica particles are small. Traces remain of an overall thick white dressing, painted pink in the flesh areas; the top of the plinth is painted blue; the cloak may have been left white, and there are spots of black paint beneath the plinth.
