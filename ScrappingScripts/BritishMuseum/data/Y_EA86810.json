{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86810"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows one side with two rows of basketry coil and one side with one row of basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between a lid and a wall of a basket. At the flat upper side is an impression of a very small oval seal visible. It shows a circumferential line, at the bottom a nb-basket and above the head of a ram, facing towards the left, wearing a crown that is not very well visible but looks like a double feather crown. There are many finger impressions around the seal and some black surface colouration probably due to a fire. Same motif can be found on EA86945 and EA86949.
