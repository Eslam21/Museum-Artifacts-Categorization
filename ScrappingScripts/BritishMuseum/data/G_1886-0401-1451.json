{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1451"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Isis anasyr(o)mene. A figure of \u2018Isis-Aphrodite anasyr(o)mene\u2019, perhaps Isis-Bubastis, holding the front of her tunic up to show her pubic area; the back of the garment falls in curved folds of drapery beside her legs. She stands on a small, round-fronted, inadequate plinth. Her hair is parted in the middle and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears a huge, closely woven double-wreath bound across the front with a narrow horizontal garland tied at each side; leaves fall beside her upper arms, below these leaves hang wide ribbons from the headdress. From the top of the wreath rises a large flaring kalathos, surviving to its full height only at the back. The back is plain. The front is covered with a white dressing and the flesh is left in this colour, except for the right forearm, which appears to be painted red. The dress is painted pink, as is the lowermost element of the double-wreath: the upper part is painted yellow. The horizontal garland is painted blue and its ribbon ties are red. Also painted blue are the leaves hanging from the wreath. The plinth is coloured red. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt, with abundant fine gold mica, quartz and white inclusions.

Petrie dates this workshop to about the end of the 1st century AD, Bailey 3rd to 2nd century BC. Scientific analysis of the white dressing shows it to be gypsum with a small quantity of quartz (British Museum Department of Scientific Research Report 7048, 10 May 1999). Her hands, while holding up the tunic (which has short sleeves), are in the same pose as many naked Hathor figures (British Museum Terracotta 2991\u20133000, British Museum GR1888,0601.110, GR1886,0401.1448 also from Naukratis).
