{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA986"], "Description": [" Green siltstone head from a fragmentary statue of Thutmose III, the body and base now missing. The king is depicted wearing the hedjet or white crown of Upper Egypt, with the tip of the tall crown now broken off. A horizontal band set low across the forehead indicates the edges of the crown, extending behind the ears to the back of the head. The hooded body of the now headless uraeus cobra sits above the kings forehead. His eyes are almond shaped with elongated cosmetic lines which extend towards the temples. The nose is slim and slightly hooked, with a narrow mouth that subtly curves upwards at the outer corners to create a small smile. At the left side of the chin are the remains of a false beard. The face is rounded and fleshy with subtle modelling at the cheeks and around the mouth. On the reverse are the remains of the back-pillar, left uninscribed, with the top and bottom of the pillar now missing. The head is broken at the neck, with damage to the outer edges of the back-pillar on the reverse. There are slight scratches to the face and crown, however the object is otherwise in good condition.

The statue head was then identified as royal, though the subject was debated due to the similarity of the stylistic features shared between representations of Thutmose III and Hatshepsut (Hall 1927; Shaw 1995). From further detailed studies of the surviving statues of both figures, the head is now generally agreed to represent Thutmose (PM VIII: Bay 1995; Laboury 1998; Vandenbeusch et al 2016). Comparable examples of Thutmose III in sculpture and composed of the same material were established within his Festival Hall at Karnak temple, leading to suggestions that this British Museum head also originated from Karnak, and may once have belonged to a seated statue of the king (Bay 1995; Russmann 2001). The material, described varyingly as green basalt (Hall 1927), greywacke (Russmann 2001), and green siltstone (Vandenbeusch et al 2016), is suggested to have been an ideologically significant choice of stone that may have also related to the original context at Karnak (Russmann 2001).
