He is wearing a wig that does not cover his ears; his eyes are almond shaped and the eyebrows are wide. The body has been somewhat roughly hewn: the hands and feet are both overly large. He is wearing a semi-transparent, short-sleeved shirt with gathered neck opening, while the skirt is long and tied at the waist. There is no inscription to tell us the owner's name."}
