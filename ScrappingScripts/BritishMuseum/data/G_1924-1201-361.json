A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1262) (phase 2) ", " Williams 1983 / Sophilos in the British Museum (p. 162 note 25) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["dance"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.361"], "Joined objects": [" Joined Object Group: G16333 (2 objects) "]}
