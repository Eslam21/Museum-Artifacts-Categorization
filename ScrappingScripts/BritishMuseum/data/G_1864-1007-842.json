Description in Biliotti's Kamiros diary: Fragments of porcelain and stone statuettes and animals . No marking of excavation day visible on the object itself.

It lists the contents of each grave and votive deposit, along with their corresponding registration numbers; (4) the Kamiros index cards, written by Donald Bailey in the 1960\u2019s. These mainly record the contents of graves from the Fikellura cemetery and are organised according to tomb group; (5) the Kamiros well list, which is based upon the Kamiros tomb list with additions by Reynold Higgins and Virginia Webb.
