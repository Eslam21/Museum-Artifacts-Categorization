One of these \"corpora\" came to be designated with the name of \"The Book of Breathing\". Written in hieratic on leaves of papyrus, the texts were placed on the mummies. There were also abbreviated versions which  the deceased wore round the neck by way of a \"phylactery\". This example of a single leaf of papyrus belonged to the Lady Takhabes, who probably lived in the 1st-2nd century of our era at Thebes."}
