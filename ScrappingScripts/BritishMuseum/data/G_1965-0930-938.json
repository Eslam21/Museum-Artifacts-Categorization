Common at Naukratis (The Petrie Museum UC16475; British Museum GR1965,0930.968, 1965,0930.973, 1965,0930.941, 1965,0930.938, 1886,0401.1515) with further parallels attributed to Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.SU.154, E.97.1914; British Museum GR2011,5011.5, 2011,5011.4). Parallel found on Cyprus (Karageorghis 1984, 219, pl.42.3, fig.2, Louvre no. 2114, p219) and unprovenanced (British Museum EA90341). Very close to common 4th and 3rd century BC examples holding a drum (Thomas type L-I.6) known from Memphis and Saqqara (Quibell, 1907; Martin 1981; 1987). Uncertain whether these represent earlier variants of L-I.6 or just regional variants. Dated approximately 5th to 3rd century BC. Karageorghis, V. 1984. Dionysiaca and erotica from Cyprus.
