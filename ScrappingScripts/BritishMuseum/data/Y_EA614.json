{"artifact_name": "stela; tomb-relief; door-jamb", "Object Type": [" stela ", " tomb-relief ", " door-jamb "], "Museum number": ["EA614"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Tjetji: divided into three unequal fields. At the top is a fourteen-line autobiographical inscription reading from right to left. The lower left portion depicts Tjetji facing right, in high raised relief, with two members of his staff; a small figure presents offerings before him. The lower right field is an elaborate offering prayer written in five vertical rows, listing wishes for the Afterlife. There is a large figure of Tjetji and the subsidiary figures of his seal bearer, Magegi, and his follower, Tjeru. Tjetji's eye is large, outlined by a flat band representing eye-paint, and extended to form a cosmetic line that widens at its outer end. The inner canthus of the eye dips sharply downward. The eyebrow appears flat, rather than following the curve of the eye. The nose is broad, while the lips are thick and protruding. The lines of the lips end at a vertical line representing the cheek, rather than meeting in a point. The vertical columns of the offering prayer and Afterlife wishes, written from right to left, lead the eye toward the main figure. Limestone door jamb depicting offering bearer: the female figure depicted is slender, with long limbs and big eyes. There is a wealth of carved detail on her necklace and hair and on the feathers of the duck. She has short, curly hair. With one hand she balances a basket of food on her head; with the other she holds a live duck by the wings.

Because the figure faces left, which is the subordinate direction in Egyptian two-dimensional art, there is a characteristic reversal in her hanging hand, which looks as if it is shown backward. This indicates that, although she appears to us to be holding the bird in her proper left hand, she is actually holding it in her right, which is the way the hand has been drawn. Bibliography: G.
