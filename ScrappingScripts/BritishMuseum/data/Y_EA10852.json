Alphabetic canons may have been present in Egypt long before the Greco-Roman period, however, and it has recently been suggested that they were borrowed from a Northwest Semitic tradition sometime during the fourteenth to twelfth centuries BC. Other scholars have even argued for an Egyptian origin of the canon between 2000 and 1500 BC. Recent discoveries have revealed the existence of the so-called halaHam order (h-l-H-m) in Egypt some 1,000 years earlier than previously assumed. ", " Bibliography Martin, C.J. 2016-2017.
