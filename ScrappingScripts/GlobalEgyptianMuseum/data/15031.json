The embalmers removed the brain through the nostrils and the next step was to make an incision in the flank with a sharp Ethiopian stone knife. Through this incision they extracted the internal organs, then they cleaned out the body cavity, rinsing it with palm wine and stuffing it with aromatic substances, spices, myrrh and linen soaked in resin. The needle was then used to stitch the incision they had made in order to keep the body complete as before. The word \"embalm\" is derived from the Latin words in balsamum, which mean to place in aromatic resins."}
