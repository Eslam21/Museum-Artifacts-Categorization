This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Hill and Schorsch 2007, 143-145; Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. This amuletic figure belongs to the type 27 in the typology of bronze figures by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 105-106, 557-561, Pl. 8c- e, Typ 27, esp. Nr. 147 for this specimen), a type which was mainly found in the Memphite region and Bubastis and which appeared in the 25th dynasty. A few similar copper alloy amulets were found at Naukratis, such as Liverpool World Museum 9,9,86,107 and Bristol City Art Gallery & Museum H1034.1. Petrie mentioned two broken bronze figures of Nefertum from the cache found in a building located in the southern part of the city (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41- 42; Masson 2015). Naukratis provided also several amulets in glazed composition and stone representing Nefertum in addition to these amulets (Masson 2015, 77, fig. 3.8). During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217).
