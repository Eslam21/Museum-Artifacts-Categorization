The figure is upright and depicted face on, with a round head, bulky right arm and a thin left arm. The figure has a deep, engraved emanation rising from the top of its head, long and thin with a leaf-shaped terminal, and another to the right, shorter and wider (headdress?). There is a short vertical bar to the upper left of the terminal shape, and the figure may be holding something in the left hand. To the right of the figure are the pecked, infilled hindquarters of an unidentified animal, cut off the edge of the image at the waist, and below is the similarly fashioned head and body of an antelope (addax?) with thin, corkscrew horns, facing right and cut off the edge of the image at the belly.

There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " animal ", " mammal ", " headgear/hairstyle ", " antelope "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi Hamra "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.180"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWHA0030008 (TARA number) "]}
