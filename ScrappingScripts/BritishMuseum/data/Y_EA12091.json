{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1209"], "Description": [" Unfinished basalt statue of a king: except for its distinctive face, this unfinished statue of a standing king is entirely traditional. The standing pose, with left leg forward and fisted hands at the sides, and the use of a back pillar and negative space go back to the royal sculpture of the Old Kingdom. The 'nemes' headcloth and the 'shendyt' kilt are equally ancient, although the relatively small size of the 'nemes' and the shortness of the kilt are late developments. The anatomy of the figure - its stylized knees, its muscular but fleshy form, and, especially, the doughnut-like rendering of the belly - reflect fourth-century style. But the large face, with its round, staring eyes, fleshy cheeks, and prominent chin is unmistakably the face of a Ptolemy. The feet and plinth are lost.

The chisel-dressed surface is much the same as that on a similarly incomplete hard-stone statue of the Old Kingdom. And like the earlier sculpture, this would have been smoothed and brought to its final polish by a laborious rubbing with progressively finer abrasives. Bibliography: P. E.
