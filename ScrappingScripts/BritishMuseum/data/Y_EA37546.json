{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37546"], "Description": [" Hollow terracotta figure group of two priests, shaven and wearing long garments tied at the waist, carrying in procession a throne upon which Harpokrates sits; drapery or wide ribbons fall from the poles by which it is carried on the priests' shoulders. The god is naked, and his legs extend somewhat to his right. He has a shaven head, with a side-lock, and wears an indeterminate crown. His finger is to his mouth and he holds his pot in his left arm. Below the throne, between the priests, is a portable horned altar topping a carrying pole in the form of a lotus column; an offering is placed on the altar. The back is plain. Lower part broken away. Two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt. Traces of an overall white dressing. Small amount of orange-red paint on an arm of the more complete priest.
