The message reads: \"Dear Irving, I'm here with IFAO, working on textiles of Roman period from desert sites. Dominique is here too - I'm really her assistant - and so we have been able to talk about 'the tablet'. She is partly editing the next edition of DHA and could fit in an article there. What she has offered to do herself is write brief notes about her practical experience of dyeing with madder according to the tablet's recipe, and with Woad according to Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis - old method using urine apparently makes the results very greenish. If she does this, it simplifies matters v. much for me, and I could probably complete my bit by the end of March, when DHA would need it. Best wishes, Hero\"."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Very good condition"], "Subjects": ["temple"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Hero Granger-Taylor"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Luxor (Thebes) "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Dr Irving Finkel"], "Acquisition date": ["2014"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["EPH-ME.2502"]}
