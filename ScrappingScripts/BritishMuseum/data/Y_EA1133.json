{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1133"], "Description": [" Fragmentary black granite statue of the queen Nefertari, the lower body and base now missing. The queen wears a heavy tripartite wig which is set low on the forehead and obscures the ears. The left side of the wig reaches down to the chest while the right side has broken off just below the shoulder. On top of her head is the outline of a crown, the main structure now lost, and the remains of a double uraei are visible at the centre of the forehead with the heads of the cobras also lost. While the right arm appears to be held straight against the body, the left arm is clearly held out to the side. She wears a broad collar. Her eyes are narrow and slanted, with thin arched eyebrows and a broad nose. The mouth is wide with thin and sharply incised lips. The jaw appears square in shape. On the reverse are the remains of a broad back-pillar with a single column of incised text, the upper and lower portion both now missing. In addition to the break from the chest of the figure, most of the upper arms have also been lost. There are numerous chips to the stone surface across the wig.

Queen Nefertari is known from various surviving statues and reliefs particularly from Karnak and Luxor, including two-dimensional representations showing her participation in making offerings to the gods and celebrating during religious festivals (Kitchen 1989; Corzo 1994). Though the exact provenance of the statue fragment is uncertain, it is probable that it originated from the Theban area (Budge 1909; PM I:II). Further Bibliography: M.A. Corzo, 1994.
