Twelve men bake bread and leave it in the sun to dry. They then soak it in water for some time before squeezing the wet mash through sieves, after which it is collected and poured into jars to ferment. One man puts stoppers on the jars, while another sits in front of a heap of bread with his hands over his head, waiting for the bread to dry or to be baked. Other men are busy at brewing."}
