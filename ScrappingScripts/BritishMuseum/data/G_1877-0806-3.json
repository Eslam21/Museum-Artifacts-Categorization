{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1877,0806.3"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of youth. A standing youth, naked but for a band round his waist (not shown at the back). He has a distended stomach, projecting buttocks and a huge phallus, largely lost; the feet also are missing. His head is distorted and shaved, except for a large side-lock. His right arm hangs by his side, with the palm to the rear; a pot is held on his shoulder by his left hand. The legs are separated and are not joined as is normal in terracottas. The object is modelled in the round, and something has broken away from the buttocks area: the lower break may be where testicles should be, the upper breaks may just be spalling. Solid; two-piece mould with added detail. Brown clay, probably Nile silt, with a grey core. Remains of an overall white dressing once covered with a red paint.
