He is dressed in a cloak which falls to just above the ankles, leaving the feet apparent. On the large head a wig with rounded edges is worn which entirely hides the ears. The dorsal pillar reaches from the back to the middle of the head. The front surface of the legs bears a representation of a falcon-headed god, wearing a solar disk and holding a was-sceptre and an ankh-sign in his hand. Sitting on a seat, this figure is framed by an inscription which mentions the name and the title of the owner and his mother. The piece comes from Athribis and dates from the end of the 25th Dynasty."}
