{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8485"], "Description": [" Cedar wood stela of Nebamun: a round-topped stela divided into two registers with painted representations and texts. In the upper register Amun-Ra in the form of a ram is sniffing a lotus-flower which is cooling a water-pot on top of an altar on the right of the scene. In the lower register the workman Nebamun kneels on the right with his arms raised in adoration. On the left, separated by two columns of text, his brother 'Iwy kneels in a similar posture. These individuals cannot be identified precisely. The stela is badly cracked and worn away in the upper portion. Traces of the original white background remain, and traces of blue paint are visible on the border around the stela. The hieroglyphs are painted black and the lines between the columns are red. The human bodies are red, the eyes and wigs black, the skirts white outlined in red, and the collars blue. The ram is outlined in red with traces of white on its body and blue on its mantle. The altar and pot are outlined in red, while the lotus stem is red with traces of blue on the flower. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (late?) ", " 19th Dynasty (?)
