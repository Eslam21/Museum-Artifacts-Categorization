", " This small scarab belongs to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). It was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, notably on Punic sites and in the Levant (Gorton 1996, 112-114, type XXXI). Most signs are legible, but reading is difficult: the hieroglyphs are possibly only used here for their intrinsic magical value, as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). Similar inscribed scarab with no real sense to the inscription: BM 1886,0401.1670, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.870 and Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.12. Gorton included this scarab in her large group XXVIII A (Gorton 1996, 98, A144a), though this type concerns normally only glazed composition scarabs and not Egyptian blue ones. Another Egyptian blue scarab, BM 1886,0401.1638, was assigned to that group (Gorton 1996, 98, A142). Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.868 would fit better her group XXX A: the motifs are similar to the ones found for her group XXVIII A, but they are roughly carved in coloured pastes and especially Egyptian blue (Gorton 1996, 109-111).
