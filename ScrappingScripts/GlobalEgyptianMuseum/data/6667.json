The common, buff-coloured clay with its high percentage of mica is representative of this type of  production. The vessel has been polished and the rim decorated with a band painted in red ochre (there are a few drops on the neck). Generally, this kind of ceramic vessel, which is known as \"golden ware\", is covered with a golden slip and decorated with motifs painted in red ochre. It is known mostly in the Second Cataract region, but a few Classic Kerma potters (further south) borrowed this technique."}
