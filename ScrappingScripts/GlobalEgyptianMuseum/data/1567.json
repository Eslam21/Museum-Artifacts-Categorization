This lamp was found at the town site in modern Ihnasiya, the ancient Egyptian Henennesut, known in Greek as Heracleopolis. Under first Ptolemaic, then Roman rule, the city, like the rest of the country, adopted the material culture of the Hellenistic world in place of ancient Egyptian traditions. The large number of Greco-Roman lamps from Ihnasiya are part of this change in lifestyle."}
