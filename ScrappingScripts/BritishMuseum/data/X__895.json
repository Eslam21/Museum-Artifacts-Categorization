This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The context of discovery was recorded by Petrie in his journal: \u2018Two or three iron fish hooks in good state were found in one Ptolemaic chamber, when we were digging for bronzes; these explain a lot of lead pieces [sketch of folded lead net weight] which are therefore probably net sinkers\u2026 In the Ptolemaic house by the bronze find we get a quantity of iron fish hooks, 13 perfect, 17 slightly broken, & many pieces beside three bronze ones. These show that the canal here must have been more important, and that they caught big fish.\u2019 (Petrie Journal 165, 174). This location is described as \u2018a chamber at the south end of the town, probably of the beginning of the Ptolemaic period\u2019 (Petrie 1886, 39, marked \u2018Ptolemaic building\u2019 on Pl.XLI). However, the 'cache of bronzes', that Petrie dated to the Ptolemaic period also, can now be dated to the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015) so an earlier date for these is more likely than that given by Petrie (1886, 39). A number of fragments of net weights likely to have come from this deposit are known (Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,82; British Museum GR 2011,5009.25.a; Bolton Museum 1886.31.77.a; 1886.31.77.b; 1886.31.77.c, possibly also Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.334; Petrie Museum UC54639b; UC54639c). There are also parallels from other areas of Naukratis (Boston 88.775; 88.774), that do not have to have been made at the same time as this artefact was commonly made for a long period (Thomas 2010; 2011; Copeland 2011).
