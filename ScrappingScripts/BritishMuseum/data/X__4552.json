", " The goose, a sacred animal for Amun-Ra, or the duck is a regular theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88). This scarab belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 102, 106-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B24-31). Scholars tend to translate such composition by \"son of Ra\" or see a cryptographic reading of the god name Amun (Gorton 1996, 102, type XXVIII B 24-31; Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). With the neb-basket sign, if its identification is correct, the inscription could be read 'Amun-Ra (or the son of Ra) is the lord'. However, since related compositions show often debased hieroglyphs, it is possible that the meaning of such inscription was not understood. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
