{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1376"], "Description": [" Sandstone statue of Paser: a kneeling figure of the viceroy of Kush, Paser, holding an altar on the top of which rests a ram's head. An inscription incised down the front of the altar consists of an invocation to Amun-Ra resident in Pr-R\u02bfmss-mry-\u2018Imn p\u0292 dm\u1ec9. Prayers to Min and Isis are incised along the base. The back pillar bears two columns of text containing prayers to Horus, lord of Nubia, and Amun-Ra on behalf of the viceroy of Kush, Paser. The back pillar and edges of the base have suffered much wear on the surface. The statue was broken in two when found and has since been repaired. The flesh of the statue is coloured red, the wig black and the gown white with red stripes, but these colours may have been added in modern times. There are traces of blue paint in many of the hieroglyphs.

He apparently flourished in the middle of Ramses II's reign. The reference to Pr-R\u02bfmss-mry-\u2018Imn p\u0292 dm\u1ec9 may possibly indicate Amara West where there certainly was a temple to Amun-Ra. Bibliography: F. Arundale & J.
