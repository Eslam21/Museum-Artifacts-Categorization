XXXVIII, no. 156). Two other rectangular plaques were discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 157-158). Only one - BM 1888,0601.71 - has so far been located and it is a convex one. According to B. Jaeger, (Jaeger 1982, 204-205), convex rectangular plaques exist as early as the 18th dynasty, but became popular only under the Ramessid Period. Their terminus ad quem is problematic. They are clearly attested during the 21st dynasty, till Siamun reign (986\u2013967 BC). However, several pieces of evidence, from Matmar cemetery (Brunton 1948, pl. LXII, 1, 5-6 - mainly 8th-7th century BC) and Naukratis itself, point towards an even later date. Since the decoration on the Naukratis plaques finds more parallels in the Ramesside Period, Jaeger suggested that they probably belong to this early period (Jaeger 1982, 205, \u00a7 1366, nn. 867-868).
