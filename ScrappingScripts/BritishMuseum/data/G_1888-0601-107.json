{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.107"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Isis cradling Harpocrates on her left hip. She wears her shawl with the \u2018Isis knot\u2019, leaving her breasts bare. A himation falls at her right side, and is shown over her left shoulder, appearing below Harpokrates. Her hair is parted in the middle and falls in locks to her shoulders; it is uncertain whether she wears a headdress or a diadem: it may be the himation was worn as a veil over her head; she apparently has loop earrings. Her right hand is raised and probably held a sistrum, but the face of it is flaked away. Harpokrates wears a short cloak that fastens at the front and with a hood (his head is lost); he is otherwise naked. The back is plain except for a circular vent. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with grey core, abundant fine gold mica, dung or clay pellets and white inclusions.
