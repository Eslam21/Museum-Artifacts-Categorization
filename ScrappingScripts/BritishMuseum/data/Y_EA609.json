The protective figure of Nekhbet is preserved almost entirely. At the bottom there are part of the 'atef'-crown of the king and part of the double crown of Egypt surmounting the lost figure of Hornedjitef. On the extreme right is part of a standard surmounted by a figure of Wepwawet. Only a fragment of the original scene is preserved, and this is damaged along the edges and badly cracked in places on the surface. There appear to be no traces of colour.
