Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains healing texts which continue on the verso. The text is written in horizontal lines. This frame contains a single page. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The recto shows the bottom of a page on which is the following sentence: '... heart, before thy father came into existence and before thy [mother?] was born. Nay, but my heart is in front of thee, my flesh in ...'. Gardiner also translates a colophon on the verso: 'THIS SPELL IS [TO BE WRITTEN] ON ... FRESH ... IT SHOULD BE LICKED OFF BY A MAN. IT DOES NOT COME A SECOND TIME. IT SHOULD BE KEPT (?)' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 14-5). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
