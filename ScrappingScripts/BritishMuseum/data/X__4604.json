", " Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.728 was discovered in Naukratis cemetery, along with a few other alabastra. The production of alabastra is attested in Naukratis during the Late Period, especially during the 27th dynasty: \u201cmany thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u201d as well as unfinished vessels in the same material were found in the temenos of Apollo in 1885, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). Alabastra vessels already appear in the late 25th dynasty (examples of the 7th century from the royal cemeteries at el-Kurru and Nuri in Sudan: Dunham 1950, 31, fig. 11c, j and pl. XXXIX; Dunham 1955, 13, fig. 3). However, they start to be really popular in the 26th dynasty and are still produced in the Roman Period (Petrie 1937, 14; Aston 1994, 166; Masson 2007, 612, pl. XXVIII no. 1-3; Masson forthcoming). This shape with a ridge above the neck is typical of the late Ptolemaic-early Roman period (Aston 1994, 166, no. 230).
