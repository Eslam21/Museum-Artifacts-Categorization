A motif frequently found at the end of the Middle Kingdom is carved on the flat surface: the foreparts of lions, udjat-eyes, red crowns together with a few hieroglyphic signs, the neb-basket (\"lord, all, every\"), the sign wadj (''green'').  This scarab could have been used as a seal stamp, since impressions of this type have often been found, at Mirgissa/Iken among other places."}
