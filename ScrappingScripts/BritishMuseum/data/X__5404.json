", " This piece is now lost. Brief description ('scarab, yellow glaze') with sketch from Chautauqua distribution list of the Egypt Exploration Fund. It is possible to identify the scarab with Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 42. The owl sign is often associated on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids with solar symbols (see example of an owl between an obelisk and sun-disk in Gorton 1996, 103, no. 84) or other sacred signs, like here with a Maat feather and ankh sign (Gorton 1996, 104). The hieroglyphic signs may have just some magical value. It is possible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun, but such combination of hieroglyphs is not listed by Drioton: the ankh-sign is only used to write 'i' or 'm' in Amun trigrams and does not have the value 'n' (Drioton 1957, 15). Variant of the same motif on scarabs and scaraboids from the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming): Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 99-104.
