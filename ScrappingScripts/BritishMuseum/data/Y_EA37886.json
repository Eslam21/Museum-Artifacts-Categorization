{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA37886"], "Description": [" Fragmentary diorite statue head of a king, the body and base now missing. The figure wears the nemes headcloth, with a fragmentary uraeus preserved in the centre above the forehead. The coiled body of the uraeus is visible across the top of the nemes. A horizontal band is incised at the outer edge of the nemes, set low on the forehead and with the folds of the cloth on either side of the face tucked behind the ears. The eyes are almond shaped with incised rims, and short pointed cosmetic lines emerge from the outer corneres of the eye extending towards the temples. The arched eyebrows also slope down towards the temple. The nose is slim and the cheeks are rounded, particularly at the jawline, with thick lips sharply incised and the corners of the mouth relaxed and flat, conveying a more serious facial expression. The outer edges of the nemes have numerous chips, particularly across the left side, and the ends of the wig are broken off around the neck area. The head of the uraeus has also broken off, and there are breaks to the king\u2019s nose, lower lip, and chin. There are various visible scratches across the stone surface.
