{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA281"], "Description": [" Limestone tomb-relief of Nakhy: this relief, possibly a lintel from a tomb, is divided into two scenes. All figures are sunk in relief and the texts are incised in columns above the figures. In the scene on the left side the god Ra-Horakhty is seated upon a throne before an altar heaped with offerings. The workman Nakhy and his wife Nefertiri stand before him with their arms raised in adoration. On the right side Nakhy and his wife appear in an identical scene of worship before the seated figure of Osiris. Apart from a large gap at the top right of the relief and damage along the edges, the slab is well preserved. There are no traces of colour.

This workman Nakhy is not to be confused with the workman Nakhy, son of Bukentef, who flourished at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty or indeed the latter's grandfather, the chief craftsman Nakhy, who comes from a different family.
