According to Lemos, the geese appear to be courting. Williams explains that the painter of this chalice was probably also responsible for British Museum 1888,0601.475.g, 1924,1201.115, Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.48.1894, GR.49.1894 and probably GR.50.1894. The painter was also closely related to the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl. Whilst the sherd is decorated in the Wild Goat Style, the presence of lotus flowers as interior decoration suggests that it probably belongs to the later period of that style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
