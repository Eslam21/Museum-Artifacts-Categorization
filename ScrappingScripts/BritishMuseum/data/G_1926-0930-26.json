A female head broken from a figure, wearing a mural crown: a city Tyche or possibly Cybele. Her hair is parted in the centre and falls in locks beside her face. The crown surmounting her hair is tall and has almost vertical walls; it is open at the top. Drapery hangs from the crown, surviving only on the left side of the head. She may wear a choker-like necklace. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a red and grey-brown core. Traces remain of a white dressing applied to the front; the hair is painted red and blue paint survives on the crown.
