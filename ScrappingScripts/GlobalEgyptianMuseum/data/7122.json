It is thick and perfectly polished. Remember that ivory was a material that Egypt imported from Nubia as the limit of the area populated with elephants was much farther north than it is today: approximately a hundred kilometres north of the confluence of the two Niles. Ivory objects are thus often found in Nubian burials, as corporal ornaments, grips for weapons and cosmetic equipment and implements."}
