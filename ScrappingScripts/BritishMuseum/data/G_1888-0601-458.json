According to Lemos, the sherd may come from either a dinos or an oinochoe since it is unusual to have three or four friezes on dinoi (Lemos 1991, 19-20) but Williams points out that Wild Goat Style dinoi, because they are unslipped on their interior, are often mistaken for oinochoai (Williams 2006a, 128).
