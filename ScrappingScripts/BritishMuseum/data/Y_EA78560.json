{"artifact_name": "textile; loin-cloth", "Object Type": [" textile ", " loin-cloth "], "Museum number": ["EA78560"], "Description": [" Numerous fragments of a natural, yellow-tan coloured woven wool loin-cloth, fabric type B. The spinning direction of the warp and weft is 's' and the weave is plain and weft-predominant. The thread count is 5 warp and 19 weft per 10mm. The selvedge is reinforced with 2 warp cords. Originally triangular in shape, the narrow end is finished with 30mm of countered twining (approx. 14 rows) ending in a fringe 125mm long, knotted at the end. The fringe consists of two elements that are 's'-spun and the fringe elements are approximately 30mm in length. The wide upper end is finished with a 's'-twisted cord. A sturdy rectangular patch was attached at the wide top of the cloth to the 's' cord and neatly stitched along the selvedges to the back. The raw edge is turned under at the bottom. Whip stitches attached the patch. The garment appears mended roughly on the interior also. The sewing thread consists of 2 's'-spun and 'z'-plied natural wool threads.
