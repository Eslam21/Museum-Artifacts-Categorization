In the ateliers of artists, many unfinished sculptures were found; they dated from the time when the city of Amarna was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten and Thebes again became the capital. This small head is that of an Amarna statue of a princess and shows the deformation of her elongated skull, and her rather harsh features. The eyes are half closed under heavy lids and well defined eyebrows; the large ears are well balanced with the proportions of the head, and are pierced to receive earrings or other ornaments. The lips are thick; the lower lip is curved above the protruding chin. However, one cannot miss the fine artistic qualities that had developed during the Amarna period and the well-polished, soft features"}
