{"artifact_name": "figure; plaque", "Object Type": [" figure ", " plaque "], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.73"], "Description": [" Terracotta reclining ithyphallic figure plaque, possibly Priapus. A reclining naked man, his head lost and his legs extending to his right, the left bent and close to the ground, the right with the knee raised (the right leg below the knee is missing, as is the left foot). He leans his left elbow and forearm on a pile of cushions, and his right hand holds his large phallus upright against his right side, but its end is broken off. His left hand is flaked away, but was held against his corpulent belly, perhaps holding an object. The figure is modelled in relief with an intended flat back and was probably made in a one-piece mould; it has a flat-faced plinth, hollowed out underneath, much of which is lost on the figure\u2019s right side. Micaceous over-fired Nile silt with a grey and red core and a varied brown to beige surface; it contains white inclusions. The overfiring has caused the back to bulge outwards. There are minute traces of a white dressing.

Two very similar moulds seem to have been used at Naukratis. These are commonly dated from the 5th to the 4th century BC. The bearded face is unusual on this otherwise standard Egyptian Late Period terracotta figure plaque and may represent Greek or other eastern Mediterranean influence on the figure. This may present Priapus or a satyr. Numerous parallels from the same or similar mould were found, and most likely produced, at Naukratis (Brussels Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A1831; Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA590, NA615, NA616 and NA634; Cairo National Museum SR5/ 6219; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no.1896-1908, E.4730). Others probably come from Naukratis (Bailey 2008, nos 3218-3221, British Museum GR1973,0501.25, GR1973,0501.46, GR1973,0501.52, GR1973,0501.73; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.142.1914, E.123.1914, E.82.1914, E.92.1914 and E.133.1914 and similar larger piece E.105.1914). Unprovenanced examples from Egypt have been dated to the Late 4th century BC (Fischer 1994, pl. 2, no.11 and 10; Vogt 1924, pl. 85, no.3; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, pl.83.3, no. 454) or erroneously dated to the Roman period (Dunand 1990, no. 804, and similar 806). Similar ithyphallic figure plaques have been found at Naukratis (British Museum GR1973,0501.36, GR1965,0930.27, GR1973,0501.42; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.136.1914; and Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA585).
