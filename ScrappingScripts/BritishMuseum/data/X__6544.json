This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to Dupont and Thomas (2006, p. 79, NAU32), the geophysical characteristics of the fabric indicate that the sherd originated in Chios. The sample number is written in ink 'NAU 32' on break. The sherd possibly belongs to the same vessel as Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA83. Williams argues that the images portrayed on the komast chalices were perhaps representations of komos activities that took place in Chios. The buttock pads exaggerated the dancers\u2019 bottoms. The sakkos worn by many of these komasts as well as the earrings suggest the dancers, who were male, were practicing a form of transvestism. If so, these Chians dancers were precursors of the magodoi or performers who wore women\u2019s clothing, made lewd gestures and performed as female and drunk characters. The gestures of the dancers on the chalices are limited and consist of holding pomegranates, tambourines (or wreaths) and snapping fingers. Such dances may also have been connected to religious festivals and performed after religious feasts. Williams, 1983, 162-3 "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
