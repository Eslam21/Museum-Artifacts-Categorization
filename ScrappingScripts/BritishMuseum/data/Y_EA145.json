{"artifact_name": "lintel", "Object Type": ["lintel"], "Museum number": ["EA145"], "Description": [" Part of a monolithic lintel bearing a cartouche containing the prenomen of Senwosret III (originally at the centre of the entire block). On either side of the cartouche a seated deity faced outward to give the hieroglyphs for life, dominion and stability to the Horus-name of the king, written in a rectangle (now lost) beneath the falcon of the god Horus. Above the surviving figure the inscription identifies the god as the incarnation of the \u2018Souls of Heliopolis\u2019. It seems probable that it came from the same structure as the lintel EA 74753.
