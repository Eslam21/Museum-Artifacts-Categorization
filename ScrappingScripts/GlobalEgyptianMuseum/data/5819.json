The top four horizontal lines of inscription contain the offering formula. In the middle register, Si-Montu is depicted in a kilt and striated wig, in front of a laden offering table. To his right are his two children offering lotus flowers. In the lower register, Si-Montu is facing his wife. Both representations and texts are very carefully carved. Specific style characteristics, such as the oversized ears of Si-Montu, point clearly to a date in the Middle Kingdom."}
