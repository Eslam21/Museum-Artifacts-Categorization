", " The faience object was analysed by proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE) under a 3 MeV energy proton beam for characterisation of the elemental chemical composition (major, minor and trace elements), in March 2014, by the Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Mus\u00e9es de France (C2RMF). The blue-green glaze of this amulet was also previously analysed (Vandiver 1983, C51, 285-5-681). As other deities involved in protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). Amulets in the shape of Bes heads appear in the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 40). They were produced in Naukratis itself. Amulet-moulds with impression of Bes head of small size (smaller than this specimen) were discovered at the site (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 14): see for example BM 1888,0601.747 and BM 1920,0417.2. Similar amulets probably from the same mould: Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,72 and Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.862. See another close type, also discovered in Naukratis, but slightly smaller in size: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H1042.3.
