", " Shape is not an amphora (as on Bonn record) because of the glazed inside; a thick-walled open vessel, perhaps a krater or dinos or lebes gamikos (curvature not clear from photos); there is no trace of the band of tongues usually found on the shoulders of kraters and dinoi. Piekarski identifies the figure as a woman; it is not clear from the photo whether the traces of added white on the figure's forehead once covered the face (though the absence of white does not rule out the possibility of a female) or whether the dot for the eye is intentional or just a chip. The arc on the left could be a wreath or the tail of a lion or sphinx or part of a tripod? The upright curved thing on the right might perhaps be the raised arm of a figure on the right "], "Bibliographic references": [" Piekarski 2001 / Die Keramik aus Naukratis im Akademischen Kunstmuseum Bonn (p. 37, no.
