", " '19?', probably '199' written on back in pencil, probably by Gutch, who describes this common Harpocrates figure with 'the finger on the lip and the usual lock... only noticeable by its differentiation from the lock at the left of the head' (in Hogarth 1899, 93, no.196-199). Hellenistic Harpocrates parallels from lower Egypt (Besques 1992, pl. 68a DE 4508; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, pl. 25.3 no. 133 late 2nd century BC) up to the 1st century AD (Fischer 1994, no. 583). Very similar to Harpocrates figure found at Naukratis (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA646). Similar to late Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl. 48, no. 89) and 1st to early 2nd century AD Harpocrates figure (Fischer 1994, pl. 59. no. 653). Bayer-Niemeier, E. 1988.
