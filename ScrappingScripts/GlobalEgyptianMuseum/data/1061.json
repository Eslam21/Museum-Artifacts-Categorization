They are probably the Theban god Amun and his wife Mut. The ram's headed god is striding, crowned with a solar disk and wearing a breastplate of scales. He holds the was-sceptre and the key of life ankh in his hands. The goddess, who makes a gesture of adoration, wears a tight fitting dress with the wings of a falcon. She is wearing the skin of a vulture which protects the flowing hair. The reverse of the ostracon shows the fore-parts of a horse."}
