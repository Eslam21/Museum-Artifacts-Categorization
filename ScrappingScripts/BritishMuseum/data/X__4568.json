", " Padibastet (Petoubastis) is a royal name for three pharaohs between the 23rd and 26th dynasty, as well as a common private name during the Late Period (Hornung, Staehelin 1976, 283). This name is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 117-118; on the various productions of the factory, see Webb forthcoming). They belong to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 103-107, type XXVIII B, see especially subtype B16-23 for this piece). Let's note that the motif is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
