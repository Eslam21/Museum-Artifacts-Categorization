{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA371"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Penpahapi: round-topped stela divided into two registers. The scenes and inscriptions are indicated in black ink, possibly as preparatory sketches for carving which never took place. In the upper register the workman ... pahapi kneels on the right in adoration of the goddess Meresger in the form of a snake on the left. In the lower register a male and two females are depicted in an attitude of worship. There are nine columns of hieroglyphic text above. The text has been painted in black ink, while the figures and dividing lines have been outlined in red and corrected in black ink. The ink has faded badly in some areas. The surface is scratched and there are chips along the edges of the stela, especially in the lower left corner.

J. Janssen, 'Commodity prices from the Ramesside period : an economic study of the village of necropolis workmen at Thebes' (Leiden, 1975), 29). A coppersmith Ptahpahapi appears under Ramesses III (Janssen, op. cit., 67), while a later Ptahpahapi, son of Kenherkhepeshef, is attested in the middle of the dynasty (W. Spiegelberg, '\u00c4gyptische und andere Graffiti (Inschriften und Zeichnungen) aus der Thebanischen Nekropolis' (Heidelberg, 1921), Nos. 803, 860, 868-9).
