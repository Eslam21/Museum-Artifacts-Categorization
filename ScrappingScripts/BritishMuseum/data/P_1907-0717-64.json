The iconography changes here, if compared to the ones previously described (except for no. 1907-7-17- 49), relate to the saint being assailed by humans and beasts. The constant number of seven figures which had been associated with the Seven Deadly Sins, is here abandoned in favour of a much larger number of figures that fills the background. These figures become increasingly less detailed towards the left hand side of the composition. One of the figures in the middle is pointing a gun at the saint, who is lying on the ground in the foreground on the left, leaning his right elbow on a raised stone. His position is very similar to that in nos. 1907-7-17-64 and 74, but in the latter St. Antony is instead looking at the devils flying away. Koshikawa (1996) mentions this drawing and no. 1907-7-17- 67 as examples to argue that Domenico often used squaring for transferring onto another sheet, rather than onto canvas, as the outlines of the grid appear to be under the oil of the sketch (see also no. 1907-7-17- 1). Other squared drawings of this series are nos. 1907-7-17- 49, 54, 60 and 63 (although this seems to be a copy). 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
