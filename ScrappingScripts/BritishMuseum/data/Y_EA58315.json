He is definitely linked with the other dwarf god Bes, with whom he appears often on the same amulet or in the same context (on the relationship between these two gods: Bult\u00e9 1998, 379 and 382). As an amulet, Pataikos seems to appear as early as the 6th dynasty, although amulets of the dwarf god are better identified from the New Kingdom onwards (Andrews 1994, 39). His amulets are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (as illustrated in Mendes: Wilson 1982, 32, pl. XXIX n\u00b03-4) and as popular as Bes in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). The large amuletic figures of Pataikos standing on crocodiles, such as this one, are particularly popular during the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 39), though their production persist in the Late Period. They are believed to protect against dangerous animals. Several figures of this type were discovered in Naukratis, though none of the same mould: BM 1886.0401.1497 (very close to this specimen); Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4560; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.709; London, Petrie Museum UC54640.
