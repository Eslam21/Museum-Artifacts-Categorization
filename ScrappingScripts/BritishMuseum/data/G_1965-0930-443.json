{"artifact_name": "bowl(?)", "Object Type": ["bowl (?)"], "Museum number": ["1965,0930.443"], "Description": [" A small rim sherd from a large Egyptian open vessel, probably a bowl, with a diameter of around 40cm. The rim is flat on the top and projects on both the exterior and interior. The micaceous grey Nile silt fabric core is sandwiched between dark red margins, the result of low temperature firing, the heat having failed to reach the centre. Both the interior and exterior are black-slipped. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": ["3rdC BC - 1stC BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Naukratis (?)
