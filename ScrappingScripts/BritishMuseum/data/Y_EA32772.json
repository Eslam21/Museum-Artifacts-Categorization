{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA32772"], "Description": [" Wooden female figure: dressed in the high style of the late Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties, this woman wears a long gala-wig that envelops her shoulders. Each thick tress is individually curled, plaited, and bound at the tip. Two shorter strands frame her face. Her broad diadem is of gold, simulated here by yellow paint. A lotus blossom at the front, its stems crossing over her head to the back of the band, was probably artificial and may well have been part of the diadem. Her dress was a large rectangular piece of sheer pleated linen, which was wrapped around the body with one fringed edge running down the front. Another section was pulled over the left shoulder and arm, and the whole was held together by a knot beneath the right breast. The woman's left foot is lost, but - unusually - both her accessories have been preserved. She holds a lotus blossom in her hanging proper right hand and a formal bouquet of stacked flowers in her left.
