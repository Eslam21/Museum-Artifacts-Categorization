{"artifact_name": "lamp; lamp-ornament", "Object Type": [" lamp ", " lamp-ornament "], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.54"], "Description": [" Handle ornament broken from a terracotta lamp: this fragmentary triangular handle-ornament from a lamp shows a warship with a triple ram at the prow, a centaur figurehead, and a bank of oars. A decorative gunwale is adorned with a crested helmet and a circular shield. On deck are soldiers, helmeted, with swords and oval 'Celtic' shields. Behind them rise either groups of spears or shrouds of the ship's rigging, between which is a military standard. The centaur is shown as about to throw a rock and this may refer to the menacing centaurs on the prows of Antony's ships at Actium. The left side and the top are missing. Buff clay, some mica, covered with a brown slip.
