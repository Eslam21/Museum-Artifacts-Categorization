Also rays do not feature on Chalice Style vases, and while broken maeander patterns appear on some Chalice Style chalices, the shape of their handle zone is different from that of earlier chalices. Rising rays and broken maeander patterns are commonly found on the earlier Wild Goat Style chalices. Furthermore, whilst some Chalice Style vases lack interior decoration, it is the norm on Wild Goat Style vessels. For parallels, see the W\u00fcrzburg chalices (Lemos no. 236-237)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
