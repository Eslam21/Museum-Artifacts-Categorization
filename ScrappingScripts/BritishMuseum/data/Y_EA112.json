{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA112"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Nyhebsedpepy: carved in rather crude sunk relief. At the top is a heavy 'cavetto'-cornice and the inscribed area is surrounded by a torus-moulding. Within this moulding, at the top, are two horizontal lines of text containing normal invocation-texts ; the vertical panels on the jambs likewise contain a further invocation-text and the titles of Nyhebsedpepy. At the bottom of the vertical panels are standing figures of the deceased. Above the doorway is a panel with a representation of Nyhebsedpepy seated behind an offering-table; above are inscribed his titles and a short list of offerings. The palm-fronds of the cornice are painted alternately red and yellow; there are traces of red on many of the signs and on the figures.
