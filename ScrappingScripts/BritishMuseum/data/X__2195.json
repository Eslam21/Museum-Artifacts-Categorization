During the Roman Period, Isis and Serapis were revered as deities of prosperity. Representations of Isis, with or without Sarapis, represented as cobras or with a cobra body, were popular in Roman Egypt (attested for example in Alexandria, Canopus and Oxyrhynchus) and are usually dated to the 2nd century AD (Goddio 2008, 278). The marble stela discovered at Canopus is especially a good parallel for the shape and material of this specimen, though Canopus stela figures Isis-Thermouthis as a rearing cobra wearing the Hathoric crown, and not as a human-headed cobra (Goddio 2008, 296, no. 30). See another parallel from Egypt for a squarish \"stela\" in limestone, representing Sarapis-Dionysos and Isis: BM 1911,0617.22. Similar but larger parallel. This example is generally dated 1st or 2nd century AD (Walker and Higgs 2000, 61, I.49; 2001, 124-125, 151). Goddio, F. (ed.) 2008. Egypt's Sunken Treasures, 2nd edn. Munich.
