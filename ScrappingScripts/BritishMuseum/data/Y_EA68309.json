{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68309"], "Description": [" A large phallus broken from a terracotta figure, perhaps originally placed horizontally on the thighs of a seated figure: there is a broken area underneath, and it is also broken across the shaft. The glans is prominent; the tip is damaged. Probably hand-modelled. Micaceous orange-red Nile silt with a grey-brown core and covered with a white dressing. The shaft is over-painted pink and the glans red, and there appears to be an intentional brown layer over the red, presumably a paint. Narrow black lines cross each other on the shaft.
