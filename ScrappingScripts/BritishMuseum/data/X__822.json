{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Light grey limestone head of a female figure; painted. The forehead with the frontal area of hair, parts of the left eye and the nose chipped off. Light vertical chiselling marks are visible on the hair behind the ears. Traces of red paint on right ear, neck and right cheek as well as the left eye. Black around the right ear,both lower lids, right eyebrow, the hair line and bewteen the hair grooves and right corner fo the mouth. The broad face tapers towards the chin. The eyes appear like added plates and are large and almond-shaped. The broad nose is set above the lightly smiling mouth with its slim lips. The large ears are left embossed. The high hair-do rises almost vertically above the forehead and is structured by means of roughly worked vertical grooves at that point. The rest of the hair is left smooth and falls onto the back. The back is flat. Light grey staining, over bright white limestone core.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The eastern Greek characteristics visible on this head are not very pronounced. The forelocks are roughly rendered in tresses, while the rest is more or less left smooth and even. Considering the Head Boston 88.739 (Nick 2006, cat. 44), the back of the head was probably covered by the headscarf as well (Nick 2006, 122, no. 52; Petrie 1886, 36). Possibly scratched '\u03a6' on back, though thisputative context mark is uncertain as this would normally have made in pencil. Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600- 575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re- dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/ 550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
