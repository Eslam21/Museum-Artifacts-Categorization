", " The sherd was burnt during the bombings in London in 1941, and consequently it is difficult to clearly identify the image on the sherd. Johnston suggests that this vase may be an early example of Chian black-figure. Unlike the typical Grand Style Black Figure vessels with Laconising features of earlier date (575BC-565BC), the use of colour on this sherd more closely resembles that on the reserving Grand Style. Furthermore, the black-figure technique already appears in Chian ware circa 610BC with the Sphinx and Lion Style.
