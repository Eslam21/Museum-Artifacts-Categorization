", " Marked with Gutch number '347', but also '1120.152' (Gutch 1898-9, 97, no. 347). Close parallels from Naukratis (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.16.1899 and British Museum EA 1911,0710.95) probably come from same mould series). EA 1911,0710.95 and also objects EA 1911,0710.92 to 106 apparently came from 26th-Dynasty contexts at Naukratis, including Cypro-Archaic pieces of the 6th century BC. Bailey states 'this appears stylistically to be later than the seventh- to sixth-century objects registered with it; a fifth- or fourth-century BC date seems more likely' (Bailey 2008, 186, Terracotta IV). Bailey suggests this is Egyptian and a figurine, with comparanda that all come from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1896-1908.E4790, thought to be from Naukratis; Coulson et al. 1996, 143, fig. 54:11, suggesting Hellenistic date; Near: Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, GR.16.1899). The clay is very fine and, though similar to Nile silt, more likely to be East Greek. This is not a terracotta figure, but a mould-made piece from a rhyton.
