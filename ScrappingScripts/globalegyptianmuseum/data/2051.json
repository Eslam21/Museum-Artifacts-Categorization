{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1903:718", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "NECKLACE", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Name": "Crude glazed bead necklace", "Description": "String of short tubular beads with a pendant roughly shaped as the open flower of the blue lotus, a common Egyptian symbol of rebirth. The original colouring of the different glazes cannot now be determined from the degraded surface, but might be recovered from analysis of composition. Recent excavations by the University of Pennsylvania-Yale Expedition to Abydos have uncovered the original Old Kingdom faience kilns where small-scale objects of this type were produced in the town near the Osiris temple."}
