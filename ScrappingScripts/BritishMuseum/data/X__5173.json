", " Ithyphallic figurine, dated c. 525BC to c.330BC. One of numerous examples from, or probably from, Naukratis (Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1836; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA599; British Museum 1973,0501.18, 1973,0501.12, 1973,0501.30, 1973,0501.21; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum E.119.1914, E.98.1914; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.386). A similar hand-made ithyphallic Harpocrates figure was found in a 5th century BC Persian period deposit at the bottom of a well (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4653It; Hogarth 1905, 125; Hogarth 1903 Diary April 24th and 25th, well 2 bottom). Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum, UC48351, see also similar UC49892-3, but uncertain subject). The upper body fragments are identical to contemporary hand-made Persian rider figures from Naukratis and fragments can be hard to distinguish (see British Museum, 1886,0401.1468).
