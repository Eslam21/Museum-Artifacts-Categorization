{"artifact_name": "amulet(Arabic: higab/hijab)", "Object Type": ["amulet (Arabic: higab/hijab)"], "Museum number": ["EA77655"], "Description": [" A complete, brown, rectangular, leather amulet (higab), neatly stitched. The case was constructed by folding a leather strip across the bottom, sewing the two sides, folding the top over and sewing it closed. Space was left at the top fold for a string or cord to be inserted so that the amulet could be tied to the upper arm or around the neck. An apotropaic Arabic text written in black ink on paper was tightly folded several times to form a small square which was placed within the leather case. The text was wrapped in several layers of cotton fabric. The text consists of a magical rhombus of nine cells placed near the beginning of the inscription and 35 lines of Koranic and magical passages.
