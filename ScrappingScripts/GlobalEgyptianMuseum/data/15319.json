They were fastened onto a linen-wrapped forearm of a woman, who might have been King Djer's queen or a member of the royal family. The bracelets were held in place by linen bandages, which made it possible to recover them in their original order of stringing. Three of the bracelets are composed of various types of beads: gold, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and amethyst. The fourth one consists of 27 plaques representing the palace facade topped by the falcon god Horus. The bracelets are of exquisite workmanship, demonstrating the skill of the ancient artists in this early period of Egyptian history."}
