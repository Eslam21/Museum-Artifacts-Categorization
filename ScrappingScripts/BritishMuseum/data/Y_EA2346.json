{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA2346"], "Description": [" Limestone head of a male figure. He wears a straight wig that is broken off at the edges, but likely reached to his shoulders. The wig is tucked behind his ears, which are slightly oversized. There are faint traces of a darker colour visible across some sections of the wig, suggesting it may once have been painted. Across the face are clear traces of red paint, the conventional colour used to portray male skin. His eyes are rounded with a heavy upper eyelid and elongated cosmetic lines at the outer edges. His eyebrows are slim and extend down towards the temple. He has an aquiline nose with a broad tip, and his lips are fleshy with the outer corners upturned slightly, forming a small smile. The left side of the wig has been particularly damaged by a number of larger gouges, with smaller abrasions visible around the edges of the wig along the reverse and right side. There are a number of thin scratches to the face, particularly on the left side, and there are several small chips on the surface of the wig. The head is now supported on a thin modern base.
