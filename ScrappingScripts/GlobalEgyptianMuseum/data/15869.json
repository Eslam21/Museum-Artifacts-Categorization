{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 66248", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MUSICAL INSTRUMENT", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "INCISED", "Name": "Lute", "Description": "In addition to the numerous depictions of musical scenes in temples and tombs from all periods throughout Ancient Egyptian history, we also have access to hundreds of musical instruments of various forms that have been recovered from tombs. This lute is a plucked string instrument with a half-pear-shaped body consisting of a small oblong sound box, or resonator, and a long neck. Only three strings have been preserved. The strings are fixed with side pegs and produce sounds when rubbed or plucked. The resonator is needed to amplify the sound of the vibrating string, which is accomplished by the vibration of the air inside the resonator. A plectrum is attached to its neck by a ribbon. A plectrum is a small thin piece of metal or bone used to pluck the strings of a lute."}
