{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA50722"], "Description": [" Limestone ostracon: a flake of limestone with a hieratic text written in black ink on one naturally smooth side; the other remains blank. The eight lines of administrative text (part of a journal of the necropolis) describe the arrival of the vizier to announce the accession of Ramses VI (most probably on II 'prt' 8), which is met by jubilation. The text is somewhat faded. The ostracon is broken and missing sections of text on all sides.

KV 18/6.924 Many documents of this type were found in the workmen\u2019s village of Deir el-Medina near the Valley of the Kings, recording key events (Valbelle 1985). Ramses VI, a younger son of Ramses III, came to the throne in approximately 1143 BCE and reigned for seven years. He succeeded Ramses V, who had ruled for just four years from 1147-1143 BCE before dying of small-pox at a young age. Other entries from the necropolis journal shortly after the accession state that the workmen\u2019s numbers were soon reduced to sixty and that they stayed at home \u2018for fear of the enemy\u2019, which has been variously interpreted that either the succession was accompanied by civil unrest or that a group of Libyans continued to cause trouble in the area."], "Bibliographic references": [" Demaree 2002 / Ramesside Ostraca (pl.115) ", " Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (136375) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/136375) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2011 Jul\u2013Sept, Newcastle, Great North Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Oct\u2013Jan, Dorchester, Dorset County Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Feb\u2013June, Leeds City Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Jul-Oct, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Nov\u2013 Feb 2013, Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2013 Mar\u2013Aug, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2016 8 Mar\u201312 Jun, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018 7 Jun\u201316 Sep, Barcelona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018-2019 16 Oct\u201320 Jan, Madrid, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019 19 Feb\u201325 Aug, Girona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019-2020 24 Sept\u201312 Jan, Seville, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2020\u20132021 11 Feb\u201321 Feb, Tarragona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2021 25 Mar\u201315 Aug, Santiago de Compostela, Museo Centro de Gaias, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2021-2022 15 Sep\u20139 Jan, Zaragoza, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2022 10 Feb\u201315 May, Palma, La Caixa, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2022-2023 21 Jun\u201326 Feb, Valencia, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2023 29 Mar\u201323 Jul, Lleida, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt "], "Condition": ["fair (text faded)"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Ramses VI"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Mohammed Mohassib"], "Acquisition date": ["1912"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA50722"], "Registration number": ["1912,0210.62"]}
