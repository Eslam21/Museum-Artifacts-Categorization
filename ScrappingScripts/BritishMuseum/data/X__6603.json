This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " For similar sphinxes, see British Museum 1888,0601.474.i. Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the third stage of the Group of the Simple Figures. The vases in this group were probably all produced by the same hand. The leading vase from this group is the Tarentum chalice (Lemos 1991, no. 938). Flat-headed passant sphinxes with long hair falling in three separate tresses are a recurrent theme. The Ure Museum received sherds from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in 1926, several years after Petrie and Gardner's excavations. It was uncertain then whether the sherds came from Naukratis or Tell Dafana, a site in the eastern Nile Delta that was excavated by Petrie in 1886. Petrie wrote that he found only one sherd of Chian ware at Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888 62), which he described as a plain piece, thus the Chian sherds in the Reading collection come from Naukratis.
