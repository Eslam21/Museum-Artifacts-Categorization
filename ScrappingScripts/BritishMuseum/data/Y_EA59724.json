Roughly rectangular in form with one rounded end. The squared end, one long side and part of the rounded end were intentionally ground to shape. The thickeness of the slab is due to natural cleavage. There is no evidence of artificial thining or smoothing. Satin spar naturally occurs around the edges of one side, creating a raised frame 2-3mm thick.
