This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " For parallels regarding the female figure, see British Museum 1888,0601.481. According to Lemos, the female figure is a representation of Athena but there are no features depicted that are specific to Athena. Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Group of Worshippers from the Chalice Style. The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which bears the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Chalice Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Chalice Style group display a mixture of techniques, which consists of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women.
