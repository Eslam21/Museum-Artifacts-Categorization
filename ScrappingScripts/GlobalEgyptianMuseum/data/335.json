The first comprises the defensive extremities of  hippopotamus and elephant generally decorated with geometric motifs. These were hollowed out in order to contain the malachite used to produce make-up.The second group is found in tombs, always as a pair of horns, of which one was hollowed out and one was full. Their exact function is not known but it could be a symbol of fecundity represented by a masculine and feminine element. The third category is formed by tusks with a figurative decoration like this example from the Brussels Museum. It shows a bearded man of whom only the head has been detailed (compare E.2331B)."}
