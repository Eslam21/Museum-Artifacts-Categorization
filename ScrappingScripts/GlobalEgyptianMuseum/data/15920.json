{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 5934", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "COLOSSUS", "Material": "PORPHYRY", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Name": "Colossus of Emperor Diocletian", "Description": "The colossal statue of the seated Roman Emperor Diocletian is sculpted in red porphyry, a rock of feldspar crystals embedded in a compact dark red or purple groundmass.It is entirely polished, which indicates that the statue was exhibited in a square. The head, arms, feet, and lower part of the throne are missing, which made the identification of this person very difficult.The missing head was slightly tilted to the left and the hands were likely holding emblems, symbolic objects used as an identifying mark. The ornaments of the throne imitate precious stones and are in rectangular, oval, and lozenge shapes. The emperor wears a toga and a long-sleeved chiton, or a long garment."}
