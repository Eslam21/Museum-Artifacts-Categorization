Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Scaraboids in the shape of a Black African head are a standard production at Naukratis. Petrie listed a number of variants for Black African head scaraboid\u2019s moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 8-11). Gorton, A.
