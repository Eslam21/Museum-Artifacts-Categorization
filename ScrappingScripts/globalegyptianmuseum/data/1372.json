{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7699", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "20 cm", "Width": "14 cm", "Name": "Royal face of the 18th Dynasty", "Description": "This fragment of a statue represents a royal face with some remains of a nemes and the uraeus. The feminine traits could indicate that it is a statue of queen Hatshepsut. Nevertheless, the face also resembles that of a seated statue of Amenophis II which was found before the VIth pylon in the temple of Amun at Karnak and a bust of the same king preserved at the Louvre (E.13889). It remains therefore difficult to determine the identity of the royal person represented."}
