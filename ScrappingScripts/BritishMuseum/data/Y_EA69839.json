{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA69839"], "Description": [" A souvenir flask. On side (a), within a border of studs, St Menas stands to front, his arms outstretched in blessing. Above each arm, separated by the head, is the inscription. His hair is smooth, but was perhaps curly in the archetype: the flask has come from the mould with blurred detail. He wears a short tunic and a long cloak, and possibly has high boots. He is flanked by camels. On side (b) Saint Thekla stands to front, bound, between two bulls looking back at her and two hounds (or a hound and a bear). She has hair to her shoulders and drapery falling to the ground. Orange clay, with a buff surface over large areas.
