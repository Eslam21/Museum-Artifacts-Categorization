Redief is seated upright on a cube-shaped stool which is inscribed on the front. His only garment is a short kilt. His head is inclined slightly to the side. His hair is cropped short, but in an earlier phase the head had a curly wig which was later removed. Traces of this change are still visible on the back of the head. The left hand lies flat on the upper thigh, the right hand is fisted around a stone core, and is held upright on the thigh."}
