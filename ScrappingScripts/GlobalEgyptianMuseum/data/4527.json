{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "1017", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD (not before); PTOLEMAIC PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTOR'S MODEL", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF", "Height": "10.5 cm", "Width": "10.435 cm", "Depth": "1.8 cm", "Name": "Sculptor's model with relief of falcon", "Description": "Square slab of fine limestone, well polished on both sides. The front depicts the hieroglyph of a standing falcon in raised relief. A band of ten squares runs along the lower part of the surface, the remains of the original grid. On the upper left edge is a protrusion at right angles, revealing the original thickness of the slab. The background has been smoothed evenly and tiny traces of the polishing can still be seen, parallel to the contour of the reliefs. The falcon was meticulously executed. On the other side, a 10 x 10 square grid and three concentric circles were incised using a compass."}
