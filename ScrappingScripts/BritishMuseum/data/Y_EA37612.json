{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37612"], "Description": [" A man's face, possibly a portrait, apparently broken from a terracotta figure, but perhaps from a flask. The hair is close-cropped and side-whiskers join under the chin. It appears to be a product of a two-piece mould, but the edge, where it is unbroken, seems to be finished, rather than a separated join (but such edges can be deceptive). Micaceous brown-grey Nile silt (fired in a reducing atmosphere), with a black slip (Memphis Black Ware).
