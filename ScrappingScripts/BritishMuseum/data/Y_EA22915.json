At the top is a curved sky-sign above a winged sun-disk with pendent uraei. The top and middle registers are divided by a multi-coloured border. The middle register comprises two scenes back to back under a sky-sign. On the right Besenmut in a leopard-skin over a white skirt adores Ra-Horakhty, who stands behind an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. On the left the deceased adores Atum who stands behind a similar altar. The third section of the stela consists of six lines of text divided in the middle into a prayer to Ra-Harakhty on the right and a prayer to Atum on the left on behalf of the prophet of Montu, Besenmut, son of the prophet of Montu Nespasefy and the lady Irtyru. The stela is cracked part way down the front and damaged on the top left side. The edges are chipped with loss to some text. The background of the stela is white. The sky-sign at the top is blue. The disk is red with pink uraei who have blue heads and a red and white crown edged in black respectively. The upper wings are blue with a pink patch streaked in blue; while the lower wings are green edged in red. The hieroglyphs are blue and red. There is a large multicoloured border consisting of green, pink, blue, and red rectangles separated by two white and one black stripe and edged in green. In the middle register the sky-sign is blue and the hieroglyphs are black on a pink background separated by blue lines.
