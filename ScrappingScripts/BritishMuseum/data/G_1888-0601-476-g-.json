Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
