Amelineau at Abydos. It belongs to the type of vessel which the kings gave in offering to the gods and to the sanctuaries during specific festivals. The back of the dish bears several hieroglyphic signs which are the same as those of a dish in green schist found in the step pyramid of Saqqarah. In view of the absence of any royal name, it is very difficult to precisely date this fragment."}
