It is interesting to note that, while the tile is green, the unbroken edge displays a light blue colour. Precisely what this tile decorated at Abydos is unknown because no tiles have been found in situ, but it is quite likely that the walls of the sanctuary and nearby shrines were decorated in the same manner as the niches of Djoser's funerary complex.
