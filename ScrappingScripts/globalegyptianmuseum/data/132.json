{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.0578", "Dating": "1ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UMM EL-GA`AB/UMM EL-QA`AB", "Category": "DISH", "Material": "GREYWACKE", "Technique": "POLISHED; HEWN; ENGRAVED", "Width": "14.2 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a decoration cut in relief", "Description": "The fragments are very thin and lightly curved, which signifies that they are not from a palette but clearly from a very flat bowl, decorated on the inside. The decor could not be reconstructed in its entirety, but one can distinguish a being who presents more human than animal characteristics.  It is probably the beetle named coleoptere \"Agrypnus notodonta\". One finds it on several protodynastic documents as an animal sacred to the goddess Neith. The insect has a was-sceptre in its right 'hand'."}
