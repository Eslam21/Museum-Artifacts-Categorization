", " '101' written on the back in pencil, appears to be a Gutch number for a 'mostly figure heads with wreaths' (in Hogarth 1899, p.84, no.101). Three fragments from the same mould series known from Naukratis (Oxford Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4696; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA573, NA670; Gutch 1899, p.84, no.101) and probably made at the Naukratis Terracottas workshop that was operational from the 3rd to 2nd century BC and possibly later. Similar to Naukratis figurines now at Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA681, NA683) and the British Museum (GR1886,0401.1415, Bailey 2008, 65-6, no. 3187). Similar style and headdress to Memphis example dated to the 3rd century BC (Petrie 1909, pl.39, no. 36), and now in the British Museum is dated to the 3rd or 2nd century BC (Bailey 2008, no. 3152). Parallels from Alexandria dated to the Ptolemaic period (Besques 1992, no. D/E 4572) and 2nd to 1st century BC (Fischer 1994, 234-5, pl.46, nos 469-473).
