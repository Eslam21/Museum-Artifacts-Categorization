Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88) The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 52, no. 274) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.714) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.265"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 31 Jan 1994"]}
