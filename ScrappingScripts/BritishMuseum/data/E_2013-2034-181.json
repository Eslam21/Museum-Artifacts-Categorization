The engraving shows the pecked figures of a cow, an unidentified quadruped animal (mythical?), and an unidentified shape, made clearer by the pecking removing grey patina to reveal an orange hue below. The cow figure is to the right, facing left with long upcurved horns that meet in the middle and is not infilled but for a chevron of pecked coat pattern marking on the rump. To the lower left of the cow is the infilled figure of an animal with four legs and a long tail, but no apparent head and neck and a pecked thin protuberance from the shoulder (mythical?). Above this is an unidentified pecked swirl shape. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.
