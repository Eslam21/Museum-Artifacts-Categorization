The standing position against little or no background setting is a characteristic of all five prints, but although this drawing is of a similar format, it is not necessarily connected with the series. It is considerably smaller (about 88 X 52 mm, as against approximately117 X 74 mm for the engravings) and has little indication of the bulk of the drapery which is a feature of the engraved figures. Nor is it connected with D\u00fcrer's later engraving of St Anthony of 1519 (Meder 51) which shows the saint seated with the addition of an elaborate landscape background, taken from his earlier pen and ink drawing \u2018Pupila Augusta\u2019 (The Royal Collection, Windsor Castel; Winkler, \u2018D\u00fcrer\u2019, i, pl. 153). The Tietzes and Panofsky had reservations about the attribution of this lightly-sketched drawing, but it is of a fine enough quality to be by D\u00fcrer and should be dated c. 1514 -15. Lit from J.
