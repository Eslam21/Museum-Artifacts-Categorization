", " East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of early Classical Greek date (broadly 500BC to 425BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Very similar, but different mould series, fragments from at least two protomes that were found at Naukratis (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA350 joins NA355; NA354 joins NA353; NA390 joins NA850, NA426, NA802, NA803 and NA509) and parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.120, no.2525, Type B2, same mould as above Naukratis examples) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 238, GR1885, 1213.41, same mould as above Naukratis examples). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the early and late 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
