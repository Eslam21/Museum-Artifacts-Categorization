{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:255", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "TILE", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "2.2 cm", "Depth": "1.2 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a faience tile", "Description": "Square segment of a blue-glazed faience tile, recalling late 18th Dynasty palace production. In the absence of archaeological context, its interest lies in the date of acquisition, as part of the collection of antiquities formed by Lady Harriet Kavanagh. Her collection with its inventory provides a rare example of a well-documented private group of materials from the 1840s. In this context the date of this tile is uncertain: the palace sites were not uncovered until late in the 19th century. However, if not very much later in date, the fragment may derive from an item of burial equipment, from a tomb of high status."}
