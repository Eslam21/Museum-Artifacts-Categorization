{"artifact_name": "textile; mummy-wrapping", "Object Type": [" textile ", " mummy-wrapping "], "Museum number": ["EA75992"], "Description": [" Large textile fragment; linen, medium-coarse quality, undyed but now buff-coloured with grey-brown stains (oily). Along one side, the remains of a plain selvedge. Across one end, a torn edge following a self-band. Remains of opposite end also torn. Very ragged and worn, but shows no signs of darning or other repairs. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.25 ends per 10mm and weft c.8-9 picks per 10mm. This probably came from the inner layers of a mummy wrapping. Wear suggests that its previous use was probably as a garment and the size suggests it could be half a tunic, but there is no sign of sewing at the selvedge, although the selvedge is itself characteristically worn.
