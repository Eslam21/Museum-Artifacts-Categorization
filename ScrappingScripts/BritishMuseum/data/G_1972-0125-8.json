Harpokrates seated on the ground, his legs extending to his right, upon a curve-fronted plain plinth. He wears a long chiton with short sleeves, and his large phallus emerges from its hem to rest on the ground between his feet. His hair is long and wavy and there is a hint of a side-lock resting on his right shoulder. Two lotus buds are placed at the top of his head and flank a Double Crown, now broken. He holds a pot to his left hip and places his right hand into its mouth. The back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with traces, mainly on the front, of a white dressing.
