He is dressed in a long kilt  and wears a false beard in the form of a truncated cone. The head, wearing a striated wig, is distinguished by a finely sculpted face, following the example of the idealised statuary of the reign of the first Saite pharaoh. The image of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris carved on the kilt of the general constitutes a decorative element characteristic of the 26th Dynasty."}
