These show scenes of animals, most often cats and mice, using both parody and role inversion. Their composition is inspired by funerary scenes and temple reliefs. On these satirical ostraca, cats play the role of servants of a lady mouse. This example from the Brussels museum shows a lady mouse sitting in front of a table of offerings, smelling the fragrance of a lotus flower which she holds in her left hand. On the other side of the table is a cat, standing on its back legs holding a fan."}
