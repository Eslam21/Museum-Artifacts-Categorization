{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 28488", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "CYMBAL", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Width": "8.3 cm", "Name": "Pair of Cymbals", "Description": "The model of these cymbals is visibly different from other models. The rims of these cymbals are relatively larger and the central calotte is less convex than that of other instruments, which is the reason they produce a muffled sound. Cymbals are still used in Egypt, by belly dancers, who hold them in a very special way. They attach the cymbals to their hands, with a thread that passes through a hole in the center of each cymbal and round their fingers."}
