{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1516"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Neferhotep: there are two registers on the face of this round-topped stela. In the upper register Amenhotep I and Queen Ahmose-Nefertari are seated on thrones facing an altar on which rests a water-pot and a floral bouquet. The figures and the accompanying text are all carved in raised relief. In the lower register the foreman Neferhotep, son of the foreman Nb-nfr, is shown on the left kneeling with arms raised in adoration. His figure is carved in sunk relief and the text in the lower register, consisting of a prayer to Amenhotep I and Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, is incised. The stela is broken along the right and bottom edges with some loss. There are two gouges in the upper register and the surface is cracked in places. There are traces of red paint on the bodies of the figures, the bouquet and the lines between the hieroglyphs.
