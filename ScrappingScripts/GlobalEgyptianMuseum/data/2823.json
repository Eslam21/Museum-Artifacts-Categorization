{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:159", "Dating": "3RD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED; CARVED", "Height": "2.5 cm", "Width": "4.2 cm", "Name": "Wooden scarab", "Description": "Wooden scarab with longitudinal boring for stringing. The workmanship of the upper side is fine, but the hieroglyphs on the underside give no connected sense, and the hole drilled through the body is a feature of small, not of large scarabs. The scarab may be an ancient burial item, to protect the heart, but adapted in modern times for sale. The hieroglyphs are quite competently executed, surprisingly accurate for the time of acquisition, mid-1840s."}
