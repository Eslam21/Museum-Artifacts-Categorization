{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA43132"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone head of a male figure, the right side of the face now lost. He has a tonsure hairstyle of wavy curls around the side of the head and partly covering his left ear, while the top of the head is bald. His brow is deep set. The inner corner of his left eye is intact, while his right eye has been heavily damaged with a number of abrasions to the pupil area and around the edges. The remaining outline of his nose suggests it was broad in shape, and his mouth is wide with thick, fleshy lips. His lips are pursed together and sharply incised around the edge, while the outer corners of his mouth are relaxed. His chin appears to be raised, suggesting an upwards gaze. There are numerous chips and thin scratches to the surface which obscures details of the facial features. A large portion of the top of the head is missing.

A photograph of the object taken during the excavations is available online via the Egypt Exploration Society's Flickr page: https://www.flickr.com/photos/egyptexplorationsociety/25113678908/in/album-72157663539521818/ It has been argued that this head likely originally belonged to a block statue based on the raised head and angled neck, as well as the apparent attachment of the chin and lower neck area to another area of stone (Russmann 2001). This distinctive hairstyle is associated with a group of priests associated with a cult of Hathor and collectively referred to as the \u2018Bald Ones of Hathor\u2019 (Cl\u00e8re 1995). Some attestations of \u2018bald-headed ones\u2019 are noted within the 18th Dynasty, but these figures are more typically dated within the early 19th Dynasty. Further Bibliography: J-J.
