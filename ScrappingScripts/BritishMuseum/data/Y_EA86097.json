{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA86097"], "Description": [" Fragment of a vessel made of calcite. The base is flat and at a height of 0.6 a circumferential indentation defines the edge. The body is tapered towards the base with the maximum diameter at the shoulders at which the vessel is broken off. An area at the shoulder is visible where a handle is broken off. The handle had a width of 1.3 and a height of 0.8 cm. The upper part of the vessel is not preserved. There is a partially smoothed edge at the top edge where the vessel is broken off. This seems to be traces of reuse, maybe for polishing or other use.
