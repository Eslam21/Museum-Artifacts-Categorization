{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "ACO.Tx.2470", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-SHEIKH `ABADA/ANTINOOPOLIS", "Category": "COPTIC TEXTILE", "Material": "FLAX; WOOL", "Technique": "WOVEN", "Height": "177 cm", "Width": "124 cm", "Name": "Piece of cloth of Colluthus and Tiso\u00efa", "Description": "This piece of cloth was discovered in the tomb of Aurelius Colluthus and his wife Tiso\u00efa, situated in the necropolis of Akhmim. It was wrapped around the body of the deceased. The decoration on this cloth is divided into two superimposed registers delimited by the fa\u00e7ade of a building with several stories with two arches at the top resting on short columns.  Within the arcades are a man with a nimbus holding a cup in one hand and a woman wearing a tunic with clavi. The second register consists of two columns and a panel made up of a geometric grid of intertwined lozenges with stylized vegetal motifs. This cloth, which fits into the general pattern of winding sheets from the Roman Period, is probably a hanging reused in a funerary context. Identification of the two people with the deceased couple is uncertain; the scene may be an allusion to Dionysius."}
