The polish on the back of the comb is superior to the polish on the teeth. The back is reinforced by four knots that at the same time enabled it to be easily held. Museums around the globe have important collections of wooden combs dating to several dynasties. Some models are still in use today, for example the double combs, which have two rows of teeth of different sizes on each side of the back, to comb different kinds of hair."}
