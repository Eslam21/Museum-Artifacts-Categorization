An upper part broken from the front mould for a man, standing with his arms to his sides: he is lost from the waist down. He has a bald head, wrinkled forehead, heavy eyebrows and thickened lips, the lower one rather twisted as well as a broken nose. His ears are set high. Although he does not wear a topknot, he seems to be a boxer, as what are probably the upper thongs of a sphaira or caestus (a boxing-glove) appear on the impression\u2019s left arm; the right arm also has a tiny area that may be part of such a thong. Probably part of a two-piece set of moulds. Brown Nile silt with a thick grey core, common fine gold mica and white inclusions.
