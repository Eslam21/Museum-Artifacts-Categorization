Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, of Type A1 dated \u2018late Archaic\u2019, after 525 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.116, nos 2463 and 2465) and in Ephasus (Higgins 1970, no. 546). A number of fragments from the same type of protome may come from the same piece (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA452, NA761 and possibly NA831; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.8.1899; British Museum GR 2011, 5009.275). Similar protomes were found in Samos is dated to the third quarter of the 6th century BC (Tsakos 2007, 194, pl.26.2) and from Olynthus dated 6th century BC (Robinson 1952, 73-4, pl.1-3, nos 1-2). Falls into Croissant's 'Aeolis' and 'Clazomenae' types dated between 540 and 510 BC (Croissant 1983,164 nos 82-3 and 95-107, Types F4 and G3).
