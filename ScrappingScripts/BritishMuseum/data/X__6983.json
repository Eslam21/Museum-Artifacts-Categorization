", " Naturalistic limestone figures of nude female. Rare at Naukratis, with both high quality (British Museum 1886,0401.1394) and poor quality examples (Oxford AN1896-1908-G.1036, Amsterdam, Allard Pierson Museum 7936) and another piece attributed to Naukratis (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum E.SU.147). One exceptional example was found in a \u2018Ptolemaic\u2019 context in the casemate structure of the Great Temenos (Petrie 1886, 33; British Museum EA1886,0401.1394), though also dated to the Saite period (Edwards 1885, 278). The style, though fine and naturalistic, does have exaggerated long fingers and round breasts, not distinctive of the early Ptolemaic Period material produced in contemporary terracotta figures. Like the terracotta versions, this may represent a later (Ptolemaic) three dimensional variant that evolved from (Late Period) flat votive plaques. Parallels from Memphis (Thomas & Nicholson 2013, 62, P-68), Saqq\u00e2ra (Martin 1981, no.406) and Tell el Barud (Petrie Museum UC60120) are of 4th and 3rd century BC date.
