{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "100", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENT", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; PAINTED", "Height": "27 cm", "Width": "24.5 cm", "Depth": "5.7 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "Rectangular stela with irregular sides. The scenes and texts are applied in paint. The decorated section is surrounded by a simple border. The two registers are separated by a band c. 4.5 mm wide. Outlines and details are all done in black paint. The representations show four colours: male skin red-brown, female skin yellow, hair and lappets black, clothing white. The paint sometimes crosses the outlines. The inscription starts in hieroglyphs but by the end of the first line has turned into hieratic. Just as in the representations, the ink has deteriorated in places, making it difficult to read the text."}
