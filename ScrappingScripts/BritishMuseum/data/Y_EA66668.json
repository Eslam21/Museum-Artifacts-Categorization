The lintel and jambs are incised with the full titulary of Ramesses IV. The main stela is divided into two principal sections. At the top the king on the left offers Maat to Horus, Lord of Buhen, who flourishes a hp\u0161-sword, Isis and Bastet. Six lines of text contain a prayer for Ramesses IV. In the lower register the king's cartouches are carved on the right, while on the left the viceroy kneels in adoration. Before him are four columns of text with a hymn to the king by the viceroy of Kush Hori, son of Hori, son of Kama. The stela has been broken into several fragments which have been joined together, but parts of the centre, upper left and top are lost. The surviving pieces are worn in places, especially the upper right jamb. There are no traces of colour.
