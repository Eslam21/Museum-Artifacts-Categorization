{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 70164", "Dating": "1ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "INLAY", "Diameter": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Disk with Scene of Dogs Hunting Gazelles", "Description": "On the convex side of the disk there is a hunting scene. A dog tracks a gazelle and then attacks and bites its neck. The figures are enhanced by a skillful contrast of colors. One of the dogs and the horns and hooves of the gazelles are carved from the soapstone disk itself. The second dog and the bodies of the two gazelles are inlaid in pink-veined alabaster. Other decorated spinning disks like this one were found in an open wooden box in Hemaka's tomb. They were apparently intended for use as small spinning tops. A stick was inserted in the hole through the center of the disk. When the disk is turned, it creates a scene of dogs chasing gazelles."}
