Finally, during the reign of Trajan, it was cut into three parts and reused in the foundation of a Roman temple. The scene on the column depicts Ramesses the Second. The scene is protected at the top by a falcon grasping the Shen sign of eternal power in its talons. The king is shown offering flowers in the temple. He wears the Khepresh crown of ceremonies with a cobra on the forehead for protection, a ceremonial dress with a transparent upper garment, and a kilt. His neck is adorned with a wide necklace with twisted decorations. The cartouches and titles of Ramesses the Second are written under the outstretched right wing of the falcon. The cartouches and titles of Tuthmosis the Fourth are written in a column and painted in yellow on the other side of the scene."}
