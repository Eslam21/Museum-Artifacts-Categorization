", " Five similar, rather course mould-made or handmade and solid bird figurines were found at Naukratis (Boston MFA 86.382, 86.383, 86.384, 86.475, 86.489). See 'Roman' Egyptian parallels (Dunand 1990, no. 898-900, 904), also known from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC48344, dated 'Late Roman'). Examples with a secure archaeological Late Roman context (Bailey 2008, 3731) are different in style and decoration. The fabric and style is consistent with other Late Period figurines from Naukratis. Also Attic parallels, which this may copy, have been dated to the mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1970, nos 692-5). Parallel from Kamiros, Rhodes (Jacopi 1930, fig. 89). Dunand, F. 1990.
