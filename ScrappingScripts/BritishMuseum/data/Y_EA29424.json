{"artifact_name": "writing-tablet", "Object Type": ["writing-tablet"], "Museum number": ["EA29424"], "Description": [" Rectangular wooden writing-board,two holes for a cord binding appear on its left side (when viewing the front). The board was thus once, or intended to be, part of a codex, but its current state appears to reflect secondary use. This is suggested by the edge opposite the binding holes, which is noticeably uneven and largely unfinished; it was likely the result of a break. Despite the loss of material, however, no text appears to be missing, implying that the writing postdates the break. Evidence for the board\u2019s prior use may lie in traces of ink and in the possible presence of notching on the edge closer to the binding holes. Both sides were whitened in preparation for writing, and save for the bottom fifth of its back, the board is filled with text. This is written in black ink, a rather legible greek semi-cursive of the Roman period that was misidentified as \u201cCoptic\u201d in earlier Museum records. The front bears 65 lines of text; the back, 45. The text seems best described as memoranda for a collector or an aide-m\u00e9moire.
