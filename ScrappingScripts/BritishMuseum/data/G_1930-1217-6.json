{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1930,1217.6"], "Description": [" Head of terracotta male figure wearing wreath. The head and neck of a male celebrant, broken from a figure. He has a strongly modelled face and wears ball earrings. A tightly woven and bound wreath is worn, fronted by an additional wreath of pointed leaves and buds: the leaves may be of ivy, the buds are possibly olives or nuts. A ribbon or garland curves down from the woven wreath and crosses the man\u2019s brow. There is no indication of hair, except for a lock falling from below the wreath behind the ear on the right side: that on the left side is lost with no certain trace. The back is plain. The head, which is hollow, appears to have been made in a two-piece mould and attached to a separately produced body. The wreaths, the ribbon and the lock of hair were all handmade and applied after the head left the mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt with a grey core. The front is covered with a white dressing and substantial traces of colour are preserved. The flesh is painted orange-pink and black paint is used on the side-lock; the leaves of the front wreath have areas of blue paint, while the woven wreath is pink and its bindings (not modelled in the clay) are painted blue-grey.
