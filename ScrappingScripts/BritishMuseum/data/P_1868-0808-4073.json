G. Stephens, Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum ... Political and Personal Satires, III(2), 1877, p.1175: An etching between two columns of engraved text. In the former George II., clothed in sackcloth, sits in a gateway, lamenting. His daughter Dinah, i. e., Hanover, approaches, nearly naked, and complains that pitiless miscreants, the French, the disturbers of the whole world, firebrands of the Devil, the fuel with which Satan is to light the fire to burn the Wicked at the Last Day, had destroyed all the corn and potatoes, left not a turnip in the ground, taken all that was Dinah's own, and whatever she had received from the king, which he well knew was very considerable. She begs him to send his mighty warriors to her aid. And he sent them forth, \" even all that He could spare, to the Number of OOOOOl\". i. e., the Duke of Cumberland. Beneath, are the inscriptions \" Parvi sunt Arma foris nisi est Concilium domi,\" and \" Cato nondum finitae orationi solitus est aducere - Delenda est Carthago !\" The French threatened to appropriate Hanover, to protect which the Duke of Cumberland was put in command of an army. He was defeated, and the Convention of Closter-Seven was the result, whereby 38,000 Hessians and Hano- verians were disbanded.
