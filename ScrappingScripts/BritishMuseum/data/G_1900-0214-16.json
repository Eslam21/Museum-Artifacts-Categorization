Just south of the southern wall of this small chamber and at a similar level occurred the lamp with Dioscuri dedication (No. 57); and south again of this, up to the line of the E.-W. enclosure wall, were found (scattered partly on the surface in sebakh-diggers' and rubbish heaps, partly a foot or two above the mud) a few dedications to Herakles (Nos. 33, 84), mixed with stray sherds of Apollo (No. 52), Artemis? (No. 65), and others not to be identified, including the inscribed stone horse (No. 58), which like two other horses found by the sebakh-diggers close to this same point, lay in untouched earth almost immediately upon the mud.\" (Hogarth et al. 1898-9, p. 30)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Edgar 1898/1899 / Excavations at Naukratis.
