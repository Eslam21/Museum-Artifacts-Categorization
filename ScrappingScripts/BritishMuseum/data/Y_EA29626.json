{"artifact_name": "heart-scarab; necklace", "Object Type": [" heart-scarab ", " necklace "], "Museum number": ["EA29626"], "Description": [" Heart scarab with gold ring necklace: the basalt heart scarab is carved in high relief and squats on an oval base. Its legs are marked to indicate feathering, the wing cases are striated, the prothorax speckled and the head carefully rendered. The underside of the base is incised with a hieroglyphic text, a version of Chapter 30B of the 'Book of the Dead', the so-called heart scarab formula. The space where the deceased owner's name should appear has been left blank, proof that the scarab was not manufactured for a specific burial, but purchased from stock by the eventual owner. Gold foil has been wrapped around the tube for suspension that is at the top of the base on which the scarab sits; the ridged edge of the base itself is also wrapped in foil. The neck ring to which the scarab was meant to be attached is made from gold foil wrapped around a bronze core. At one end it is shaped to resemble a snake's head with a ring below into which the pointed other end was meant to pass in order to close the piece.
