Ancient traditions refer to the son of the deceased who was responsible for continually providing his deceased parents with offerings. Later, priests were often charged with taking care of the offerings and rituals. In the event that real offerings were not presented to the deceased, they could be replaced by models of food. By means of magic, the deceased would then be supplied for eternity."}
