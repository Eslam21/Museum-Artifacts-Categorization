{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7416", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH ?", "Category": "FURNITURE ELEMENT", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED", "Height": "68 cm", "Name": "Two legs of furniture", "Description": "These two legs of furniture both take the form of the god Bes: the first one holds his short arms alongside his body, the second plays a double flute. The colours are very well preserved: the flesh is blue, the beard green, the tongue red and the clothes yellow. Seven wooden pins are enforced in either the right or left flank of the figures. In the back, a rectangular mortise has been made to take a piece of wood. The mass which surmounts the skull and which represents the hairstyle tapers off. The two pieces were probably part of a bed or a stool."}
