{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Yellowish-white head of a female llimestone figure. Only the head, broken into many individual parts, is preserved. Particularly parts from the back and the top are missing. Smaller areas chipped; the tip of the nose is missing. The face is oval in shape with very large eyes whose outer edges are reaching far into the temples. The nose broadens towards the tip; the mouth is very broad with slim lips and smiles slightly. It is almost worked by means of a groove and the lips are hardly protruding. The chin is sturdy. The figure wears a headscarf with a diadem-like addition which is only separated from the forehead by means of a small dent. The ears are decorated with ear-caps and earrings. The back is flat.
