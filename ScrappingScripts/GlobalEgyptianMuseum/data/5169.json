Unlike the later offering basins, these offering tables were not always placed inside the tomb superstructure in front of the false door, at the spot where the offering actually took place, but at least during the first three dynasties were placed in the subterranean parts of the tomb, in the sarcophagus chamber itself or in the storerooms beside it as well. Representations of round table in offering scenes similar to this example are known on cylinder seals from as early as the 1st Dynasty."}
