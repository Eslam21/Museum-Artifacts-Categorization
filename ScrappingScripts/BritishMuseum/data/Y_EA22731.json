It copies a Minoan form but is decorated with seven registers each containing abstract designs derived from the ancient pharaonic Egyptian repertoire of motifs. The designs are represented in dark blue with black outlines on a pale blue ground that contrasts with the rhyton's unglazed interior.

Its popularity with scholars resides no doubt in its demonstration that ancient Egyptian craftsmen had fully absorbed a foreign pottery typology into their local Egyptian production. The cosmopolitan Egyptians of the New Kingdom, doubtless aware of the opulence of Minoan Crete, adopted as their own a vessel used there primarily for ritual purposes. It is not known, however, whether this rhyton was employed in Egypt for similar ceremonies because judging from its excellent state of preservation it came from a tomb. Bibliography: E. A.
