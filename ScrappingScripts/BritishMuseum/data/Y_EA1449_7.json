{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA14466"], "Description": [" Bronze standing figure of Khonsirdis: he is shown here as a priest with a shaven head and a leopard-skin vestment. In his proper left hand he holds the base of a statue that he supported with his right hand. That figure, made separately, is now lost but it was undoubtedly an image of Osiris. Khonsirdis's figure is covered with a wealth of incised detail, but apart from silver inlay in the eyes, there is apparently no evidence of precious metal inlays. On his proper right shoulder is a cartouche of Psamtek I and above his right breast a figure of Osiris in profile facing right. The leopard skin is here clearly an imitation, probably in cloth: the spots are shown as rows of circles, the \"paws\" are neatly fitted at the hips, and the tail hangs down behind. A band over the left shoulder, of a kind frequently represented on these vestments during the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Dynasties, gives Khonsirdis' names and titles and again names his king. Although his long kilt is elaborately pleated and has a stiffened front panel, it is narrow and relatively simple, more in the style of the Middle Kingdom than the New Kingdom. A narrow strip down the centre of the panel continues Khonsirdis' inscription, interrupted by a vignette that shows him worshiping Osiris. Thus the figure he held must have represented that god. Since there seems to have been relatively little modeling, as opposed to engraved detail, the figure's large navel and the trench-like depression leading down to it are very noticeable, though these details would have been largely hidden when the image of Osiris was in place. The figure's broad shoulders and long limbs increase the sense of monumentality in this large bronze.
