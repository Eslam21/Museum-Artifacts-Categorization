{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA92"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone naophorous statue of the male official Ankhpakherd. The figure is depicted in a standing position and wears a version of the \u2018Persian wrap\u2019 garment. This includes a visible strap over the left shoulder and a large knot of material tied at the centre of his chest, with a further strip of material falling down the right side of the torso and resembling the \u1ec9m\u021d\u1e2b hieroglyph sign. His elongated arms carry a tall and slim naos shrine with the image of the deity Khonspakherd, the child form of the Theban god Khonsu. The god wears a crown depicting two phases of the moon (a full moon disc and crescent moon) with a uraeus cobra placed on the forehead. He has the traditional sidelock of hair, and is depicted nude His arms are held by his side, with a small ankh sign held in the right hand. The base of the naos appears to merge with the figure\u2019s clothing. On the reverse the broad back-pillar features three vertical columns of inscribed text, the lower section of each line now missing. The front of the naos is also inscribed around the edges framing the image of Khonspakherd. In addition to the break at the neck and lower body, there are large gouges to the stone at borth elbows and notable chips across Ankhpakherd\u2019s body. The corners of the naos shrine are also broken off, particularly across the fa\u00e7ade at the top and the left side. Text from the left side and lower right side of the naos is also now lost due to damage. The rounded top of the back pillar is partially lost, and the bottom right corner of the back-pillar text is also damaged. The statue has been attached to a modern rectangular base.

The original provenance for this figure is uncertain (PM VIII), however the focus on the Theban triad Amun-Re, Mut, and Khonsu and the statue subject\u2019s name which is closely related to Khonspakherd may suggest that the statue was likely intended for a Theban site. It has been further hypothesised that since the evocation of Mut precedes the addressing of Khonspakherd, this could suggest that the statue may have been located within the Mut temple complex (Klotz 2009). Further discussion and an in-depth translation of the text can be found in Klotz 2009. Further Bibliography: K. Bosse, 1936.
