{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA58078"], "Description": [" Basalt striding male figure on a slim rectangular base. The figure wears a short cropped wig which is set high on the forehead and covers the ears. His eyes are rounded with a heavy upper eyelid, and the brow is indicated as a flat ridge. His nose is long and broad, and positioned close to the mouth which is small with thin, sharply incised lips. The outer corners of the mouth are upturned to suggest a slight smile. The neck is extremely broad. His upper body is bare, with faint modelling of the chest and abdomen. His arms are held by the sides of the body, and he holds a piece of folded cloth in both clenched fists. He wears a short shendyt kilt belted at the waist, with the beltline drooping slightly forward at the stomach and sitting higher on the waistline at the back. His left leg advances forward ahead of the right leg in a conventional striding position, and his legs are broad in size. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar extending to the neck of the figure, which appears to be uninscribed. The figure is in good condition with minimal damage to the figure or base.
