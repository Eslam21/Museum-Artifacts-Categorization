", " Ibex was a popular motif on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). Different versions of that motif are known (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXXVII, 15-19; Gardner 1888, Pl. XVIII, 10-13, 15). This scarabs belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 96-97, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A118-126). Note, however, that the motif on the underside is crudely incised, not stamped.
