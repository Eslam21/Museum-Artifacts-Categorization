The face is beige, but it was probably yellow, a colour reminiscent of that of gold. The eyebrows and the makeup line are gold-leafed and incised with a chevron pattern. The contour of the eyes and the iris are black. The grave expression of this mask is enhanced by the full and drooping lips. One hundred and seventy masks or fragments thereof were found in the necropolis of Mirgissa/Iken. The practice, attested from the end of the Old Kingdom, appears widespread here, though reserved for wealthy individuals. The conservation of the masks varies considerably, though several have been found almost intact. Although several masks with feminine features have been identified, most bear masculine traits. Some appear relatively stereotyped, but others have more individualised facial features and could potentially be real portraits. A variety of technical details suggests that these masks were actually made at Mirgissa/Iken, and this is confirmed by several archaeological observations."}
