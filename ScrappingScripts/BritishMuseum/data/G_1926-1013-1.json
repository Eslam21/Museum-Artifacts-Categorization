{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,1013.1"], "Description": [" Torso of terracotta figure of Aphrodite. The torso and upper legs of Aphrodite, modelled in the round, naked except for drapery that falls from the left shoulder. She stands leaning forward slightly, and inclined even more so to her right, producing a distinct crease at waist level on her right side. The breasts are not large, and a tiny twist of clay in the pubic area must be fortuitous on a female body: it does not represent male genitals and we do not have Hermaphrodite here. The buttocks are well rendered. Solid; probably hand-modelled. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with overall traces of a white dressing; some yellow paint survives on the flesh areas.
