{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.4782", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "CLEPSYDRA", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED", "Height": "11.5 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Fragment of clepsydra", "Description": "The clepsydra, originally designed to count the hours of the night, is a water clock that works in the same way as an hourglass. It is a stone basin that narrows towards the bottom where there is a hole for the water to run through. The water in a full basin would take all night to run dry. The inner surface was carved with twelve lines, each with eleven projections, one series for each month of the year. The eleven subdivisions were further apart during the winter months because the nights were longer. The Brussels fragment has a line of text on the outside recording the dual use of the instrument: \"To be able to know the hours of the day when Re cannot be seen, and to be able to know the hours of the night (when the stars cannot be seen).\" The inner surface of the fragment has traces of a was-sceptre and a djed-pillar."}
