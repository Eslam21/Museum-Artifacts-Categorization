{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37562"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Sarapis enthroned, with Harpokrates. There is some superficial damage but the figure is well preserved. This piece was manufactured in two separate halves, the back unmodelled. Sarapis seated on a throne, himation over his lower limbs and his upper body bare. He wears a reeded atef crown, with disc and twisted horns. He is bearded. A cornucopia is held in the crook of his left arm and he rests his right hand (which on more complete examples holds a small phiale) on the head of Harpokrates, who leans with his legs crossed against the arm of the throne. The details of Harpokrates are obscure and damaged, but he has his finger to his mouth and apparently has a shaven head with a side-lock. He also appears to be naked, except for a himation over his left shoulder. The throne has details of its construction on its top edge and its legs. Curved flat-fronted plinth. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt. Traces of a white dressing on the front. The atef crown and cornucopia are attributes commonly associated with the god Sarapis. The body is well modelled.
