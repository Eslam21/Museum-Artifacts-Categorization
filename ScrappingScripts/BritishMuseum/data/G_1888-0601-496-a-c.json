The later addition of British Museum 1924,1201.178 to the rest of the phallus cup led Williams to describe the vessel as belonging to one of the mature works of the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl (Williams 2006a, 128). The sherd 496c joins British Museum 1924,1201.178. The shape of the vessel suggests that the cup was probably a dedication to Aphrodite. For a discussion of the shape, see Williams, 2006a, pp. 127-8.
