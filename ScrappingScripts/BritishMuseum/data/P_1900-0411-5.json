An apparently early copy of Rembrandt's drawing in Berlin (Benesch 902), a work of the 1650s. Another copy is in Stockholm, and two further copies have been recorded.[2] NOTES: [1] Registered as 'School of' Rembrandt. A. E. Popham, writing in the introduction to the John Skippe sale catalogue (Christie's 20-21 Nov. 1958), notes that at least one ex-Skippe drawing was owned by Bateson and sold at the latter's sale, Sotheby's, 23 April, 1929, lot 26. The Bateson sale catalogue records that 22 other drawings were formerly in the Skippe collection, but as they do not bear his mark, Popham believed this provenance to be no more than conjectural. Yet Hind's mention of a Skippe provenance for the present sheet suggests that the connection may have been real, and that Bateson managed to acquire drawings from Skippe's heirs.
