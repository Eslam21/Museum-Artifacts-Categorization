", " According to Dupont and Thomas (2006, p. 79, NAU26), the geophysical characteristics of the fabric indicate that the sherd originated in Chios. The sample number is written in ink 'NAU 26' on break. Lions are usually depicted on Chalice style chalices seated facing right whilst sphinxes are seated facing left. Although Lemos does not specifically list this sherd in her fourth stage of the Group of the Simple Figures, the poor quality of the design on the exterior surface fits this grouping quite well. Figures portrayed on vases from this stage are poorly executed. Rim patterns and handle zones are disorderly. For parallels regarding the body shape and handle zone pattern, see Reading 26.2.62.
