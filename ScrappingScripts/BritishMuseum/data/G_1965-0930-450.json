The shape is also remotely reminiscent of Hera mugs and other Ionian mugs (see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405; cf. also Boston 88.930;Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.227.1899 and Boston 88.930). However, the relatively wide and flat rim is unusual for a drinking vessel.
