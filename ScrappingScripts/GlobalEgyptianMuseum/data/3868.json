{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "55.82.114", "Dating": "13TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "SHABTI COFFIN", "Material": "WOOD; PLASTER", "Technique": "PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "11.7 cm", "Width": "12.1 cm", "Name": "Model Coffin", "Description": "A miniature rectangular wooden coffin with vaulted lid and projecting end boards. It belongs to the 'seal bearer of the king and high steward, Nemtyemweskhet'. The wood was covered with a thick layer of fine plaster and painted yellow with the signs and eye-panel in blue. The coffin originally contained a shabti figure and acted as a dummy burial in a cenotaph tomb at Abydos, since presumably Nemtyemweskhet was actually buried near to the king. The only decoration on the coffin is a tiny eye panel within a rectangular frame."}
