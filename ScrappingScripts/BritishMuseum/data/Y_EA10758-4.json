{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10758,4"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum 5"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum 5, Frame 4. Papyrus written on the recto in linear hieroglyphic script. The recto contains medical prescriptions in red and black ink related to 'vessels', perhaps against stiffness. On the verso there are very short jottings. The text is written in vertical columns with titles in horizontal lines, in retrograde script. This frame contains lines 44-59. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
