{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["EA36342"], "Description": [" Monochrome circular bowl on solid circular base: the medium is dark-blue glass, barely translucent. There is no lip on the rim. The foot is solid save for a small cavity made by the mandril. The interior retains only slight traces of the core. Preserved intact, the entire exterior filmed grey making it impossible to determine if this surface was matt or glossy. Traces of core within.
