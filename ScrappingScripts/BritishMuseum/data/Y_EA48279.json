{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA48279"], "Description": [" Bronze lamp: elongated body and long, fluked, round-tipped nozzle. Circular wick-hole. The top is sunken within a rim extending round the body and nozzle. Nozzle-channel between the filling-hole and the wick-hole. The filling-hole is irregularly oval in shape. A crack in the top has been patched with two strips of bronze. At the rear is a double rod-handle, rising from leaf-shaped springs, curving up and forward to join below a leaf, and to separate, together with a central stem, eventually to terminate in an ivy-leaf-shaped handle-ornament. Undefined flat oval resting-surface. A rectangular patch cut from an ancient inscribed bronze plaque has been let into the rear below the handle-springs; it is incised with the letters HK. Other small areas have also been patched, particularly on top. A Greek inscription is pricked into the side of the lamp. On the right side are cut a few letters that are largely illegible, but also appear to give the name Apsalamos. Surface colouration: cleaned to bare metal and painted green before its acquisition by the Museum; the paint is now removed.
