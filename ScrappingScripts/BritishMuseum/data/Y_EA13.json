The composite creature combines the physical strength of the lion with the worldly might of the king, thus creating a creature with terrifying power. A hawk-headed sphinx, also called a gryphon, wearing a royal lappet head-dress, is often shown as a representation of the king treading on his enemies. The statue shown here and a similar one (EA.11) were set up near the Temple of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel. It is possible that this hawk-headed sphinx was intended to represent the king's powerful ability to defeat his enemies in the lands south of Egypt."], "Bibliographic references": [" Belzoni 1820 / Plates illustrative of the researches and operations of G Belzoni in Egypt and Nubia (pl. 43) ", " Porter and Moss 1951 / Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings 7: Nubia, the Deserts, and Outside Egypt.
