The 'Mayor' wears a French military coat and breeches, with a tricolour scarf and cocked hat with large tricolour plumes. He is otherwise naked, and a heavy chain of beads hangs from his ear. The 'Procureur' is naked except for a cocked hat and tricolour scarf; he carries a (?) goad as a staff of office. Behind his ear is a pen. 12 March 1799 Hand-coloured etching "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: James Gillray ", " Published by: Hannah Humphrey "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1799"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 253 millimetres ", " Width: 359 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VII, 1942) See BMSat 9355, &c.
