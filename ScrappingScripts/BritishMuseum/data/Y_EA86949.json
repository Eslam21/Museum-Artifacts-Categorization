{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86949"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows two coils of basketry on one side and three on the other suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. At the flat upper side two partly preserved impressions of the same oval scarab-like seal are visible. They show a circumferential line, at the bottom a nb-basket and above the head of a ram, facing towards the left, wearing a crown that is not very well visible but looks like a double feather crown. There are many finger impressions around the seal. Same motif can be found on EA86810 and EA86945.
