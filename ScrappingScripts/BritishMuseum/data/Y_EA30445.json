{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA30445"], "Description": [" A pottery flask with a flattened circular body decorated in relief: on each side is a narrow notched border. At the centre is a target covering the crossover point of 'straps' extending to the border. The 'straps' have ring-and-dot patterns divided by short double transverse lines. Below the mouth of the vessel is a pendent triangular 'necklace', with an ivy-leaf pendant, enclosing a simple palmette. The mouth is lost, together with most of both handles: they appear to have had grooved edges, and the lower springs are notched. Two non-functional bolster feet are placed at the bottom. On one side, adjacent to the 'necklace', are two letters of badly formed demotic, incised before firing. Two-piece mould. Micaceous dark-grey Nile silt, covered with a black slip (Memphis Black Ware). "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": [" 3rdC BC(late) (?) ", " 2ndC BC (?)
