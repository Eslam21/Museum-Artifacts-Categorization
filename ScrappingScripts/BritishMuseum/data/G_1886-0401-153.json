The lack of a rim or other diagonstic feature makes its impossible to confirm the cup shape. Type 5 and Type 8 cups are amongst the earliest South Ionian cups to appear at Naukratis and these are rare. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 and Type 9 cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 54, no. 1) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.100) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.153"]}
