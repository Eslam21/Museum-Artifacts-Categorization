{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 39210", "Dating": "SETHOS I/MENMAATRE", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "84 cm", "Width": "43 cm", "Name": "Group statue of Seti the First with Amun and Mut", "Description": "A group statue of Seti the First with Amun and Mut has suffered a great deal so that many parts of it are lost. It represents the divine couple, the god Amun and his wife the goddess Mut. Mut has the right arm round the back of her husband as a sign of affection. They are sitting together on their throne and between them is standing, on the base of the statue, King Seti the First represented as their son or the third member of the triad of Karnak, the god Khonsu. The statue of Seti the First is much smaller than the statues of the divine couple, in the same proportions as the statues of parents depicted with their children. Amun has lost much of his upper part: his traditional crown consisting of two ostrich feathers, as well as his right shoulder, arm, and hand; his legs and his feet, while the goddess Mut has lost her head and a large part of her torso. The face of Amun is not the original one but was replaced by a copy made in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Seti's statue has lost his head and his chest. He is represented standing with his left leg forward and wearing the starched royal kilt on which he has put his hands flat. His name is inscribed inside the cartouche on the base of the statue. The back of the statue of Amun and Mut is decorated with seven columns of hieroglyphics. The sides of the throne are decorated with the sema-tawi sign, symbolic of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, and represented by the papyrus and lotus flowers, the symbols of the two parts of Egypt, tied round the sign of wind pipe and lungs."}
