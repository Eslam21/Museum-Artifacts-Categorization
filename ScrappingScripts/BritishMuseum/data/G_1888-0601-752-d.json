Closest parallel for this fragmentary vessel is a mid 6th century BC example from Kamiros BM 1861,1024.5, originally thought to be of Rhodian origin, like this example (Higgins 1954: 46; 1959: 30-31). Higgins suggests this is from the same workshop BM 1861,1024.5. Same fabric as BM1888,0601.752a, BM1888,0601.752b and BM1888,0601.752c also from Naukratis. Jones' NAA analysis of BM1888,0601.752b places it within his Ionian B group (Jones 1986: 670).
