A bead net was possibly originally placed on top of the shroud (suggested by the presence of beads stuck in the textile). Head and neck - Mouth closed. Artificial eyes, probably made of composite materials, inserted on top of eye sockets filled with textile bundles. On the neck, two amulets (one in metal, the other in stone or faience) the shapes of which have not been identified yet. Brain has been removed through nasal passage, skull left almost completely empty; cheeks and mouth have been packed. Heavy dental wear, with the central incisors in the lower jaw missing peri-mortem or ante-mortem. A periapical cavity is present under the lower right second incisor and the lower left first molar has remodelling in the bone around its base possibly causing its relocation lingually either peri- or post-mortem. Chest and abdomen - Thorax and abdomen are almost completely filled with granular packing material, including a denser mass in the upper right zone of the thorax. Incision is visible on the left flank and the heart is still in place. Schmorl\u2019s nodes are seen in the 6th cervical and 4th, 6th and 9th thoracic vertebrae. Possible intervertebral disc disease in the superior surface of the 3rd lumbar vertebra. Arms - Extended. Hands with extended fingers converging over the pubic area. Legs - The legs are covered with packing material, some might contain organs.

The shroud was died in safflower, and was originally dark pink or red. Body wrapped into a bundle, with a thickness of 5cm of bandages over the chest. Arms and legs were not wrapped separately, but evidence of resinous material poured on the skin before wrapping. Pathological conditions: Schmorl\u2019s Nodes in neck (6th cervical) and torso (4th, 6th-9th thoracic), some periapical cavities under lower right second incisor and possibly lower left first molar.

Intrusion (human): No Intrusion (animal): No Scientific analysis: Yes \u2013 CT scan (obtained in 2014); FTIR and GC-MS of embalming residue Nestawedjat was the daughter of a man named Djedmutefankh and a woman named Djedasetesankh. They were probably members of one of the influential families who held high office in the Theban temple hierarchies during the period of Kushite rule over Egypt, but their precise place in society has yet to be determined. The mummy found in the coffins of Nestawedjat is the body of a woman and is very likely the remains of Nestawedjat. It was previously thought that the x-rays were showing that it is the body of a man and it had to be dated to the 21st Dynasty (about 1000BC). Bibliography: British Museum.
