{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1165"], "Description": [" Limestone false door of Bateti: this piece, which is unfinished, consists of a false door with a niche containing a figure in very high relief (almost a free-standing statue) of the deceased Bateti. The drum is inscribed and, in part, carved with the name of the deceased; the lintel carries no traces of text; the two jambs originally bore drawn representations of people, probably relatives, in attitudes of adoration or offering. On the right jamb can still be seen traces of three male figures; on the left are traces of two figures and a few hieroglyphic signs. The statue is moderately well carved. The niche is painted red and the figure in high relief has a black wig, red flesh, and yellow colour on the left flap of the loincloth. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 4th Dynasty (?) ", " 5th Dynasty (?)
