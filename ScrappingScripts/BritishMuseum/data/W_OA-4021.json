It was also accepted by Balog. The fig has its well-known pharmaceutical virtue as a laxative, but, fresh or dried, would be an unsuitable commodity to sell by measure. No other fig stamps have ever been identified and it is most unlikely that there should have been a short-lived policy to enforce such a method of selling figs - which from the number of pieces of this type would have had to have been in enormous demand. In fact, on a number of specimens, the end of the commodity is clear on the next line, leaving no doubt that it is right to read lil-zayt."], "Bibliographic references": ["Morton 1985 / A Catalogue of Early Islamic Glass Stamps (22)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["food/drink"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: \u1e24ayy\u0101n b.
