Petrie, Tanis ii, Nebesheh and Defenneh, p. 78 \u00a7 77: \"The scale armour (fig.19, 19a, 19b) is the most unusual find of all (...). The present example seems to have been a large part of a leather corslet, which was thrown away in the Greek vase chamber, No. 18; it was covered with scales of iron of the form shown in pl. xxxvii. 19b (...), which were originally about 1/100 of an inch thick; these scales were sewn on by six holes, each line of scales lapped over half the line below it so as to completely cover the stitching; and each scale lapped over two-thirds of the previous scale in the row; thus as each scale was out on the right-hand pair of holes was stitched through, going through the middle pair of the previous scale, and the left- hand pair of holes of the scale next before that. Thus the result was a mass three deep sideways and two deep from top to bottom, making the whole mass six scales thick at every part. The inner surface showing the stitching holes is given in fig. 19, and the outer surface at fig. 19a\".
