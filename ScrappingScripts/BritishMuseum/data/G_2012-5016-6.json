Such snails were also found at the Red Sea port of Myos Hormos and the quarry Mons Claudianus in Roman levels (Hamilton-Dyer 2011, 273). From Europe and not native to Egypt, Helix pomatia may have been introduced to the Nile (ibid. 272). Found in box of unregistered shells with other shells that had handwritten slips written by Petrie identifying the shell species and naming Naukratis as the provenance. These notes were presumably written in 1884-1885 when Petrie excavated at Naukratis, although they could have been written in 1885-1886, when he visited the site. Although not definitely from Naukratis, this is the most likely provenance."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (WC.13)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund (?)"], "Acquisition date": ["1886 (?)"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["2012,5016.6"]}
