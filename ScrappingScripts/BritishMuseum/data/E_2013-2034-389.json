This site has been referred to by TARA as Tana Adohn. ", " The massif of Tadrart Acacus, a vast mountainous region (more than 250 square km) which is today a desert, is situated in the Fezzan, to the east of the city of Ghat, bordering Algeria. The area is renowned for its diverse topography and landscape formations, from differently coloured sand dunes to arches, gorges, isolated rocks and deep ravines or wadis (dry river beds). Paintings and engravings of various styles are scattered throughout almost all the valleys. The landscape is particularly rich in rock art and was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 because of the significance of the rock paintings and engravings. Sporadically visited since the end of 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, the region became the subject of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, who also published the first scientific papers on its rock art (1961), including a monograph (1965). In the late 1930s Paolo Graziosi formulated some initial interpretative hypotheses. Since then, the research has expanded to include a systematic survey of the area and stratigraphic excavations of archaeological deposits. The Awis Valley is located on the east side of the Acacus Mountains. Although horses and chariots entered Egypt about 3,700 years ago, they were probably introduced to Central Sahara through the Libyan coast. It is unlikely chariots were driven across the Sahara, due to difficulties of dragging wheeled vehicles through sand and rocks; more likely the images held a symbolic power.
