{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 32472A- 32670", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "FAIENCE; GLAZE", "Technique": "FAYENCE", "Height": "21 cm", "Name": "Two Faience Shawabties", "Description": "Here am I, ready when you call.\" These words were said by the shawabties, or ushabties; both names are correct and mean \"he who answers.\" They are derived from the Egyptian verb \"ousheb\" meaning reply, because when the god Osiris calls them, they must reply and work. Their job is to plough the fields, to fill canals with water and to carry sand from west to east.The two shawabties are in the form of the mummy because they replace the deceased himself. They are almost identical and wear long tripartite wigs that leave the ears uncovered so they can hear the call of Osiris. A large number of shawabties was found in a box beside the mummy. The number of shawabties varies from tomb to tomb and depends on the status of the owner of the tomb. For example, there were 413 shawabties in King Tutankhamun's tomb"}
