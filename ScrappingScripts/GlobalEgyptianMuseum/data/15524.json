The ornament was made to be worn over a wig. This diadem is a gold band decorated with 15 rosettes and a cobra with inlays of carnelian, lapis lazuli, and green glass paste. The gold bands on the upper part of the diadem reproduced the two long plumes that were typical of royal and divine headdresses. The moving strips on either side of the face and at the back of the neck resemble the ornamental ribbons that were often applied to floral garlands."}
