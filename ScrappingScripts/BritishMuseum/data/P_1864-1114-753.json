Text from Bartrum 1995 Literature: Woltmann, II, p.191, 226; Hieronymus, 418; Hollstein, 50 This is one of Holbein's most original designs for a title-page and its high quality indicates that L\u00fctzelburger was responsible for cutting the block. Holbein has created an illusion of a sculptural monument in a Renaissance style; underneath is the suicide of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, represented before a tiny but evocative landscape. At left and right, the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius I (c.430-367) is shown looting treasures from statues of various gods in order to fund his building projects and a protracted war against Carthage (see Hieronymus, p. 453). Both monarchs exemplify an amoral lust for power, in contrast to the heroic deeds of the Romans so often seen in Holbein's designs for title-pages. The title-page first appeared in 'Paraphrasis in Evangelium secundum Ioannem', written by Erasmus and dedicated to the brother of the Emperor Charles V, Ferdinand of Austria (J. Froben, Basel, February 1523). It was probably Holbein's most popular title-page and was frequently copied, often with an additional border round the edge, which effectively destroys the illusion of space in the design. Hieronymus listed eight copies, most of which were done during the 1520s and 1530s, but which continued to appear in publications until the 1570s."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hollstein / German engravings, etchings and woodcuts c.1400-1700 (50) ", " Bartrum 1995 / German Renaissance Prints 1490-1550 (231) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 1995 Jun-Oct, BM, 'German Renaissance Prints, 1490-1550', no.231 "], "Subjects": [" ancient history ", " ornament "], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Cleopatra the Great ", " Representation of: Dionysius I, Syracuse "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Willis & Sotheran"], "Acquisition date": ["1864"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1864,1114.753"]}
