{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA1225"], "Description": [" Granodiorite kneeling figure of Nespaqashuty: this archaizing image combines elements from several previous periods. His elaborately detailed double wig and short chin beard have New Kingdom prototypes, most closely paralleled by wig and beard styles of the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. But his short, pleated kilt, frequently found on sculpture of the Old and Middle Kingdoms, was rarely represented on statues of the Eighteenth Dynasty and later New Kingdom, most of which are more elaborately costumed. Nespaqashuty's kneeling figure holds a symbol of the goddess Hathor in the form of a stylized sistrum, with the goddess' cow-eared face at the top of the handle. The inscription on the statue invokes, not Hathor, but the lesser goddess Nebethetepet, who was sometimes identified with Hathor. Nespakashuty's face on this statue is clearly no portrait, but neither is it archaizing. He has almond-shaped eyes and a sober expression. The base of statue and the sides of the sistrum are inscribed with hieroglyphs.

The bust and the lower part of this statue were acquired separately, in 1893 and 1897. Since the bust (on which Nespaqashuty's name does not appear) was believed to come from Thebes and the lower section had been acquired at Edfu, the fact that they belonged together was not recognized for some time. It is not entirely impossible that the statue came from a temple in Edfu. But since Nespaqashuty's other monuments are all from Thebes, it is far more likely that the lower half, already separated from the bust, was taken to Edfu by a nineteenth-century antiquities dealer.
