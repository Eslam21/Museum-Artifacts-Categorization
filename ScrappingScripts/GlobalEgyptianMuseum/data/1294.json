From the New Kingdom onwards, this insectivore has been associated with the ichneumon. The two animals were then tied to the \"dualistic\" nature of this \"god of the eyes\". They embodied respectively the nocturnal (Horus-Khentynirty) and diurnal (Horus-Khentyirty) aspect of the god. In the Late Period, the shrew was above all known by its bronze statuettes, mummies and even by sarcophagi."}
