", " Attached printed label states \u2018NAUKRATIS - Excavated and given by D.G. Hogarth 1903\u2019. Therefore this corresponds to the finds made in 1903 excavations and reported by Edgar (1905, 134): \u2018Amongst the faience objects from other parts of the site New Year bottles with necks in the form of lotus and papyrus were represented by numerous fragments\u2019. He appears to be suggesting that these finds are to be associated with the factory, but it is difficult to identify their place of discovery precisely. Petrie, who also mentioned \u2018necks of \u201cpilgrim-bottles\u201d of fine yellow paste\u2019 without publishing them, suggested also that they were produced at Naukratis, like the scarabs and scaraboids manufactured in a similar material (Petrie 1886, 37). New Year\u2019s flasks are very common during the 26th dynasty. When cartouches are incised on the body of the flasks, they always refer to pharaohs of the 26th dynasty, especially Apries and Amasis, or to the Divine Votaress Ankhnesneferibre (God\u2019s wife of Amun from around 586 to 525 BC) (Caubet and Pierrat-Bonnefois 2005, 148-151, no. 398). Specimens discovered outside Egypt seem to originate from 7th-6th century contexts (Caubet and Pierrat-Bonnefois 2005, 151). However, recent excavations provided a few examples from later contexts. They are attested in late 26th-early 27th dynasty contexts (Masson 2007, 614, pl. XXVII) and in Persian contexts at \u2018Ayn Manawir in the Oasis of Dakhla (Wuttmann et al. 1996, 429- 430). These flasks, offered as a gift for the New Year, were possibly meant to contain the water of the Nile as it rose at the beginning of the flood season. They often bear an inscription, here arranged in a vertical band in the centre of the body, wishing an excellent year to the owner of the flask. The inscription usually refers to the local gods, though not always (see, for example, specimens from Sais and San el-Hagar: von Bissing 1902, nos 3741-3743). Amun-Ra, who is mentioned on this specimen, was the main god revered at Naukratis (Guermeur 2005, 126-138). von Bissing, F.
