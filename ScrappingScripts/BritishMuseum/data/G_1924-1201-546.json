Although Lemos identifies the sherd as belonging to a chalice, the shape of the rim is unusual in Chian wares, thus suggesting that the sherd does not come from a chalice but rather a wide open vessel. Although bowls are not typical of the Simple Animal Style, the rim pattern is consistent with the Sphinx and Lion and Simple Animal Style. However, the lack of decoration on the exterior surface of the sherd is consistent only with the Simple Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
