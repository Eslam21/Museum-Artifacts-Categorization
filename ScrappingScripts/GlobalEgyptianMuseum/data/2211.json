{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1904:530", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "CARVED; GLAZED", "Height": "0.9 cm", "Width": "0.6 cm", "Name": "Amulet of a cat", "Description": "Rare 18th Dynasty amulet in the form of a crouching cat, carved from steatite and glazed in green-blue, with the name of the god Amun-Re incised crudely in hieroglyphs on the underside. The piece was found among the votive offerings to the goddess Hathor at Deir el-Bahari, her principal sanctuary in Thebes. Although the cat first becomes a common motif of Egyptian art only centuries later (after about 900 BC), it already figures in New Kingdom depictions of the sun-god Re and in association with Hathor, goddess of beauty, on cosmetic objects."}
