{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA55193"], "Description": [" Polychrome glass vessel in the form of a 'bulti'-fish: this is the most spectacular of a small group of fish-form vessels, all representing the 'bulti'-fish common in the Nile and a standard feature of Egyptian decorative art. The body is core-built in blue glass with a matt finish, and is decorated with simple festoons in groups of three or four white lines followed by a yellow line. The tail decorations are in the same colours. The dorsal fin is composed of a series of heavy threads in the body (blue, white, yellow, and turquoise-blue). The front fins are each composed of one light and one darker blue thread. The front ventral fins are made from one white and one yellow thread each while the rear ventral fin is of turquoise-blue glass. A yellow thread outlines the mouth. The eyes are white opaque circles with the pupils represented by black thread loops. The fish is assembled from several fragments.

Fish-form vessels were common in many media at this time - the glass examples are but versions of others - but how they were used is not evident. They seem to have been ointment vessels and must have been furnished with stands as they are incapable of standing by themselves. Bibliography: J. D.
