{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7359", "Dating": "RAMESSES III/USERMAATRE-MERIAMUN (not before); NEW KINGDOM; NEW KINGDOM (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURED OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN; DRAWING", "Height": "17.5 cm", "Name": "King Ramesses III smiting his enemies", "Description": "The Egyptians drew on ostraka for a variety of reasons; for example, while planning work on tombs or as exercises. Some creations were simply the result of the craftsman's imagination. This ostrakon shows king Ramesses III wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt smiting with his weapon foreign enemies whom he holds by the hair. This drawing is probably a copy of a wall scene on one of the pylons of a ramesside temple. The scene is accompanied by two royal cartouches and a simple caption in hieroglyphs."}
