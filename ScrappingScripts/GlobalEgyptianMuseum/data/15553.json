{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 32974", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "RECEPTACLE/VESSEL", "Material": "GLASS", "Technique": "BLOWN", "Name": "Glass Vessel in the Shape of a Fish", "Description": "This multicolored glass vessel in the shape of a fish might have been a cosmetics container. It is decorated with yellow and white inverted V-shaped designs. Glass with such decorative patterns was not blown but was molded around a clay core, which was then removed when the glass had cooled. To create the designs, the artisan applied little yellow and white glass rods to the smooth, reheated surface of the vessel. The colors fused together as they melted. It is possible that the craft of glassmaking was first introduced into Egypt after the campaigns of Tuthmosis the Third of the Eighteenth Dynasty."}
