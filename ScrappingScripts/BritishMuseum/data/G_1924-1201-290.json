Lemos describes the sherd as belonging to the Group of Light-Walled Naukratis Animal Chalices. All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 93). Vessels in the Mature Animal Style and Type A kantharoi are contemporary."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
