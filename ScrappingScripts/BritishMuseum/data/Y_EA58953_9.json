{"artifact_name": "tile", "Object Type": ["tile"], "Museum number": ["EA58953"], "Description": [" Six fragments of bright-blue glazed composition tiles, four large and two small, the large fragments are broadly rectangular in form, with a vertical register of gilded hieroglyphs, including the names and titles of Amenhotep III. The hieroglyphs are modelled in delicate raised gesso relief (linen inclusions can be detected in the gesso). The hieroglyphs are decorated with fine incised detail, somewhat obscured by the cracks in the gilding; in places the gesso has flaked off, leaving only a faint outline, or a damaged area, on the glazed surface.

Tile inlays often featured on the doorframes, columns, cavetto cornices, and throne pedestals of New Kingdom palaces and temples, such as at Tell el-Yahudiya and Qantir. These brightly decorated tiles were part of the iconographic programme, and most probably come from door-ways, and the throne dais. They allow a sense of the vivid colours that decorated sculpture, architectural surfaces, and most inscriptions. These tiles are particularly fine examples featuring rich materials: gold (apparently applied on a linen backing) and thin, translucent faience (glazed composition). The tiles are related to Amenhotep III but the exact provenance of these examples is unknown. Somewhat similar tiles have also been found at the palace city of Amenhotep III at Malqata. Published: R.
