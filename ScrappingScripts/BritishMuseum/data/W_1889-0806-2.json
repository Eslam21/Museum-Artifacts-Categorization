", " It is most unusual for the name of a commodity to follow, rather than precede, the word 'w\u0101f' in the legends of vessel stamps. For this reason, and because on most specimens the word is only partly visible, 'wasma' has not been recognized on this type before. However it is sufficiently clear on the specimen in the Fouquet Collection. Woad is one of the more common commodities on vessel stamps, which makes it unlikely that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 did not issue stamps for it; no others have been described. Miles 1958, 84, which is not illustrated but has the same legend without the last line, may well be a product of the same die (Cf. also Miles 1964, 24).
