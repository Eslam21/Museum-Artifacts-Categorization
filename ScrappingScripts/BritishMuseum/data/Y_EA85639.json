{"artifact_name": "stopper", "Object Type": ["stopper"], "Museum number": ["EA85639"], "Description": [" Big fragment of a clay sealing with a convex outer surface, probably following a larger vessel or similar object, used as jar stopper, with an approximate diameter of 30 to 35 cm. The object has two rear sides so that it has a triangular section. One rear shows two parallel lines slightly raised above the surface that might be impressions caused by the ribbing of a vessel. Also a larger inclusion of a white lime fragment is visible on this side. The second underside shows a slightly uneven surface and an area of rectangular voids that might originate from organic material as larger charcoal particles are still visible in the clay here. The outer surface shows seven impressions of a small circular seal with a motif that was cut only very shallow and is therefore not visible anymore.
