", " Lemos places this sherd in Group A of the Sphinx and Lion Style. The decoration on the vases from this group is the most elaborate. The rosette has a standard cogwheel shape and the figures are carefully drawn and details are expertly incised. Boardman discusses analysis carried out on 'AN1925.608c, a black-figure Chian sherd'. The sherd associated with this registration number is a North Ionian reserved plate rim, while the only Chian black-figured sherd from this registration number series is AN1925.608e(4). If this is the sherd to which Boardman refers (the fabric was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA)), it was found that the fabric originated in the southwestern or western region of the island, in the same area as pottery found at Emporio (Jones with J. Boardman in Jones 1986, p.287). "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
