This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This small scarab belongs to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). It belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites, and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A1-18, see especially A18 for this specimen). The hieroglyphs in the \"half cartouche\", as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93), and, in that case, Gorton suggested the inscription could stand more precisely for Wa-ib-re, the Horus name of Pammetichus I or the name of Apries (Gorton 1996, 110). For a similar motif but on a glazed composition scarab, see BM 1886,0401.1650. For another close parallel from Naukratis, where the griffin is replaced by a falcon holding flail, see BM 1886,0401.1647. See also Petrie 1917, pl. LIV, no. 25 G.2.
