This fits with an example from Tamassos dated to the Cypro-Archaic period (Karageorghis 1996, Fitzwilliam GR.230-1892. Stag pl.23.5 M3), probably Cypro-Archaic II period. A stag figure is also known from temple of Apollo at Kourion (Karageorghis 1996, 39). A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Karageorghis, V. 1996.
