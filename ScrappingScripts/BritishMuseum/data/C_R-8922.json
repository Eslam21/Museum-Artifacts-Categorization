They claimed descent from the goddess Venus and her son, the Trojan hero Aeneas, who saved his father from the fall of Troy and, according to legend, fled to Italy. The Romans traced their history back to him. These claims were duly illustrated on the coins made in Caesar's name. In his lifetime Caesar was also clearly addressed and worshipped as a god in his own right, at least by some. For Greeks and Romans the boundary between humanity and divinity was often quite porous - both Antony and Octavian would follow Caesar in crossing it."], "Bibliographic references": [" RRC / Roman Republican Coinage (458/1) ", " RR2 / Coins of the Roman Republic in the British Museum, vol. 2.
