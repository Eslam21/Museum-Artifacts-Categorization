Very few Type 11 cups were found at Naukratis and Schlotzhauer suggests that these may have been made in specific workshops that rarely exported vases to Naukratis. The greyness of the fabric, which is not typical of Ionian cup, led Oren in 'Migdol: A New Fortress on the Edge of the Eastern Nile Delta', BASOR, 1984, 27 note 19' to suggest that the cup was produced at Naukratis and using local clay. Schlotzhauer dismisses this suggestion by pointing out that the cup was burnt. The place of production of Type 11 South Ionian cups is determined as Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.570) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric. Schlotzhauer writes that the sherd joins British Museum 1924,1201.74 but this is incorrect. 1886,0401.1034 was re-registered in error as 1924,1201.74."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer & Villing 2006 / East Greek Pottery from Naukratis: The Current State of Research (P. 68 note 108) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 53, no. 375, p. 102-3, NAU 54, pl. 12 c) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.251) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.1034"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 1924,1201.74 (Re-registered in error.)
