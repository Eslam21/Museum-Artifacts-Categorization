This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The cult of Mahes as the son of Bastet was the most dynamic in Leontopolis and Bubastis. Naukratis bestowed very few figures of this warrior god, in glazed composition and bronze (Masson forthcoming). See notably Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.683, BM 1885,1101.84 and maybe Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H1051.2. On Mahes amulets see: Andrews 1994, 25, fig. 23b; Herrmann et al. 2010, 44 (type 13). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
