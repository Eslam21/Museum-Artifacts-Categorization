This intaglio gem set into a gold ring shows a man wearing a skullcap surmounted by a disc. He also wears a short, false beard. The man has a sturdy, thick neck supporting a strong, heavily built face. The large eye is quite low down the line of the nose beneath a heavy brow, and the lips are full. The physiognomy is distinctly un-Greek in appearance.
