Ab\u012b Yaz\u012bd begins the long series of counterstamps with the names of executives and legends most commonly beginning '\u02bfal\u0101 yaday' ('at the hands of). Four dies for counterstamps of Yaz\u012bd have been described. Two are very similar to the present type. One, lacking the star beneath the legend, is described below. Another, with a slightly different arrangement (/Ab\u012b for A/b\u012b) is known from one specimen (Miles 1948, 47). On the fourth, also represented by a single specimen, the legend begins 'amara', so it probably belongs to Yaz\u012bd's own Finance Directorship. (Balog 1976, 221, where the reference to Miles 1971, 18-19 is mistaken.) Like the earlier anonymous ones, the counterstamps with executives' names were used on heavy weights as well as vessel stamps and are therefore found linked with the stamps of Finance Directors, which usually include the denomination. The present stamp was used on heavy weights of both \u1e24af\u1e63 b. al-Wal\u012bd and \u02bf\u012as\u0101 b. Ab\u012b \u02bfAt\u0101. It came into use when \u1e24af\u1e63 became Finance Director, for it is found on half and quarter-ra\u1e6dls of the series dated 124/741-2 (OA+ 4415. With stamps of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 it is known from half-ra\u1e6dls and from two different half-ra\u1e6dl meat weights . It also occurs on a meat weight of uncertain denomination and probably on another damaged ring weight . Curiously, none of Yaz\u012bd's other counterstamps has yet been recorded on a weight.
