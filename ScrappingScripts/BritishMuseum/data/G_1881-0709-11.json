{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1881,0709.11"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of elderly woman. An old woman walking forwards, her head hunched. She wears a long chiton with sleeves, and has a large himation, falling, both back and front, from her left shoulder, to wrap round the middle of her body and upper legs; the shawl envelopes her lowered left arm except for her hand, below which a corner hangs in a small gather. Her right arm is bent, but the raised lower arm is broken away. Her hair is parted in the centre and is drawn into clusters of curls hiding her ears. She wears a sakkos, secured with a binding just behind its front folds. The back of the figure has less modelling than the front; there is no vent. Hollow; two-piece mould, including the head, with much hand-working; the right arm was separately made and added. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a darker surface; traces of an overall white dressing; red-brown paint on hair; very small areas of blue paint on chiton, yellow on himation.
