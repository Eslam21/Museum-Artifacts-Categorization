{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:111", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "13 cm", "Width": "2.2 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Wooden statue of Maat", "Description": "Rough hewn wooden figure of the goddess Maat, personification of 'what is Right', depicted as a woman with her emblem, the ostrich plume, in her hair, squatting on a block. There are red pigment smears over the surface, and the figure may have been deposited in a tomb before it was finished. The cuboid block beneath the goddess may have served to lock the figure into a larger whole, either a flat pedestal, or, perhaps an openwork panel for a cult shrine or item of burial equipment. Figures of the goddess become common in the Late Period, when one of the most common temple relief scenes shows the king offering just such a figure to the gods."}
