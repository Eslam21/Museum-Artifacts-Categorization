{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63796", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "14.5 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of Monkeys Gathering Dum", "Description": "This drawing depicts two monkeys wearing girdles tied around their waists and climbing up the trunk of a large palm tree to reach the Dum or Hyphaene Thebaica. The monkeys were most likely trained to climb trees and gather Dum. These large Dum were gathered and pressed for their oil, which was used in cooking. The monkey on the left is looking backward, as if it had been distracted while climbing the palm tree. Cross-hatching was used here to convey the fur of the monkeys and the surface of the tree. On the other side of this ostracon is a sketch of a nude young male who seems to be driving a monkey. He holds a short crook in his right hand."}
