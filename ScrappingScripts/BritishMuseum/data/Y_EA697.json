{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA697"], "Description": [" Fragmentary sandstone standing statue of Ramses II, only the lower legs, base and part of the arm and standard now remaining. The king is depicted in a striding position with the left leg advancing ahead of the right, and he wears a long kilt with a pleated front panel. A row of uraeus cobras and a column of incised text are carved across his clothing, with deliberate damage to the upper portion of the text. An underlayer of thin material is visible across his feet, and he wears carefully carved sandals. At his feet are four short columns of text consisting of royal names and titles. At his left side he holds a standard, the lower portion intact and also inscribed with a column text. Behind the standard a small female figure of Queen Bintanat is depicted in sunken relief. She wears a crown, long wig, a tight-fitting dress, and holds a lotus flower by her side. Her right hand is extended towards the image of the king. In front of her is another column of incised text, with her name incorrectly written inside the cartouche. On the reverse is a broad back-pillar with two columns of text, the upper portion now missing. Two further lines of inscription are carved around the statue base, both beginning at the front of the base and concluding on the reverse. A smaller plinth is found underneath this statue base. Separate surviving pieces of the same statue include a part of the back-pillar with the relief image of the queen's head on the proper left side, a fragmentary right hand broken at the wrist and with a clenched fist, and an upper portion of the standard and left arm. There is damage to the king's left foot, and several chips to the edges of the statue base. There are also visible cracks to the left side of the standard and base.

Other monuments of the king wearing a pleated kilt, now broken, were also found within this temple showing him with the goddess Hathor (e.g. E.5012, Cairo Egyptian Museum). The various evocations of Hathor and turquoise within the surviving inscriptions further connects the monument to the wider Serabit el-Khadim area, which was an important site for mining this precious material. Ramses' daughter Bintanat, depicted on the left side of the statue, was his eldest daughter by Queen Isitnofret. She is depicted on several other monuments with the king (Gauthier 1914). Like her half-sister Merytamun, Bintanat was raised to the rank of queen possibly after the death of her mother. Bintanat was buried in Tomb 71 in the Valley of the Queens (PM I:II, no. 71.)
