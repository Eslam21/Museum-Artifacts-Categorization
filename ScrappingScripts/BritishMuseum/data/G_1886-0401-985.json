Because of the missing flutings and the inscription, this fragment did probably not belong to a column but rather a round base of a votive. In Petrie Journal 1884-1885, p. 214, mention of this find: \u201cIn the surface rubbish of the Dioscuri temenos we found a chip of very hard limestone column (26 in[che]s diameter) inscribed in fine early style [Greek inscription MA] No city or god belonging to this place has been MA nor does it fall in any formula we have yet found here? Was it a column, dedicated by Amasis? There is a supposition.\u201d On Petrie sketch of the inscription the M is followed with what seems to be an A, and the traces remain. Yet prior to the M an epsilon seems assured, certainly not an A (Petrie journal, 1884-1885 (EES Archive XVII 47), p. 201) Naukratis, I, pp. 16, 62, pl. XVIIII, 12 and pl. XXXV, 688.
