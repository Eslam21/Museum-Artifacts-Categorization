", " Venit: 'Bowl fragments 83-85 [Alexandria 17256, 9327, 9310] are unusual because of the incised florals on their interiors, a technique rather associated with \"Vroulian\" (see below p.48). But the ornament on the exterior, unlike \"Vroulian\", is in reserve and the wild goats on no.85 connect these fragments with the Wild Goat style. For polychrome incised florals see JHS 44 (1924), p.201 fig.32 and Oxford G 119.42 (CVA Great Britain 9: pl.4 fig.29). In JHS 44 (1924), p.200 E.R. Price compared these florals with Vroulian, but in CVA Great Britain 9: p.79 she says, \"The use of black ground with incision and colour for some parts of the outside of the vase to contrast with the white slip on other parts is not uncommon in Camiran\".
