{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" White limestone head of a female figure. Only the head is preserved; very few areas of light wear. The face is oval in shape with pronounced cheekbones and protruding eyes. The left eyebrow continues far into the temple-area. The nose is small and short. The mouth is small with pronounced dimples. The headscarf covers the high calvarium and covers the ears entirely. The back is lightly rounded.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Likely from Petrie's excavations in the sanctuary of Aphrodite, or the area of the town adjacent to the sanctuaries of Apollo and Hera. No precise contextual information is recorded. The broad, fleshy face of this head is comparable to a head from Idalion, which R. Senff dates - in accordance with the dedication of the Dionyshermos in Paris - shortly after the middle of the sixth century BC. The headscarf of this one covers the ears entirely, as is shown on the heads from the sanctuary of Aphrodite in Idalion. (Comstock - Vermeule 1976. p.263, no.414; Nick 2006, 67, 122-123, no. 54, pl. 21). This would make this a late variant of a Cypriot figure plaque. Such plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600- 575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re- dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/ 550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
