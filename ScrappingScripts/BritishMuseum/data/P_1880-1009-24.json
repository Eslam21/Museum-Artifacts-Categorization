He is holding a lance, with an axe-head at the end. The right forearm has been re-drawn by the artist. This sheet is one of the earliest of Buch's few surviving works; his latest is the \u2018Landscape with a moated castle\u2019, a pen drawing, dated 1594, formerly in the collection of C.R. Rudolf, London (sale, Christie, 1975, 8 July, lot 90). There is another drawing from Buch's early period in Frankfurt \u2018Landscape with the Flight into Egypt\u2019, dated 1549 ((St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut; Schilling, Frankfurt, i, p. 73, no. 72, ii, repr.). The figure in the present drawing has been copied by another hand on a sheet of various studies which are all evidently copies, at Karlsruhe, formerly attributed to Tobias Stimmer (Th\u00f6ne, \u2018Stimmer\u2019, p. 101, no. 259). A further drawn copy, with the figure reversed, by Hans Friedrich Schorer (c. 1585-after 1646), signed and dated 1621, in which the figure represents Mars, was with C.G. Boerner, D\u00fcsseldorf, in 1977 (C.G.Boerner, \u2018Mit Kreide und Tusche: hundert Zeichnungen von 1560-1860\u2019, p. 6, no. 10, repr. on the back cover).' Additional information: A drawing of a very similar figure, standing in the same position as the landsknecht seen here with slight alterations to the armour and without the axe-head on top of the lance, was sold at Sotheby's in 2008 (9 July, lot 5). The small changes to the armour and the suggestion of a landscape with striated rays of sunlight behind the figure on the Sotheby's drawing, but not seen on the BM sheet, make it most likely that these two and the related drawings mentioned by Rowlands all refer to an original prototype, as yet unidentified. Szilvia Bodnar published information on 17 drawings by Buch, mostly landscapes in the style of Lautensack, and a Virgin and Child formerly in the Lubomirski collection (see Strauss, Complete Drawings of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, New York, 1974, vol. 3, no.1515/71 ). There are six landscape drawings by Buch in Budapest. The signature on this drawing is different to all the others, which are all signed on the verso, except one in Berlin, a copy after Hieronymous Cock (after Heemskerck) of St Jerome, which is signed on the recto as well. Many were formerly in the possession of Paulus Praun, the sixteenth-century Nuremberg collector. Lit from Rowlands 1993: E. Schilling, Kunstmuseets Arsskrift, xxxviii, 1951, pp.53f. Further lit: S.
