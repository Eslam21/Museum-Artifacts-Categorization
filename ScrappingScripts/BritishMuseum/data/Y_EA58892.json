This small sphinx is one of the rare sculptures associated with Amenemhet IV, the last male ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty. The lion body sits on a large block base in the usual recumbent pose; its lower side has a hard protruding edge, known from other Middle Kingdom sphinxes. The breast is decorated with a pattern which recalls the mane of the famous sphinxes from Tanis attributed to Amenemhat III (Cairo, CG 393, 394), with their distinctive ruffs and leonine ears; however, the head is human here and wears a cloth nemes headdress. Another glance at the proportions of the head and the style reveals that something is not right: the head is too small for the body, the nemes is rather rounded, and the style and shape of the face is not in accord with Middle Kingdom styles. Examination of the nemes headdress shows traces of the same pattern as noted on the breast. The object has clearly been recut; in all probability it was originally a smaller version of the Tanis sphinxes, with the mane arranged into a tapering shape behind the head, not unlike the rough form of the nemes and thus making it relatively easy to convert. Most of the recutting would have taken place at the left and right sides of the face, where the ruff and mane had to be removed to allow for the creation of the ears. The recutting was doubtless carried out much later; the style of the face suggests this happened in the Late or, more probably, the Ptolemaic Period (664-30 BC). The brief inscription on the breast between the forepaws reads 'Maatkherure, may he live forever, beloved of Atum, lord of Heliopolis'. A temple in Heliopolis thus seems a reasonable original location for this statue. Perhaps it was moved from there to some other site in the Delta, conceivably Alexandria if the recutting dates from the Ptolemaic or Roman Period; this hypothesis is supported by the fact that many other objects of Heliopolitan origin, including obelisks, have been found in Alexandria. From there it eventually found its way to the Lebanon. The head of a quartzite sphinx of Amenemhat IV has been found at Heliopolis; another comes from Thebes, while three larger sphinxes of his have been found at Abukir, near Alexandria, no doubt again as a result of their reuse.
