", " According to Hogarth's journal (1903), this piece was discovered among other ex-votos to the north side of the enclosure wall, outside of the Great temenos (Masson forthcoming). The finished (or better finished?) product should have looked like a hand holding a mussel-shaped scoop, a very popular type of offering spoons. Its unfinished state points towards a local production. Naukratis provided a few hand-shell offering spoons maybe locally made, manufactured in bone such as this specimen (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.1047; Cairo, Egyptian Museum JE33549; BM 1888,0601.75). Already common in the New Kingdom, the hand-shell type persisted in the Third Intermediate Period with some differences in the material and innovations in the overall shape (Bult\u00e9 2008). During the Late Period very close archaizing copies of the New Kingdom are again produced. For example, two hand-shell spoons in bone were discovered in the Priests\u2019 Quarter in Karnak in a sealed context dated to the late 26th-early 27th dynasty (Masson 2007, Pl. XXIX, 1-2). If the identification is correct, this piece could probably be dated to the Saite or early Persian Period at the latest. Offering spoons are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. I.
