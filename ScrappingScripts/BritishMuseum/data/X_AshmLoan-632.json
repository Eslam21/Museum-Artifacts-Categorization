", " Lemos places this sherd in Group A of the Sphinx and Lion Style. The decoration on the vases from this group is the most elaborate. The rosette has a standard cogwheel shape and the figures are carefully drawn and details are expertly incised. Beazley suggests that the sherd may come from an aryballos but the shape is not known in Chian pottery. Lemos suggests that it might come from an oinochoe. Oinochoai are not common Chian shapes. If the sherd does come from an oinochoe, it would come from the shoulder area. If the sherd comes from a lid, then it likely formed part of the upper region of the lid near the handle.
