{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA65664"], "Description": [" Bronze axe-head: with pronounced cusps at the ends of the cutting edge. The butt of the axe, including the lugs, is missing. Most of the axe has been cleaned of corrosion product. There are a number of light scratches and tool marks on one face. The cutting edge is thin and quite sharp. One of the cusps has been turned by a blow but otherwise there are no obvious signs of wear. When acquired, the blade was attached to a cylindrical acacia wood haft by means of a modern string binding. The haft is split vertically at the top to form a crude socket, which was too large to accommodate the rear of the blade securely. To overcome this difficulty two small pieces of wood had been inserted into the lower half of the socket, the top piece forming an even platform on which the blade rested. A black adhesive seems then to have been applied and the whole bound tightly with string. At the bottom end, the haft has an expanding grip, which contains a hole, probably for a leather or string loop. It is cracked and abraded at several places along its length, and is flattened at the top.
