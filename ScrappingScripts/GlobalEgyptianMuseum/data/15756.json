We have masks in plaster from the end of the Old Kingdom. Beginning with the First Intermediate Period, the cartonnage cloth and plaster mask was modeled in the image of the deceased's head. It was usually painted, gilded, or decorated with semiprecious stones and colored glass. Royal masks were generally made of beaten gold adorned with inlays of colored stones or glass. On the mask of Yuya, the eyes are inlaid as on the coffin lid. The necklace is depicted in relief on the plaster. However, the chin is missing."}
