", " According to the registers, this was found under wall of second temple of the Hellenion, supposedly a 5th century Bc context. A East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of later Classical Greek style (broadly 450BC -330BC). Late Classical period parallels from Late 5th century BC Rhodes (Higgins 1970, no. 295) and early-mid 4th century Cyrenaica (ibid. nos 1534, 1539). Numerous parallels from the Hellenion at Naukratis, some fragments possibly from the same protome (Ashmolean AN1896-1908-G.110.a-c; AN1896-1908-E.4667; AN1896-1908-E.4786). The fabric of this and the parallels from Naukratis are consistent an East Greek origin, particularly Rhodes. Protome busts were produced in East Greece, Greece and Southern Italy. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019, though numerous production places likely existed across East Greece. Protomes (also called busts, shoulder-busts, protome-busts and erroneously \u2018masks\u2019) were first made in East Greece around 550BC (Croissant 1983) then Greece (Robinson 1931; 1933; 1952; Szab\u00f3 1994) and Magna Graeca (Kilmer 1977, 65-7) in the late Archaic period. The earliest forms simply show the head with a framing veil, though increased complexity and details resulted in half of the figure being represented by the 5th century BC (Mandel & Gossel-Raeck 2004). By the mid-5th century they become less common, though rare finds have been found, in Hellenistic contexts (Kilmer 1977, 66; Smith 1949, 355; Stampolid\u0113s et al. 2011, 383, no. 72). Protomes are primarily found in sanctuaries, graves (possibly reused Kilmer 1977, 68; not used as funeral masks, Smith 1949, 355) and occasionally in domestic contexts (Higgins 1954; Kilmer 1977, 68). Protomes have been interpreted as representations of Hera, Athena, Aphrodite (Aphrodite in Naukratis, Smith 1949, 355, fn. 3, figs. 6 & 7), Demeter or Kore as a chthonic goddess (contra Blinkenberg 1931, 588-9), but are more commonly thought to represent the devotee (ibid; Croissant 1983). Many fragmentary parallels of protomes and protome-busts from Naukratis in Archaic and Classical Greek style in East Greek and local Egyptian fabrics.
