{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1904,1113.3"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure holding pine-cone. The middle part of a large figure of a male celebrant in a striding pose, modelled in the round, the head missing and much of the legs lost. He wears a short tunic with sleeves, tied at the waist, and holds a pine cone against his body with his left hand. His lowered right hand holds an uncertain object, perhaps a folded wreath or cloth. The front of the figure appears to be intact, but there has been much modern patching with plaster at the back and possible overpainting. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a greybrown core. The figure seems to have been almost entirely painted black, over which was applied an off-white colour to show the tunic, leaving the arms and legs black. The legs and arms were then touched up in black paint, and a vertical stripe down the right side of the tunic was added, together with details of the V of the garment; the wreath or cloth is painted red, and there appears to be brown and grey paint on the pine cone.
