See Laffineur 1986, 91 for a discussion illustrated with numerous examples of the plainer forms from Amathus. An example was found at Kourion Ayios Ermoyenis in 1883-4 during excavations sponsored by Col. Falkland Warren on behalf of Lady Annie Brassey (illustrated in Taylor 2001, 224, fig. 22.4). Another direct parallel is GR 1881,8-24.10 from a tomb in Salamis. Bibliography: Laffineur R. 1986, 'L'orf\u00e8vrerie', in R. Laffineur et al., Amathonte III.
