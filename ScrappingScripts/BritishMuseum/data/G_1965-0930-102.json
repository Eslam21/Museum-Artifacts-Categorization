The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic elements and the absence of decoration on the interior and exterior surfaces make it difficult to ascertain to what group this sherd belongs. The brown bands on the lower body are consistent with most Chian styles. The thinness of the sherd however, suggests that it comes from a later example in the series, perhaps a Chalice Style or Black Figure Komast or Animal chalice."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1231) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.102"]}
