It inspires both fear and admiration. The royal cobra, in particular, protects the wearer against enemies. In the Books of the Underworld, uraei serve as the guardians of doors and gates. This amulet was found on the forehead of the mummy and this favours an interpretation as a protective uraeus snake."}
