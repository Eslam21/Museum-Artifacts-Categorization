It could be understood as a motto, a prophylactic inscription or it could be a way to write the name of Amun-Ra, with the sign j replaced by a Maat feather (Hall 1913, 206, no. 2051; see also on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). Similar cone seals were discovered on Punic sites such as Carthage (Gorton 1996, 48, fig. 8, no. 23-24, type XVB). According to Gorton, such scaraboids belongs to a Phoenician type of the 7th-6th centuries (Gorton 1996, 43, 48, type XVB).
