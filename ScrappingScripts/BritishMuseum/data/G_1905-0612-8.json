{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1905,0612.8"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of prowling female (?) cat with her right foreleg advanced. Carved from soft Egyptian limestone. The eyeballs are almost spherical, with sharply defined lids. Her head is small in comparison to her body. The cat is carved in a prowling posture, her head is poised on a long neck with shoulders hunched up. She is a sleek cat, with her rear legs both extended as if poised, ready to pounce. Missing: the front legs, the rear right leg, the left rear leg from the joint, the tail, the right ear and part of the left ear. The surface is in poor condition with much of the original surface having flaked away, now consolidated. The face is severely damaged, but the features are discernible, especially the eyes. A groove has been cut out of the right side of the body perhaps deliberate or damage. The head has been re-affixed.

These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria. In terms of material, style and technique, GR 1905.6-12.8 and GR1905.6-12.11, although different sizes, are similar. The postures of the two cats are alike, both carved as if prowling, with their heads poised on long necks and shoulders hunched up. Edgar, C. C. 1903. Greek sculpture.
