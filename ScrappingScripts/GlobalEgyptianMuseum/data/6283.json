The head is represented schematically, the elytra are well indicated and the incisions delineating the legs significant. A royal titulary is clearly carved on the flat surface: it mentions King Thutmosis III - Menkheperre in a cartouche topped with Nsw-bity (''the king of Upper and Lower Egypt''). A suspension hole pierces the object longitudinally. The date of the tomb is based on its proximity to the Hathor sanctuary to the south and the ''temple'' to the east-south-east."}
