The text is written in hieratic, a handwritten adaptation of hieroglyphs for the medium of ink and brush on papyrus. The papyrus is divided into five sections. The first three sections describe the donations made by King Ramesses III (1184-1153 BC) to the gods and temples of Thebes, Memphis, and Heliopolis. The amounts were colossal: the list relating to Thebes alone includes 309,950 sacks of grain and large quantities of metals and semi-precious stones. Each of the three sections alternate with an illustration showing the king making offerings to the sacred families of Amun(-Ra), Ptah, and Ra(-Horakhty), the chief deities of these cult centres. This full colour vignette shows Ramesses III before a group of Heliopolitan gods: Ra-Horakhty, Atum, Iusaas(-Henut-Iunu), and Hathor(-Nebethetepet). The images are accompanied by hieroglyphic labels. The next section of the papyrus deals with a number of minor temples. The final section recounts the historical events of the reign and lists the possessions of all the great temples at the time of the king\u2019s death. The text presents the chaos at the beginning of the Twentieth Dynasty (about 1186-1069 BC) including military battles with the Sea Peoples, Libyans, and Meshwesh, and other foreign expeditions. This section is clearly idealised, glorifying the king rather than presenting a trustworthy historical narrative. Nonetheless, it does contain many important pointers to the history of the reign. The account ends with the death of Ramesses III and the accession of his son Ramesses IV (1153-1147 BC)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Grandet 1994 / Le Papyrus Harris I: BM 9999 ", " Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (381231) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/381231) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2011 Jul\u2013Sept, Newcastle, Great North Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Oct\u2013Jan, Dorchester, Dorset County Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Feb\u2013June, Leeds City Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Jul-Oct, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Nov\u2013 Feb 2013, Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2013 Mar\u2013Aug, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018-2019 16 Oct\u201320 Jan, Madrid, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019 19 Feb\u201325 Aug, Girona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019-2020 24 Sept\u201312 Jan, Seville, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2020\u20132021 11 Feb\u201321 Feb, Tarragona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2021 25 Mar\u201315 Aug, Santiago de Compostela, Museo Centro de Gaias, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2021-2022 15 Sep\u20139 Jan, Zaragoza, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2022 10 Feb\u201315 May, Palma, La Caixa, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2022-2023 21 Jun\u201326 Feb, Valencia, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt "], "Condition": ["Papyrus Survey: Condition Details: Papyrus: loss, delaminating, fractured, bleached Black ink Pigment (cracked, loss) Backed: white paper checked for loan USA 1997 Mount Details: Sandwich: glass Sandwich: board Binding: leather Object Priority: B Mount Priority: A Overall Condition: C Curatorial condition comment: fair"], "Subjects": ["ancient egyptian deity"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription & portrayed: Ramses III ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Ra-Horakhty ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Atum ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Iusaas-Nebethetepet ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Hathor-Nebethetepet "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Miss Selima Harris"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Anthony Charles Harris"], "Acquisition date": ["1872"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA9999,24"], "Registration number": ["1872,1101.1.24"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: Frame.24 "]}
