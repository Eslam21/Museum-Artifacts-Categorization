{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA124"], "Description": [" Upper body of a limestone seated male figure. He wears a smooth shoulder-length wig that is tucked behind his small ears. His eyebrows are modelled in raised relief, and slightly arched. His eyes are almond shaped with a thin incised line at the crease of his upper eyelid. The skin underneath his eyes is slightly sunken. His nose is damaged but the surviving outline suggests it was broad in size. His mouth is small and his lips are pursed together. The lower lip is sharply incised, and the outer corners of his mouth are slightly upturned, creating a small smile. His face is extremely rounded at the jawline, and he wears a short formal beard. His neck is broad and fleshy. His upper body is bare, with subtle modeling of the chest and a narrowed waist. Both arms are placed on the lap, the right forearm and left hand now lost. There is an outline of a knotted loop of material at the left side of his torso. The upper portion of his kilt is still intact, with a partial column of incised text beginning at the waistline. In addition to the loss of the lower body, the nose and right forearm have been broken, with visible chisel marks at the nose. There are also notable chips at the wig, and a portion of the chest on the right side is also damaged and discoloured.
