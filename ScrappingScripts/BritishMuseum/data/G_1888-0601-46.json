Missing seat which was a block? sub-oval break underneath. Glaze now cream colour, but tinge of blue still survives on front. Secondary colour on hair black brown, chestnut colour, but now largely missing. Core - white, very fine texture, medium hard.

", " An unusually fine figurine from the same group as flute players and walking male and female figures. But this one is outstanding for the quality of the glaze and core, and the fineness of the modelling. Parallels for the fabric come from Samos, in particular a kneeling flute player, (Webb forthcoming Catalogue of Faience from the Samos Heraion, no. 295) Unusual also is the pose, and the specific type of amphora, Cypro-Phoenician in type.Whether the figure is actually intended to represent a drunken man clutching his favourite tipple seems unlikely. Such portraits are of Hellenistic date. This must rather be an offerer with his gift for the deity.
