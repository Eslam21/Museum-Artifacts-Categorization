{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7702", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ELKAB/NEKHEB", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; SCULPTURED", "Height": "59 cm", "Width": "29 cm", "Name": "Sphinx", "Description": "This sphinx of sandstone comes from the belgian excavations of Elkab. It is characterised by a human head, more specifically, a royal head wearing the \"nemes\" head-dress and a false beard. The sphinx, which was originally a solar symbol, protector of the horizon, became from the New Kingdom onwards a protector of temples. Thus they are to be seen in rows guarding sanctuary entrances. This example of Brussels probably dates from the Late Period.  "}
