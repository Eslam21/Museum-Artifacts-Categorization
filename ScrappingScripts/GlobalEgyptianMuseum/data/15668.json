{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 70114", "Dating": "DJER", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "JAR LABEL", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "INCISED", "Height": "8.5 cm", "Width": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Label of King Djer", "Description": "Wooden labels were attached to jars and leather bags to describe their contents. This label dates to the reign of King Djer of the First Dynasty. Because Egyptian writing at that time was still in development, it is difficult to decipher all the hieroglyphs engraved on it. The text and numbers on the lower registers, or sections, of the label probably refer to some common oil, wine, grain, or dried fruits. The upper part is decorated with a scene commemorating some event in the reign of Djer. The label has a hole in its top right corner where a fragment of cord remains."}
