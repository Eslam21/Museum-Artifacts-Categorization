Numerous amulets of falcons, made out of bronze, glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis. This rather large amuletic figure belongs to a common type at Naukratis, probably produced locally (Masson forthcoming; on this specific type of falcon figure, also found and produced in Kamiros: Webb 1978, 95, no. 685), maybe at the Scarab Factory itself (Webb forthcoming). Part of this production was intended for the Greek market. Some were discovered in the Greek temples of Apollo and Aphrodite in Naukratis. Andrews, C.A.R. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.

", " This falcon figurine is apparently similar to a large class of figurines in the form of the Horus falcon, which are found on East Greek sites, and which display a very good Egyptian style. See especially the very large number from Samos Heraion. (Webb forthcoming 2014, nos. 339-609). And additional number from the most recent excavations to east of the Rhoikos Altar. (Niemeier and Henke) They are also found in Rhodes -Lindos, Camirus and Ialysus, Ephesus, Miletus and other east Greek sites. However, this piece is closer in style to Cypriot limestone falcons, and does not give us leave to associate the East Greek finds with Naukratis. They are in any case probably earlier than the Naukratis faience material, being dated between 630-590/80 and their closest parallels are with fine bronze falcons like those found not only with other Egyptian bronzes at the Heraion on Samos, but also in Egypt itself, for example at the Serapeion at Saqqara.
