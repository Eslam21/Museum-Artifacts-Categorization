The piece shows a cartouche with the name of Ramesses II resting on a basket (the \"neb\" hieroglyph, signifying power) and ornamented, at the top, with two ostrich feathers and a solar disk. The group is flanked by two palms (signifying \"years\") found on a frog (signifying the number 100.000) accompanied by the shen-ring (signifying \"that which the sun encircles in its journey\"). The combination of all these hieroglyphic signs and symbols expresses a wish of infinite duration for the reign of the most famous king of the 19th Dynasty."}
