Her feminine features are obvious in her big eyes, plump cheeks, and small mouth. She wears the Nemes headdress with a uraeus, or royal cobra, and the Shendyt kilt so that she would be accepted by the Egyptians, whose traditions demanded a male ruler. The queen stands on the nine bows, thus, portraying her control over foreign countries. Her name and titles are inscribed on the base as \"The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maat-ka-Re, may she live forever.\" Queen Hatshepsut ruled Egypt for about 20 prosperous and peaceful years. The statue was destroyed into many parts in the time of her successor, King Tuthmosis the Third. It was restored in modern times."}
