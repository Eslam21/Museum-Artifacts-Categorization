{"artifact_name": "model", "Object Type": ["model"], "Museum number": ["EA36849"], "Description": [" Limestone bust of a king, a trial piece or sculptor\u2019s model. The king wears a nemes headdress, with smooth lappets that extend down onto his shoulders. The body of the uraeus cobra that once adorned his forehead has been carefully removed. His ears are large and crudely modelled, and his face is long and rounded at the jawline. His eyes are narrow with thin and flat eyebrows, and his nose is slim. His thin lips are pursed together, and his face is fleshy. His chest area is smoothed into a flat plane, and his arms have not been modelled. On the sides of the bust and on the reverse are traces of a proportional grid. There are small chips to the sides of the bust and along the nemes headdress, with larger gouges and scratches visible across the reverse. The object is now supported by a slim modern base.

Such models were used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure the production of an even three-dimensional sculpture; on the reverse of typical surviving trial-pieces, this area usually included an incised proportional grid.
