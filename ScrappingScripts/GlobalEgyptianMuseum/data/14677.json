She also wears the himation, a rectangular cloth draped over the left shoulder and about the body. It reveals one of her breasts under her raised right arm. She stretches her right leg forward in a dancing movement. She wears a crown made of plants. Her hair flows from beneath the crown on both sides of the head. Her expression indicates her emotions in dancing and playing music, as shown from the uplifted eyes and arch-shaped eyebrows. It is likely that the mouth, currently broken, was open."}
