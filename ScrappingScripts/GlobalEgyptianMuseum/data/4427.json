Meretseger is depicted with the body of a woman and a snake's head, she is seated on a throne facing right before a table of offerings. In her right hand she holds the ankh-sign and in her left is the was-sceptre. She wears a tall, double-plumed crown. Around the scene are five columns of vertical inscription, giving Meretseger's epithets. The technique was described as good, the lines were clearly carved and the scene was well proportioned."}
