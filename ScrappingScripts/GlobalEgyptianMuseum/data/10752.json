It is a cast of an original made of metal. The surface is framed by a row of drops in relief. The bust of the ruler is nearly as wide as the bottom of the frame. The king is dressed in a chiton which is drawn only sketchily. The chiton has a fold in the centre across the chest. The head is depicted in three-quarters view with deep-set eyes, a projecting chin and hollow cheeks. The left ear has been very carefully shaped. The hairline on the forehead is covered by a fillet from which two streamers hang down the neck and over the left shoulder. The hair is carefully indicated with its short locks falling over the fillet at the temples and covering it from there onwards. Two locks on the forehead curl in a similar way to portrait heads of Alexander the Great."}
