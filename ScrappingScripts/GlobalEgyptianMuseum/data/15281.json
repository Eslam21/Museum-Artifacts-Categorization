The body of the uraeus is made of hammered gold inlaid with semiprecious stones set into cloisonne. The head is made of lapis lazuli, while the eyes are made of garnet. The neck is decorated with lapis lazuli, feldspar, and carnelian. The golden tail has two looping turns and two ringlets are attached to the back of the snake's body for attaching it to the crown or the headdress.
