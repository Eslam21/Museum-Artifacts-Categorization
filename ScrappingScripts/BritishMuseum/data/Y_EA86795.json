{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86795"], "Description": [" Complete seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The rear shows one side with very clear impressions of two smaller rows of basketry coil and another side with one larger row of basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side bears an impression of a complete small oval scarab-like seal and some finger impressions above it. The motif shows a Hathor sistrum (Y8) with a standing part like a nb-basket. Left and right at the base each an upright uraeus facing to the outsides. Very finely carved, even the eyes of Hathor are partly visible.
