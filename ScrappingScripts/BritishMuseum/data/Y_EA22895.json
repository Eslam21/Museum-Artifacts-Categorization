{"artifact_name": "necklace; bead; pendant; amulet", "Object Type": [" necklace ", " bead ", " pendant ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA22895"], "Description": [" A string composed of spherical and bicone beads of amethyst, of a dark colour, and a gold pendant in the form of a standing hawk. The hawk was once inlaid with coloured stones or glass but now only traces of some cement remain. The head, body and outer tail feathers are all in one piece with a partition made from a strip of sheet gold dividing the head from the body. The lower tail feathers are formed from a separate cloison. The legs, notched to indicate the ribbing of the bird's legs, are tubes. The feet are separate piece of twisted wire representing the claws. The bird stands on a bar which is an open 'box' made of sheet gold. On the reverse, details of the beak, eye, and leg feathers are indicated in repouss\u00e9. There is no surface decoration, however. One claw overlaps the bar on the reverse. A tube for suspension is soldered at the bird's shoulder level, notched with four lines representing separate rings. There are no signs of wear on it. Flecks of silver impurities are visible in the open cloison of the bird's body.
