Infantrymen with helmets and tunics identified as Mycenaeans by Louise Schofield (see bibliography). 74100, 74101, 74102 were excavated by Pendlebury on 1st Dec. 1936 (cf. City of Akhnaten III, 142) and sent to England in small box marked R 43.2 (given by Liverpool). On return they were `temporarily lost' (Fairman, letter to EES), but by 1954 they had been given to Fairman for study and publication. After his death the pieces he had mounted disappeared until 1992; small (unplaced) fragments remained in Liverpool with the box. At the purchase of the mounted fragments, these were distributed to the Museum. ", " Publication: Parkinson & Schofield in Davies-Schofield, Egypt, the Aegean and the Levant, 125-6, pl. 8.
