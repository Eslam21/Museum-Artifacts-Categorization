According to Beazley, face kantharoi are doubtless East Greek, not Attic (ARV 1697, emending 1529, 7); he notes that Kunze, unpublished, had already suggested this. Johnston 1978 took it for Attic (contra J. Frel, pers.comm.). On a Samian production place, see Walter-Karydi 1973, 485. H. Mommsen has since analysed the clay and suggests an Attic provenance; fine, dense, hard fired orange-brown clay with very little mica and some small white lime inclusions (Munsell 5YR 7/6). The result is treated in U. Schlotzhauer's treatment of face-kantharoi in Maeander (Festschrift for V. von Graeve), 2006, 240-1 and in Schlotzhauer (2012) he suggests that the kantharos may have been produced in Attica by an immigrant Milesian potter.
