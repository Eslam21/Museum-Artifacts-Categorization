XXXVII, no. 68). The scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII C, subtype C10-15, see especially C11 for this piece) and produced in Naukratis (on the various productions of the 'Scarab Factory', see Webb forthcoming). Gorton identified the motif as a debased inscription, possibly mentioning the name men-ib-Ra - which should be corrected in Menekhib, the Horus name of Psamtek II - or wah-ib-Ra (Gorton 1996, 106). This debased inscription could also be a play between the name of the god Amun-Ra written in a cryptic way (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) and the name of the pharaoh Wahibre, likely to be Apries since the activity of the 'Scarab Factory' is mainly dated to 600-570 BC. Petrie illustrated a number of different versions for this type of inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 65-70).
