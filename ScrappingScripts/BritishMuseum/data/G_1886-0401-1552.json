Lemos describes this sherd as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration (Lemos 1991, 72-3). However, it must be noted that the joining sherd 1886,0401.1559 shows a greater portion of the interior decoration and it is more elaborate than what 1886,0401.1552 displays. The presence of interior decoration on the joining sherd suggests that the sherd is late in the Wild Goat Style and may mark a transition to the Mature Animal Style. Furthermore, the joining sherd 1886,0401.1559 falls into Lemos's Group of Chalices with Dotted Concentric Circles because of the decoration around the handle zone and between the handles (Lemos, 1991, 70). Therefore, this sherd falls into that category. ", " 'A\u03a0' is written in pencil on the interior surface of the sherd. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
