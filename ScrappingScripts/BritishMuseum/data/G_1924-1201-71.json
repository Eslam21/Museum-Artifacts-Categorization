The decoration on both sherds is the same, and so the tendril decoration on British Museum 1924,1201.71 is an extension from a horizontal handle. The fabric and decorative techniques find parallels with British Museum 1888,0601.644.c. This sherd was analysed with NAA by Hans Mommsen (Bonn). The origin of the fabric (NAUK 47) was not identified and considered a chemical singleton."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GL.074)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.71"]}
