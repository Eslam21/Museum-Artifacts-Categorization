", " Marked in red pen \"16\". Figure plaque of woman with a child to her right. Unprovenanced parallel in the Petrie Museum (UC30199) which may be from same mould series. Parallel from Naukratis, of woman with child (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA576). Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late Period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites, thought examples with a child are less common. Parallels are generally dated to the Late Period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt and thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.109, nos 203-9, particularly no.205; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, pl. 50.1-5, nos 263-7, particularly no. 264; Weber 1914, no.199; Petrie 1909, pl.35.7 and 12 from Memphis; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69,3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 clear with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and the Temple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Amarna (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888,0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, (SCA), (unpublished).
