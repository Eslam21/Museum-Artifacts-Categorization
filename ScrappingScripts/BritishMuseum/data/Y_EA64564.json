{"artifact_name": "statuette", "Object Type": ["statuette"], "Museum number": ["EA64564"], "Description": [" Bronze statuette of Tuthmosis IV: Thutmosis IV is depicted in an offering pose, kneeling and holding two large 'nw'-pots forward at just above waist height. He wears the 'nemes' headdress with a uraeus cobra, its head missing, which rises just above the forehead band. Its body forms two asymmetrical curves at the front of the king's head, then runs straight over the top to the crown of the head. The modeling of the king's torso is indistinct - made more so by the overcleaning of the surface of the bronze. The traditional royal 'shendyt' kilt is belted by a wide diamond-patterned belt, in the central rectangle of which the hieroglyphic signs of the king's prenomen, written without a cartouche, are somewhat awkwardly inscribed. Distinctive facial features of Thutmosis IV are clearly incorporated in this small statuette: high cheekbones and a square jaw, a brow line flat near the nose, narrow almond-shaped eyes, a long nose that broadens at the nostrils nearly to the width of his mouth, and an upper lip that is thicker and more prominent than the lower. The brow and eye-rim inlays, partly missing, are apparently silver, and the sclera of the eye is calcite, painted black to mark the iris.
