The decoration of the top part is, as Kinch observed, like that of the 'Vroulian' amphora Karlsruhe B.2311 (Kinch, op. cit., fig. 69, and see pp. 187-90; Zervos, op. cit., fig. 303; CVA ii, pl. 345. 5). Three-reeded handles occur in Group B (no. 1), but the other handles of Group C are four-reeded. The abnormal upper panels, the long handles, and the number of reeds suggest that this situla belongs to the beginning of Group C. Kinch, op. cit., fig. 71.
