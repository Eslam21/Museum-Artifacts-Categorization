Behind it sit the deities Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, and Thoth. In the third register the deceased stands on the right with arms raised in adoration before an altar piled with offerings, and topped by a lotus-flower. Behind it stand Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Thoth, Anubis, and Wepwawet. Four lines of text in the fourth register carry a prayer to Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, Anubis, and Wepwawet on behalf of the sistrum-player of Amun-Ra Taheb, daughter of the God's Father priest P\u0292-d\u1ec9-'lmn-nb-nswt-t\u0292wy and T\u0292-d\u1ec9-nfr-\u1e25tp. The lower corners of the stela are left unpainted for pedestals which are now wanting. On the back beneath a canopy appears the sun in the horizon with its rays flanked on the left by the standard of the East and on the right by the standard of the West. The stela is split down the centre where the two planks of wood of which it is composed adjoin. The surface is worn and cracked in places and some of the colours have faded. The stela is bordered on all sides by a red strip. On three sides there are borders of white, blue, white, multi-coloured rectangles consisting of blue, red, blue, and green separated by one black and two white stripes, and white. The background of the stela is yellow. The upper register has a red and white border at the top. The disk is red while the uraei have white tails with black dots, blue upper bodies, and crowns of red and yellow with black outlines respectively. The wings are tripartite: the upper feathers are indicated in black on a white background with red dots in the centre and blue tips; the middle have red feathers on a white background bordered by white lines; while the lower feathers are green with black outlines and tips. The jackals are black with red sashes and red and blue flags and sceptres. The text is black between blue dividing lines. The first and second register are separated by five borders which are white, multicoloured composed of blue, red, blue and green squares separated by white squares, white, multi-coloured consisting of blue, red, blue, and green ovals on a white background, and white. There is a similar series of borders between the second and third register. There is a blue sky at the top of the second register.
