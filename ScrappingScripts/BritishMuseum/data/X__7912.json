", " Dome-shaped weights are very close to the cupcake-shaped ones; they just do not show a sharp edge, or strong carination. Such type is one of the most common weights found in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201cdomed\u201d type), and elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 26). Dome-shaped weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples. This specimen however is linked to another standard (around 6.4 g) which is difficult to define. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
