{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "58", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY (not before); 27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GREYWACKE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "59.5 cm", "Width": "18.5 cm", "Depth": "27.8 cm", "Name": "Unfinished statue", "Description": "This very coarsely modelled statue depicts a kneeling man holding a naos in front of him. The coarseness of the statue is particularly visible at the sides. The arms are shapeless and angular but the skull has already been rounded. The back pillar had already been smoothed, which is strange when the state of the rest of this statue is taken into account."}
