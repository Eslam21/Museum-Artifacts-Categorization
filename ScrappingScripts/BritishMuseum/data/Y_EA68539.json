{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA68539"], "Description": [" Limestone ostracon: with a a sketch drawing in black ink of a red jungle fowl rooster, on one side only. The strutting cock displays a well-developed erect comb with four points. The beak is slightly exaggerated in length and curves upward. Below and to the left of the eye is an indication of the ear and lobe. Wattles are shown at the neck, and saddle feathers appear at the end of the wing. A spur projects from each leg, but no talons are represented. The tail appears in two parts; the upper portion, drawn with heavy lines, represents the sickle feathers, and the lower portion indicates the lesser sickle feathers and tail coverts.

Whether the drawing actually represents a domestic bird is a matter of some debate, since chickens were not well known in Egypt until about 50 B.C. It seems possible, however, that the sketch shows a domestic fowl of the type mentioned in the Annals of King Thutmose III, a bird of a foreign land that \"gives birth every day.\" The Egyptians left a tremendous amount of documentation regarding the animals and birds they knew and used, and it is likely that, since it is hardly represented, the domestic chicken may have been known only rarely during the New Kingdom and perhaps even died out soon after its introduction.
