The head, which has a false beard, is distinguished by its large eyes and the red-brown skin colour. Khonstefnakht wears a blue and white striped wig and on his chest is a broad collar. The body of the coffin is covered with representations of divinities in two registers, and with hieroglyphic inscriptions in vertical columns. The first register shows an illustration of the famous chapter 125 of the 'Book of the Dead', perhaps better known as 'the weighing of the heart'. In the second register, the god Anubis is shown embalming the body of the deceased which lies on a funerary bed. The right-hand scene shows the god Re-Harakhty in the solar barque. The interior of the lid is covered with a figure of the goddess Nut, accompanied by 24 genies who represent the 12 hours of the day and the 12 of the night."}
