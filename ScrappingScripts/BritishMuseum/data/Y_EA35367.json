It is of simple but competent workmanship, with flesh and hoes painted red, and wig, facial details and inscription coloured black. The text, inscribed in four lines, is a short version of the shabti spell from Chapter 6 of the 'Book of the Dead'; it lacks the phrases in which the shabti is instructed to work on behalf of its owner.
