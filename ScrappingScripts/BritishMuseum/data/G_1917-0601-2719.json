{"artifact_name": "necklace", "Object Type": ["necklace"], "Museum number": ["1917,0601.2719"], "Description": [" Gold necklace with crescent pendant: the necklace consists of a strap of four loop-in-loop chains linked. The ends are clamped into neat tongue-shaped terminals ending in a ring; the actual clasp elements are lost. The terminals have a border of beaded wire and are decorated with a stylised 'uraeus' 7 mm long. The crescent pendant hangs on a ribbed ring. Soldered to the ring is a 'uraeus' matching those on the terminals and a tiny gold disc bearing a rosette of seven gold grains, matching another pair soldered to the tips of the crescent. The arms of the crescent have a lozenge-shaped cross-section and taper slightly. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Roman"], "Production date": ["50-150"], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Egypt (?)

Crescentic pendants were frequently associated with chains which fasten with a wheel-shaped or domed-disc clasp, possibly indicating a combined lunar/solar symbolism. The type was still current in the province of Britain as late as the middle of the second century: a jeweller's workshop hoard from Snettisham (Norfolk), consisting of locally made silver jewellery, includes crescent pendants and both wheel-shaped and domed clasps (Johns 1996, 92-4; Johns 1997, nos 317-23, 326-8). The deposition of this hoard is dated by the coins to AD 154/5 or later. Compare also a necklace from the Fayum, now in Baltimore, in which a chain with a Medusa-head medallion also carries a small crescent and two Isis busts: it is likely to be of late second-century date (Stefanelli 1992, no. 145, fig. 198). Though the necklace described here is unprovenanced, the use of the 'uraeus' as a decorative detail is a strong indication that it was made in Egypt. Bibliography: F. H.
