It is noticeable that with the progress of time the reservoirs of oil lamps were getting larger, to store more oil for light. It became more comfortable and safer to carry a lamp, as the handle is at the back instead of on the side as in older lamps. Byzantine oil lamps had simple decorations, as these lamps demonstrate. The decoration is represented by dots within small circles, zigzag lines or circular lines. One oil lamp has broken handles. The handles are usually broken in oil lamps for they are the most fragile parts of the lamps."}
