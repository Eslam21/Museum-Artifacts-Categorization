", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. Cats are usually associated with the goddess Bastet, a deity particularly revered in Lower Egypt (Kessler 1989, 150-154). The goddess was linked with fertility but also festivity and drunkenness (Andrews 1994, 32). Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). Even if they appear already previously, amulets of cat started to be very popular with the Third Intermediate Period (on amulets of cat in general: Andrews 1994, 12, 33-34; Herrmann et al. 2010, 89-90).
