{"artifact_name": "counter", "Object Type": ["counter"], "Museum number": ["1890,0601.167"], "Description": [" Bone or ivory counter with a portrait of a North African man: the counter is intact, but the surface is slightly scratched and discoloured. The counter bears a portrait in relief of a balding man, the hair clinging to the back of his skull rendered in tight, short curls. The man has a prominent brow, pronounced cheekbones and a bony face. These features contrast with his large, fleshy nose and lips. The advanced age of the subject is indicated by his scrawny neck and slightly sagging flesh. The bust shows traces of drapery over his shoulders. The facial features appear to represent a man of North African descent. On the reverse, are the Roman numerals XIII then, in Greek, the name \u0393IAPAITONIN and beneath that the letters I\u0393.
