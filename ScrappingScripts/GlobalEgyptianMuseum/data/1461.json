{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8388", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK ?", "Category": "PAPYRUS", "Material": "PAPYRUS", "Technique": "DOVETAIL (JOINT); DRAWING; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Height": "44 cm", "Name": "The Book of the Dead of Tacheritmontu", "Description": "The papyrus of Tacheritmontu, sistrum player of Amun, measures a total of about 238 cm long and 44 cm high. The beginning is missing and the end is badly damaged. The document, which dates from the Ptolemaic Period, contains many chapters and vignettes of the Book of the Dead. The fragment E.8388/E (see photo) reproduces, besides the text and the vignette of Chapter 162, the famous Judgement of the Dead scene. The deceased is met in the audience chamber by two ladies who each carry a feather on their heads which symbolises Maat, the goddess of justice. On the left thrones Osiris, accompanied by the four Sons of Horus who are seated on a large lotus flower. In his capacity as supreme judge, the king of the Afterlife is assisted by a collection of fourty two assessors who are represented at the top of the two registers. The essential part of the process is made up by the \"weighing of the heart\" or the \"psychostasy\": on one side of the weighing scales, erected in the middle of the room, the gods Anubis and Horus have placed the heart of the deceased, on the other an image of the goddess Maat. Thoth, the god of writing, records the result of the weighing and the decision of Osiris. A monstrous animal is seated on a piece of furniture in the form of a small chapel, ready to devour the dead if the verdict, pronounced by the divine court, is unfavourable to him."}
