", " In addition to glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids, the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 at Naukratis was also producing amulets (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming; see also Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Petrie listed a number of amulet-moulds found at the Scarab Factory including moulds for wedjat eyes of different types (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 16-17). Several moulds used to produced wedjat eye amulets of the same type were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1920.0417.1, BM 1896,0610.31 and BM 1888,0601.748 (made from same master?). This example was discovered along with several moulds during Hogarth's excavation in 1903. According to Hogarth's list of antiquities from that year (list of Box 1), it came from the Hellenion area. Hogarth actually referred to North East town, including the Hellenion and an industrial area to the East. Could that be evidence for a second workshop in that area? These moulds do not differ from the ones discovered in the Scarab Factory area. Gorton, A.
