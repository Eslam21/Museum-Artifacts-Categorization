Vases) pulling the hair of the one in front. So far as can be judged the other slim amphorae are of the same shape, except that the lip may be grooved and that the handles may reach lower down the body (e.g. Pl. GB 586.3). They are decorated on the same system. BMC B.107. H. B. Walters, History of Ancient Pottery i, pl. 25. 1. E. Pfuhl, Malerei und Zeichnung iii, fig. 142. F. Dummler, Jdl 1895, 39 fig. 2.
