{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA36438"], "Description": [" Steatite striding figure of a male official on a slim rectangular base. He wears a short cropped wig with a cross-hatched pattern that also covers his ears. His eyes are narrowed and slightly asymmetrical, with a heavy upper eyelid. His eyebrows are arched and slope down to the temple, while his nose is slim with a slightly bulbous tip. His mouth is wide with thick lips that appear pursed together. His face is rounded and fleshy, with a notable bulging of flesh under the chin and around his extremely broad neck. His upper body is bare, with a subtle horizontal ridge delineating the chest area and a narrowed waist. His arms are placed by his sides and he appears to hold an object in each hand, possibly a piece of folded cloth. He wears a pleated shendyt kilt belted at the waist, and his left leg advances ahead of the right leg. On the reverse is a short back-pillar which is uninscribed. There are slight scratches across the upper body and small abrasions to the edges of the statue base. The figure is now placed on a modern rectangular base.
