{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:18", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Height": "13.5 cm", "Diameter": "5 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Wavy-necked jar, containing grains of cereal. Although doubtless used as tableware for some edible commodity, the precise function of this type of vessel remains uncertain. In this example the contents might have been added in the nineteenth century. The form is attested from the Middle Kingdom, but the pigment suggests a later date. Cobalt blue was only used in Egypt in the late 18th Dynasty, and only to paint pottery. This short timespan may reflect a brief period of increased trade with Mycenean Greece, if the cobalt was procured in Europe."}
