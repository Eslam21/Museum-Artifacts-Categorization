The three moulded beads with spiral decoration are of blue-green glazed composition. The long cylindrical beads of uneven lengths and roughly broken at the ends are blue, green and dark-purple. There are two green oblate beads, a single dark-green very long truncated convex bicone and a dark-green barrel. The two amulets, one of green glazed composition, the other of blue with a knob of green, are virtually unidentifiable.
