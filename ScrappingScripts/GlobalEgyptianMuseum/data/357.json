{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.2386", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS ?", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "18.2 cm", "Width": "19.3 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Fragment of stela", "Description": "This fragment of a limestone stela combines two types of monuments: the ear-stelae and the stelae carrying the representation of the pharaoh slaughtering his enemies. The first category consists of the private documents drawn up to arouse the attention of a god - here Ptah - to the request or to the prayer of the dedicant.  The function of the second category is a lot less clear: the stela seems to be a substitute for the pylon of a temple decorated with a scene of the massacre acting as a religious relief easily accessible to the people not allowed into the sacred places (see also E.4499).
