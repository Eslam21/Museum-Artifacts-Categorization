{"artifact_name": "finger-ring; scarab", "Object Type": [" finger-ring ", " scarab "], "Museum number": ["EA57698"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring set with lapis lazuli scarab; name of Intef on base. A lapis lazuli scarab: with details of the head alone marked, set in a gold funda as a ring bezel. Three holes are drilled at each side of the scarab, and two more, one at each end of the body. Into the side holes fit legs of gold wire which are joined to the rim of the funda. The funda itself is made from a plate of sheet gold with a rim around it. At either end are soldered rings to protect the scarab. The shank which goes under the scarab between its body and the funda looks as though it might be made from a piece of beaten wire rather than from a tube made from a strip of wire. Thin twisted gold wire is wound around the upper part of the shank on both sides of the scarab; one of the wires goes through the scarab to hold it in position. Silver impurities can be seen on the gold rim of the funda. On the base of the gold funda is inscribed the name Intef, not in a cartouche.

However, since this ring and the bracelet spacers with cats (1924.1215.2) were all in the Dyson Perrins Collection, it may be that the Intef of the ring is the same Intef as that of the spacers, ie Nubkheperre Inyotef.
