The false door consists of the false door proper with two lines of text on each side containing the titles of Ptahshepses, flanked on both sides by panelled walls carrying the biographical inscription of Ptahshepses in which he describes his birth in the time of Mycerinus, his marriage to Khamaat, a princess and daughter, probably, of Shepseskaf, and his career under four further kings, continuing down, probably, to Nyuserre of the Fifth Dynasty. All the texts on the false door are carved in good sunk relief, very sharply cut. On each side of the door is a long panel bearing representations of food-offerings, carved in fine low relief. The architrave is complete and in good condition. The false door is generally in good condition apart from a few small places where the surface is rubbed. The false door was painted a mottled pink to simulate granite and most of this colour remains. The hieroglyphs were painted green. On the side panels many of the vessels and parts of other objects were painted red; traces of green remain on some of the vegetables and floral offerings. No other colour can now be discerned. There is no colour on the architrave.
