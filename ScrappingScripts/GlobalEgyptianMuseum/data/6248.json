In the centre, a rather wide braid with about 10 twists of the three strands of hair (5,5 cm long, 1 cm thick). On one of the sides, this braid is divided up into two smaller and very tight braids. The first of these smaller braids corresponds to one strand divided in three. The second is composed of two strands. These two smaller braids are cut short (2 cm in length, 0,5 cm in thickness). The large middle braid ends because two of the strands of hair are shorter than the third strand by 4 cm (0,2 cm)."}
