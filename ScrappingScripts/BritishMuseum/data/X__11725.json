Asiatic looking male figurines date to between the mid 7th and the late 6th century BC, with very close parallels from Cyprus, probably from the Arsos workshops (Karageorghis 1995, 19-21, Type I(ii)38, pl. 9.3). V. Karageorghis argues the \u2018Assyrian\u2019 look may coincide with Assyrian domination of Cyprus during the 7th century BC (Karageorghis 1995, 21). Under the number 1911.44, a mixed batch of objects were originally registered; the sub-numbers were assigned on 11.5.2000. This figurine is labelled in pencil TA\u03a612 (although the characters are worn, they are clear), designating this as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886.
