{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA60588"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone head of Osiris, the body and base now missing. Osiris wears the tall feathered atef-crown with a raised outline of the uraeus cobra body across the front of the crown. His ears stick out from underneath the feathered edges. The eyes are slanted and narrow, with thick flat eyebrows set close to the eyes and a slim nose p. The mouth is small with sharply incised lips, and the outer corners pulled up high. Though damaged from the chin, it is likely that the god also wore a divine false beard. On the reverse is a large broad back-pillar, its round top reaching to the tip of the god\u2019s crown. It does not appear to be inscribed. A large chip to the centre of the crown is visible on the right side, and at the right side feather there is also another chip to the stone just above the ear. There are small chips to the stone around the edges of the ostrich feathers on either side. The figure is now attached to a small modern base.
