{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "55.82.3", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "BENI HASSAN", "Category": "PAPYRUS BOAT (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Height": "39 cm", "Name": "Model of boat", "Description": "This wooden model of a sailing ship represents an original built up from bundles of reeds bound together. The hull is white with red banding. The small canopy in front of the steersman is supported by four slender lotus columns and was originally shaded with a linen screen. The steersman guides the double steering oars by means of a lever which serves the purpose of a tiller. The mast consists of a pair of spars meeting at the top where they are bound together. Three men are positioned around the mast, hoisting the large square sail. A look-out man stands in the bow with his arms outstretched, behind him another pair of sailors use punt poles. The painted bows and stern of this boat imitate the type of craft used by fishermen in the marshes, which would have been made from bound papyrus bundles. The small open-topped canopy sheltered the owner from the sun, a design unique to this model. "}
