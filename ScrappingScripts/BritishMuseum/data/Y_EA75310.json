Pmansholk (l. 18) is otherwise attested only in a papyrus from Bawit. This document is structured like a loan agreement. It seems likely, however, that it was connected with tithe or 'pactum' collection because it mentions the phrase 'the places which belong to', the word 'neighbourhood', and begins with 'anok pason NN eishai', all features of tithe collection documents."], "Bibliographic references": [" Clackson 2000 / Coptic and Greek Texts relating to the Hermopolite Monastery of Apa Apollo (p.12, 72-4, pl.11) ", " Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (86578) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/86578) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair (incomplete)"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Hatre ", " Named in inscription: George ", " Named in inscription: Mena "], "Associated places": [" Named in inscription: Monastery of Apa Apollo "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Christie's"], "Acquisition date": ["1996"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA75310"], "Registration number": ["1996,0608.10"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: P.Mon.Apollo 20 "], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 20 Jul 2005 ", " Treatment: 23 Apr 1998 "]}
