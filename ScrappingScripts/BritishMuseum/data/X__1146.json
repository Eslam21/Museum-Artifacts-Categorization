", " East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of a Classical Greek type (broadly 500BC-425BC). The fabric and style is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Various parallels, possibly from same mould, from Naukratis (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA350 joins NA355; NA354 joins NA353; NA390 joins NA850, NA426, NA802, NA803 and NA509). Close parallels, probably from the same mould, from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.120, no.2525, who notes three copies from the same mould, Type B2) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 238, GR1885, 1213.41). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the early and late 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
