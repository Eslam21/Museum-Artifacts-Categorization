Its does not bear a slip and its colour varies from light pink-beige to dark beige. The slender profile is marked by a rather strong inflexion in its lower section. The surface is irregular and uneven and also strewn with blemishes as a result of firing. Like many others, this vessel, which was found in an A-Group tomb, demonstrates the importance of trade between Upper and Lower Nubia during the end of the Predynastic period in Egypt. Vessels of this type, called ''wine jars'' by researchers, were used by the Egyptians to transport food products to Nubia. They were thereafter used by Nubians, who appreciated the technical qualities of the vessels and did not hesitate to place them in their tombs."}
