{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85620"], "Description": [" Waist to mid-legs of a hand-modelled female clay figurine, broken at both ends. The figure may have been seated, but if so it was leaning back at a marked angle. A relatively large pubic triangle is marked by three thickly incised lines, while on the reverse the buttocks are large and carefully shaped. The hips taper in towards the waist, which would have been quite narrow. The figure has been modelled in two strips and joined vertically, the join smoothed along the front face but not along the reverse so that it delineates the buttocks and legs here, but also continues along the lower back. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica.
