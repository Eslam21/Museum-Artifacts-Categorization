The rim and interior paint find parallels with Samian Hera cups. However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has a graffito. Other similar mugs were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera or, probably, Samos. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405, but especially 1888,0601.404 which is very close in fabric and profile. For parallels with another similar mug with a graffito inscription, see Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.227.1899."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.899) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Hera/Juno"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.328"]}
