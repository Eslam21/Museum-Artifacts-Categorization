{"artifact_name": "knife", "Object Type": ["knife"], "Museum number": ["EA66064"], "Description": [" A well preserved serrated knife of copper: tapering to a rounded tip. The tang at the butt is of square section, measuring 4.3 cm in length. The teeth have all been cut out from the same side of the blade; consequently they are not 'set' as in a modern saw, and they are extensively worn. A thin layer of corrosion covers parts of the blade. Close to the butt on one side is an incised inscription of three hieroglyphs, partly hidden by the corrosion products.
