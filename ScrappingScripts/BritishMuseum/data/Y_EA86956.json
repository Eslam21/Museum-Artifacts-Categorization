The fragment is showing impressions of two rows of basketry coil on one side of the rear and another coil on the second side, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The top is flat with slightly bending sides and shows an impression of a large oval scarab-like seal that is only partly preserved. The middle of the seal a scarab underneath a sun-disc, flanked on both sides with an i rod, on the left the beginning of another sign preserved, probably a boat that frames the motif underneath.
