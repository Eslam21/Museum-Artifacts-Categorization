{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37525"], "Description": [" A fragmentary hollow terracotta figure of Harpokrates, standing, with his finger to his mouth. A cornucopia is in the crook of the left arm; drapery falls over his left shoulder and over a herm upon which he leans. It is very indistinct - the details of the head of the herm are not clear, but indications of its genitals show that it is indeed a herm and not a pier. Harpokrates appears to have a full head of hair and a side-lock; he apparently has a wreath, and wears a Double Crown. Back plain; small circular vent. The right side of the figure is lost. Two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with a brown surface. Traces of a white dressing survive inside. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Roman Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
