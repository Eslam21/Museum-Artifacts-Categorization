{"artifact_name": "figure-mould", "Object Type": ["figure-mould"], "Museum number": ["EA46704"], "Description": [" A white plaster rear-mould for a terracotta standing figure of Sarapis. He probably does not wear a chiton, but certainly has a himation over the impression\u2019s left shoulder. At the front, the missing mould would probably have shown the himation falling down from the left shoulder, while the other end of this mantle covered him from the waist down, its rolled upper edge is caught up by his left lower arm and hanging by his side. The right arm was probably made separately and applied. He wears a modius, apparently with floral decoration; the hair is long. The rear of the right foot appears in this mould, and seems to be sandalled or booted. On the edges are six registration bosses to align the two moulds. There is slight damage to the bottom and to the rounded back of the mould.
