{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 38486", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "MODEL", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Model of a Cow", "Description": "The wooden model of a standing cow is carved from a single piece of wood. A peg at the bottom of each hoof was intended to attach the figure to a rectangular base. The body is painted to imitate the natural skin of the animal. Individual models of cows are not very common in ancient Egyptian art, so this cow may have been part of a butchery or cattle-counting scene. The deceased possibly hoped to use it in the hereafter as an offering."}
