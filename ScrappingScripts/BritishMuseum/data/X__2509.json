", " Falcons are often associated with Horus, though various deities and the pharaoh himself can assume a falcon form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54); the identification of the deity represented is even harder in the case of amulets (Andrews 1994, 27-28; on various types of falcon amulets: Herrmann et al. 2010, 103-104). Amulets representing a crowned falcon in glazed composition appear in the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 28). For a similar amulet from Naukratis: Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.896. Falcon deity with a double crown could be a representation of Horus of Pe whose cult is well known in Sais. Numerous amulets of falcons, made out of bronze, glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). This amuletic figure with the the double crown is a variant to a common class of glazed composition figures in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. II, 9). They were probably produced locally, maybe at the Scarab Factory itself (Webb forthcoming). On these falcon figures, also found in Rhodes where such type was also produced: Webb 1978, 94-96, nos 533-534 (from Rhodes, Kamiros and Ialysus).
