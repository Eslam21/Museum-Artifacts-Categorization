{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7126", "Dating": "NAQADA II (not before); NAQADA III (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "SERPENTINITE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "2 cm", "Name": "Bull's head amulet", "Description": "Although the horns are not explicitly rendered, this small stone (serpentine) amulet is almost certainly related to similarly shaped amulets (see E.2335) that are assumed to depict the head of a bull. The eyes are rendered by deep indentations and were perhaps originally inlaid. The object is bored through horizontally on the back. The exact significance of such amulets is unknown but they are frequently found in burials and at settlement sites. Perhaps it is a royal (?) symbol expressing physical strength and/or fertility."}
