", " According to Lemos, sphinxes on Chalice Style vases are usually facing left. It is quite possible that a sphinx facing right may be part of an antithetical composition, and so if this sherd is part of an antithetical composition, then the vessel should perforce belong in the Group of Antithetical Sphinxes. Pots in this group are both stylistically and chronologically early. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it was found that the fabric originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones with J.Boardman in Jones 1986, p.286).
