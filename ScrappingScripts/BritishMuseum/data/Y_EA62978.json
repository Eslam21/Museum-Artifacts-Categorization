{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA62978"], "Description": [" Fragmentary black granite head of a male figure, the body of the statue and base now missing. The figure is depicted with a simple smooth wig, set low on the forehead and tucked behind the oversized ears. The wig is now broken off above the neck but may have originally extended towards the chest. The eyes are wide and almond shaped, with a thin incised line above the eye conveying the upper eyelid and the appearance of slightly sunken skin underneath the eye area. The eyebrows are faint and curve downward at the temples. The nose is narrow at the top and broadens out at the nostrils, with a distinct cupid\u2019s bow above the upper lip. The mouth is wide with thick lips, with the lower lip sharply incised along the edge and both lips pursed together to create a slight pout. The outer corners of the mouth slope slightly downwards, conveying a more serious facial expression. The face is rounded and fleshy particularly around the jawline=. In addition to the break at the neck of the figure and loss of the ends of the wig on either side, the nose and left side cheek have been damaged. The edges of the ears are also slightly chipped.
