Repaired from fragments with a number of pieces are missing from the sides. Made from a compact micaceous green marl clay. The interior and exterior were covered by a smooth slip, the colour of which varies from pale green to cream. This was probably burnished originally, as traces of spiral-pattern burnishing on the handle suggest.
