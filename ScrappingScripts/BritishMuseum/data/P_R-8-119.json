But not one of them gives any indication of their provenance on the verso. Given their relationship to the contemporary landscapes by Swanevelt, of which Cracherode possessed a fine group, one would expect that they all came from him, and may have been extracted from a small album in his library (which would explain the absence of markings). This is far more plausible than a Courten/Sloane provenance, but cannot be proven.(AVG)"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["R,8.119"]}
