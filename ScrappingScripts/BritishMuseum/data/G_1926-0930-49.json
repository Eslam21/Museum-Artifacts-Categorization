A standing figure, modelled in the round, of Socrates (or a comic actor playing a Socratic part). He wears a short tunic rolled down so that a swathe of drapery, held in his right hand, contains his large belly. A himation runs diagonally across his back over his right shoulder, gathered in his lowered left hand, with a few folds hanging below it; on his right side, the himation passes over his shoulder, is wound round his right arm, and falls to the ground at his side. The back is shown in lesser detail than the front; there is no plinth. Hollow; two-piece mould. Light orange-brown to buff clay with no visible mica, apparently a marl ware; traces of a black pigment (?) on the face and belly.
