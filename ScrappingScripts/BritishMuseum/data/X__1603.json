", " Same style, but from a different mould series as an unprovenanced parallel (Petrie Museum UC45805). Common figure plaque form found in Egypt in the Late period, but also found in the Levant at Phoenician sites. Parallels of these fertility figures are generally dated to the Late period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt. At Medinet Habu a Third Intermediate Period date is attributed to a similar piece without pillars (Teeter 2010, nos. 1 to 9 and 25 to 26), whilst at the Temple of Mut, Luxor, similar examples were tentatively dated to the New Kingdom (Waraksa 2009, no. 3). This type of figure is part of a long and deep rooted Egyptian tradition already prevalent in New Kingdom domestic religion confirmed by parallels in Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Armana (ibid.).
