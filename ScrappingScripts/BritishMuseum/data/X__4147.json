", " Note that the use of turquoise glaze is rare for this type of figure. The use of cream glaze with dark brown added glaze for details is more usual. Several amulets representing naked male and female figures in various postures were discovered in Naukratis, especially in the sanctuaries of Apollo and Aphrodite.
