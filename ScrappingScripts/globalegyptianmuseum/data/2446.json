{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1911:385", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF MENTUHOTEP NEBHEPETRE", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; PAINTED", "Width": "7.5 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Upper fragment of a stele", "Description": "Upper right part of a painted limestone votive stela, depicting the goddess Hathor. The horned sun-disc of the goddess survives at centre, with the hieroglyphs for the name and epithet 'Hathor lady of the necropolis'. The abraded or anciently erased figure(s) at right cannot easily be discerned, but the slanted red area may indicate the position of the arm of the devotee, extended towards the goddess in an act of offering, perhaps of libation. The stela was found in the area of the temple of king Nebhepetra Mentuhotep of the Middle Kingdom, adjacent to the principal shrine of Hathor at Thebes, on the West Bank at Deir el-Bahari, where numerous votive offerings to the goddess were left in the New Kingdom."}
