Some elements have been modelled separately: the bead necklaces on her neck and on her forehead, the earrings and the scarab on top of her head. All other details were added in paint. The red details of her face are noticeable because they contrast with the rather schematic rendering of the black eyes and brows. The broadly smiling mouth appears as if done in make-up. The ears have been painted in light brush strokes. The use of red for the nostrils and the corners of the eyes enhances the lifelike impression of the face. The red dot in between the eyebrows is an unusual element."}
