George Croly LLD, lithographed by Louis Haghe' (London, F.G.Moon, 1842). The plates were originally published uncoloured in 20 parts between 1842-5, and later reprinted coloured (tinted in one tint and hand-coloured for the rest). Abbey gives a full account of the history of the series. The BM set consists of the letterpress and 123 plates (of which one is a duplicate). Acquired bound in two volumes, it was then rebound in four. Each plate was given a separate register number. The order of the plates does not always follow that of Abbey, and two (Abbey 29 and 88) are lacking. Each plate (except 10) bears a cursive facsimile title in the plate, which often differ slightly from those given in the accompanying letterpress. Each plate is given a separate entry here, and the titles are those on the plate (which are also those given by Abbey). Part of the series was published separately in three volumes in 1846-1849, entitled 'Egypt and Nubia, / from drawings made on the spot by / David Roberts R.A. / With historical descriptions by / William Brockedon, F.R.S. / Lithographed by / Louis Haghe.', from which the BM has loose sheets in its collections."], "Bibliographic references": ["Abbey Travel / Travel in Aquatint and lithography 1770-1860 from the library of J.R.Abbey (385.2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Jerusalem "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Campbell Dodgson"], "Acquisition date": ["1915"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1915,0706.2"]}
