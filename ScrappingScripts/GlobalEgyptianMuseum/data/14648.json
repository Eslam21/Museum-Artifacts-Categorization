Medusa is depicted in her traditional shape, with her frightening eyes and prominent forehead from which two small wings emerge. The nose is large and wide. Her hair is thick and flows around the face. Snakes are coming out of her open mouth, two of which are twisted beneath the neck. A part below her face that juts out and an extended part above the head might have been used for hanging the Medusa or for using it as a handle. The general shape of the Medusa is similar to those depicted on the coffins and mosaics of Alexandria."}
