{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA69154"], "Description": [" Small round-topped limestone stela depicting a king smiting a kneeling figure before Ptah; a falcon flies above. The king wears a Nubian-style wig with a uraeus and a short projecting kilt. He strides forward with his right hand holding a khepesh, sickle-sword, raised above his head and his left hand grasping the hair of a foreign enemy. The foreigner, possibly a Nubian, is carved at a smaller scale, kneels with his hands upheld. On the right-hand side, the mummiform figure of the god Ptah wears a skull cap, holds a was-sceptre, symbolizing divine power, and stands on a plinth shaped like the hieroglyph for maat (order). A falcon, representing the god Horus, who was often identified with the king, flies above. The stela is roughly shaped and carved. The stone is discoloured in several places.

Scenes of the king in battle often adorned the outer walls of Egyptian temples, where they would be visible to everyone, demonstrating the king upholding order over chaos. The king is typically shown triumphing almost single-handedly against foreign enemies, whose distinctive appearance is intended to represent an entire foreign nation rather than particular individuals. The foreigner depicted here appears to have short hair and is clean shaven, suggesting that a Nubian may be represented.
