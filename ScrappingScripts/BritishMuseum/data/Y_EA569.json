{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA569"], "Description": [" Rectangular limestone stela of Sahathor: the stela was designed as a combination of a shrine and a false door. Architectural allusions include the cornice at the top and the figures of Sahathor, facing outward, in the thickness of the \"door\". Only here, in this protected area, was any of the original paint preserved. Along with the standard offering prayer at the top, the inscriptions contain texts of a type found on tomb walls. False door elements include the offering scene at the top, which is shared by Sahathor's wife, Meryisis, the arrangement of his inward facing figures below the columns of text above, and the statue itself, since the owner's figure is sometimes shown facing outward from the central \"doorway.\" A false door often had an offering table placed directly in front of it, and so did this.
