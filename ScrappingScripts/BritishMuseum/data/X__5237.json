", " If the identification of Nefertum is correct, this amulet belongs to a type of amulet relatively well represented in Naukratis, may the figure be in copper alloy, glazed composition or stone (Masson forthcoming). Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and at Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217).
