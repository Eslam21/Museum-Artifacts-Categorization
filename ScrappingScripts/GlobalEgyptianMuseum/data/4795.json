Over her tripartite wig lies the golden vulture's cap, and a broad collar composed of four rows covers her neck and shoulders. The tight dress, which is suspended by two shoulder straps, has a decoration of vulture wings wrapped around the body. The goddess holds a heka-scepter in her right hand together with an ankh-sign. A number of small-scale beings are painted around her, among which is a Ba-bird with a human head in frontal view and a figure of Anubis with a jackal's head. In addition, there are emblematic hieroglyphs rendered with much detail and in full colour. The goddess is the Mistress of the West, the necropolis, she is Isis who mourns the deceased Osiris. At the same time, she is Hathor as a goddess of heaven, giving life to the deceased."}
