A fat female being, seated with legs wide apart. She is largely naked, except for a sleeved tunic, and wears also an abbreviated garment over her pubic area. A ribbon crosses under her breasts and she has low boots or high sandals. She wears a necklace with a pendent bulla, and has double armlets over her sleeves. Her hair is parted in the centre, falling in Isis-locks onto her shoulders. She has a large tightly woven and bound wreath, the wide lappet-like ends of its ribbon resting on her shoulders. Lotus buds rise above the wreath, flanking a large bloom. The arms are bent at the elbow and both hands are raised just above her shoulders; the right hand holds an object that may be a looped garland, or possibly a cobra with rows of ventral shields, and the left hand holds a small pot. The back has a circular vent, and is treated summarily, but shows the hair in a bun with a wedge of pendent locks. Hollow; two-piece mould. Orange-brown to red clay, probably a marl ware, with some minute specks of mica.
