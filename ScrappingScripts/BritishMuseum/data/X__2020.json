", " Either 140 or 188 written unclearly on back in pencil. ", " Enthroned ithyphallic Harpocrates with one hand raised. This type was originally produced during the Late Period as a solid figure (British Museum GR 1973,0501.16 and in stone GR 2011,5011.15; Cambridge Fitzwilliam, E.81.1914, Cambridge MCA, NA596) and was subsequently made hollow in the 3rd century BC like other Ptolemaic figures (Bolton Museum 1886.31.23; British Museum GR 1973,0501.56; GR1973,0501.10; GR1973,0501.74). There is a fold above stomach, typical in Late Period statues (but see also Dunand 1990, no.258 from Tanis), and also on Ptah figures from Rhodes (see British Museum GR 1886,0401.1441 from Naukratis). Similar style with fold above stomach on Harpocrates figures of 6th to 4th century BC terracotta examples were found at Naukratis (Bailey 2008, no. 3206, see also 3205 from Smyrna) and figure from Temai el-Amohel (Cairo SR5/6362) and a mould confiscated in Alexandria (Cairo SR4/15902 TR18/1/81/10B). This is most similar to painted limestone figures from Naukratis (British Museum GR 2011,5011.15, see also GR 2011,5011.11).
