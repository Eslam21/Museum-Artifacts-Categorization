During the Roman and Byzantine periods, the type of mud stopper found at Antinoupolis was commonly used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, unlike the plaster examples (EA 53955, 53957\u201363) that were used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, type 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: type7). Egloff associates mud stoppers like those from Antinoupolis with late 4th\u20137th century AD amphora types, particularly LR 7 (Egloff 1977, no. 353, pl. 20). LRA7 amphorae date from the late 4th to the 7th or 8th century AD, though similar forms persist into the early Islamic period (Keay and Williams 2005, LRA7). Quadrupeds, especially donkeys, were a common device on Christian period plaster amphora stoppers found in Egypt at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.10), Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 28.16) and Naukratis (EA 27576), as well as on mud stoppers from Western Thebes (identified as a deer, Winlock and Crum, 80, fig. 33.16\u201317).
