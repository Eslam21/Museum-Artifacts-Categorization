", " More than a hundred votive boxes were discovered in Naukratis. The bulk of them originates from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Most of Naukratis votive boxes displayed a figure of a reptile particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (for example the lizard: Weiss 2012, 278). Petrie, W. M.
