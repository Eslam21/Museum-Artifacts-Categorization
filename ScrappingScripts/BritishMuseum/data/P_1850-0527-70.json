No.89. Also see exhib. LACMA 1988, cat. No.87. For discussion of print see Catherine Jenkins 'Lansdscape in the Fontainebleau school print', 'Print Quarterly', vol.23, 2006, p.37. The image derives from a combination of sources. The two figures were probably taken from Giulio, whereas D\u00fcrer's 'Virgin and Child with a Dragonfly' (1868,0822.180 and E,4.50) and 'St Eustace' (E,4.113 and 1868,0822.183) served as models for the landscape. Two related drawings of St Anthony (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rennes; inv. 2005.2.5) and St John (Biblioteca Reale di Torino; inv. 15809) show each figure on his own with no surrounding details.While these two drawings are not by Giulio himself, the poses of the two saints bear particular similarities to the figures he designed for the Duomo in Verona. Both the Rennes and Turin drawings, which show the figures in reverse with respect to their counterparts in the etching, are by the same accomplished hand \u2014 perhaps Primaticcio himself, as has been suggested by Cordellier, or an artist working in his circle (Cordellier, in 'De la Renaissance \u00e0 l'Age baroque. Une collection de dessins italiens pour les mus\u00e9es de France', Paris 2005, p, 132).
