{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.23"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art (pastoral period?) on the underside of a projecting rock shelf showing twenty-five human, fifteen cattle and two potential therianthrope figures and eight unidentified shapes in varying orientations and attitudes in a single large tableau. All the human figures are either light or dark brown, painted and infilled, while the cattle are mostly depicted with naturalistic or schematic coat pattern markings in infilled white, or brown and white bichrome, and with long white, upturned, lyre-shaped horns. The human figures are more concentrated on the left, and the cattle more on the right. To the far left centre of the image is a depiction of a human or therianthrope facing left with bent arms and infilled in light brown; the head which is possibly pointed and animal-like. In the centre of the tableau human figures are depicted in a variety of animated postures with legs and arms raised; some figures wear garments, personal ornamentation and hold unidentified loop-shaped objects as well as bows (?) On the right of the panel some cattle are represented in bichrome with patterned coat markings as well as outlined and infilled in white with upturned lyre-shaped horns. Karkur Talh, Egypt.

Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " cattle ", " therianthropism ", " garment ", " personal-ornament ", " mythical figure/creature ", " bird ", " arms/armour "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh ", " Topographic representation of: Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.23"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYKTA0020019 (TARA number) "]}
