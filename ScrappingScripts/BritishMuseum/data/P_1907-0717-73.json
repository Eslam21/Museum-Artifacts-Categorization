The saint is here at the centre and the rest of the composition is packed with beasts, monstrous and human figures, leaving no room at all for a definition of the background. The only hint of space being given by the stony floor in the foreground. The tormenting figures are all so close that the saint could have no way to escape, even if he wished to. He sits on a stone and his hands are joined together in prayer, with his left elbow leaning on a raised stone. He is completely naked and neither the pig, nor other attributes, are shown. He can be identified as St Antony because of the similarity in the description of his features with the others in the series (nos. 1907-7-17-42 to 74), especially with that in no. 1907-7-17-58, where the saint is also naked, but accompanied by his pig. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
