{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA51754"], "Description": [" The lower part of a hollow terracotta standing figure, very likely to be a woman, the feet close together on a minimal plinth. She is draped, the lower clothing curving in near the feet, and there is an over-garment with two long dangling tassels in the front. At the figure's left side is a long feature, perhaps part of the clothing: there may have been a symmetrical arrangement on the right side, but it is broken away. The back is plain. Two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt. Overall white dressing.
