{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86950"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows two coils of basketry on one side and three on the other suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. At the flat upper side an almost complete seal-impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible, the sides of the sealing are bending slightly downwards and show some finger impressions. The seal shows a circumferential line, inside a nb-basket at the bottom, on top of this a seated falcon. The falcon has both wings stretched in front of the body, is facing to the left and wears the double crown and a flagellum but with a slightly rounded end. The same seal is found on EA86941 and EA86944.
