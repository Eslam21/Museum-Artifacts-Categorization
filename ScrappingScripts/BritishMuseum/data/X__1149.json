", " Protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of early Classical Greek date (broadly 500BC to 400BC). The local Nile Delta fabric suggests this was produced in Naukratis, but in a Greek style. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, are dated between 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.120,Type B2) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, are dated to the 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, nos 237-9, 295). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
