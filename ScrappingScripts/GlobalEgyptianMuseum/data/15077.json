It is divided into three parts fixed together with an innovative technique of heavy copper-hinged joints. The central part folds inwards over the first section, while the third part folds outwards over the central one. Four extra legs are provided, hinged to fold inwards when the bed was closed for easy carrying and when used as a stool. The tightly woven papyrus string mattress is perfectly preserved. Four horizontal canes were placed under the leonine short legs to keep the bed up while in use."}
