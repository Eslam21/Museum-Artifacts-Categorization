Two similar sherds (British Museum 1965,0930.972.a and 1965,0930.972.d) were analysed with NAA by H. Mommson (Bonn). The fabrics were determined to be of the same origin but the source of the fabric was not determined. Dupont and Thomas (2006, p. 80) analysed a similar sherd (sample number NAU 55), to which they attributed a Vroulian style. According to the analysis of the fabric of the sherd, the precise region in eastern Greece from which the vase originated is unknown but Dupont and Thomas discard both a Rhodian and Nile Delta production. They suggest that the sherd probably has a Dorian provenance and also point out that it is highly unlikely that sherds were over-fired during production but rather were damaged as a result of an intense fire."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GM.23) (phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.972.q"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 1886,0401.1378 "]}
