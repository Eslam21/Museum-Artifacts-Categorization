Numbers of the same form were employed by Petrie to refer to the subsidiary graves, and Y.19 could stand for the grave marked 19 beside the tomb of Merneit, shown in 'Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties' I, pl.LXI. It is more likely that the inscribed fragment came from the main tomb rather than the subsidiary grave, but confusion could be caused if the same system of numbering occurs on less distinctive objects.
