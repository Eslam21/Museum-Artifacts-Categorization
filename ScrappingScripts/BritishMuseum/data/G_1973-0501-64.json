{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.64"], "Description": [" Terracotta ithyphallic Harpocrates figure with jar. A naked youth, modelled in the round and seated on a rectangular plinth, with his bent left leg on the ground and his right knee raised. His head is shaven except for a side-lock on the left side of his head, curving down his back. He has a large phallus, the glans resting on the ground in front of his left ankle. To his right side he holds an amphora with a substantial rim and grooved handles placed midway on its body. His left hand, placed below his chin, holds a long bag with narrow ends, perhaps a wineskin, slung over his shoulder. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with remains of a matt red slip applied overall to the figure, but not to the sides and underneath of the plinth; a thin black slip adorns the amphora, and two small traces of an overlying white dressing survive, painted pink.
