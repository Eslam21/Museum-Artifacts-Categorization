{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "178", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY (not before); SETHOS I/MENMAATRE ?; 19TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "120 cm", "Width": "70.2 cm", "Depth": "13 cm", "Name": "Stela of Amenhotep", "Description": "This rectangular stela with a cavetto cornice and a torus moulding has been crowned with another triangle which represents a pyramidion. In this context the decoration of the solar disk over water lines, the udjat-eyes and the cup are entirely fitting. These elements are also found in the top sections of other stelae. A winged disk has been added to the cavetto cornice. A border with inscription surrounds the stela's interior, which has been divided into two registers with the usual contents. Above is the veneration by the deceased of Osiris followed by the Goddess of the West, the Mistress of the Necropolis. Below is the funerary offering for Amenhotep's parents, which is brought by Amenhotep and his wife Kia, as well as a smaller representation of the ritual priest of Ptah, Pa-tir. The images and hieroglyphs have been painted in a dull yellow, symbolizing the golden light of the sun. The monument is thus also dedicated to the cult of the parents. The same situation applies to another three stelae erected by Amenhotep, usually designated with the abbreviation Huy, now in Vienna, Naples, and Rio de Janeiro."}
