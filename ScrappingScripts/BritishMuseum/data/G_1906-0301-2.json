{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1906,0301.2"], "Description": [" Hand-made terracotta figure roughly made; lower part lost. The figure is made of coarse red-brown Egyptian silty clay and has an oblong oval and flat shape. In its upper part, the potter just pinched the clay in order to model a long narrow nose and shallow eye-sockets, where eyes, separately made of round clay buttons, have been subsequently inserted before firing (the right one now missing) ; at the very bottom, short legs or feet are roughly indicated by two diverging excrescences, partly broken off. The object seems to represent a figure lying down, which might be a sort of concubine.
