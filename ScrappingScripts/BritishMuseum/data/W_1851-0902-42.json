Manufacture in his time can be excluded on stylistic grounds; a late repetition of his name, frequent in scarabs, would be pointless in sealings. b) The High Priest Men-Kheper-Ra of the 21th Dynasty has been suggested (Porter & Moss VII 397). This is unlikely on historical grounds and would create a hiatus concerning the Shabako-impressions. c) Piankhy (25th Dynasty) adopted the name Men-Kheper-Ra as prenomen: on a stela (J. von Beckerath, 'Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archaologischen Institutes in Kairo' 24 (1969) pp. 58-62) and on a fragment of a stone vase (the reading is not quite sure), see J.Leclant, 'Recherches sur les monuments th\u00e9bains de la XXVe dynastie dite \u00e9thiopienne' , p. 118 (with bibliography). On a scarab, together with his nomen; see F L Griffith, 'Oxford Excavations in Nubia: The Cemetery in Sanam' 1923, p. 113; pl. LXII 15. d) Shebitku (25th Dynasty). His more usual prenomen \u1e0fd-k\u0292(w)-r\u02bf appears alternating with mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02bf on a necklace found in a tomb of one of his horses, Dunham, 'El Kurru', p. 113; Pl. LXVIII A 2 (19-4-71). Inanother horse-tomb of the king there was found a faience cartouche with Men-kheper-Ra; see Dunham, loc.cit. (19-4-93). The later, peaceful part of the reign of either 25th Dynasty king would be possible for such relations with Assyria. The evidence seems to be better for Pianky."], "Bibliographic references": [" Giveon R 1985a / Egyptian scarabs from Western Asia from the collections of the British Museum (p.168, no.6) ", " Leichty E et al 1988a / Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, volume VIII: Tablets from Sippar 3 (p.367) ", " Hall 1913 / Catalogue of Egyptian scarabs, etc. in the British Museum (p.290, no.2775-2776) ", " Porter and Moss 1951 / Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings 7: Nubia, the Deserts, and Outside Egypt.
