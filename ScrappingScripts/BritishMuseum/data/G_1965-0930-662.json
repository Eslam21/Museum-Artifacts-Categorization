The junction of the rim and body is unclear but might find parallels with those from Schlotzhauer's South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9B. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). These cups have been found in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Hayes suggested a Rhodian origin for these types of cups but this is uncertain (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 114). Schlotzhauer points out that the same myrtle pattern is found on Fikellura style pottery from Miletus and thus suggest a South Ionian or more specifically Milesian origin for the cups (Schlotzhauer 2012, 108-9). ", " The decoration on the inside of the rim is rare, parallelled on 1924,1201.1274, which is from a different cup.
