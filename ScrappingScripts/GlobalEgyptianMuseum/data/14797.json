His hands emerge from the shroud to hold the djed pillar, the emblem of the god Osiris; the feet do not exist any more.This lapis lazuli figure of Ptah is set within a superbly decorated gold shrine with a suspension loop on the roof, so that the piece could be worn like an amulet. Each side of the shrine is decorated with a double pair of gold falcons with solar discs on their heads, standing on papyrus columns. The outer walls of the shrine are covered with a mass of reliefs representing many squatting deities in pairs, six per side, and two per row."}
