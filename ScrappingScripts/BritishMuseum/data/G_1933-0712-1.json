{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1933,0712.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta group: horseman trampling other figure. A cavalry man riding down an enemy, modelled in the round. The horse rears up with its front hooves placed upon the shoulders of a half-kneeling man, but little detail remains in this poorly made object. The long tail of the horse reaches to the rough low plinth. The rider, astride the horse, his head turned to his right, wears a chlamys and a military cap (kausia): he represents a Macedonian. The front is better modelled than the back, but that is not saying much. The right side of the horse\u2019s head is considerably damaged by the irruption of a stone left in the clay body. Probably hollow; two-piece mould. Red-brown Nile silt with a little mica, and with a largely drab buff surface. Some traces of an overall white dressing; red paint on the rider\u2019s face and his cloak, and, on the horse, probably delineating a saddle-cloth and a breastband.
