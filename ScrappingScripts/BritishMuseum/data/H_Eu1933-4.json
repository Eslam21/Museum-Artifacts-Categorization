An annotation in a later hand reads: 'The design is almost identical with Congo (upper Ubangi) type ? introduced by sugar slaves. Rouletting not found on bronze age or classical period Cyprus pottery. It is found [on] figure scenes on Rhodes vases 8th c BC and Etruscan ware - prob. derived from Sumerian cylinder seals (Forsdyke). See Ancient Egypt 1930'. Sir John Forsdyke was Keeper of the Greek & Roman Department at this date, becoming Director in 1936. The donor's name on the label should read Taylor-Purves (her mother's maiden name was Purves). She wrote on Cypriot Bronze Age pottery so was probably interested in this piece as an imitation of Bronze Age forms."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Miss J du Plat Taylor"], "Acquisition date": ["1933"], "Department": ["Britain, Europe and Prehistory"], "Registration number": ["Eu1933,-.4"], "Additional IDs": [" CDMS number: Eu1933C3.4 (old CDMS no.)
