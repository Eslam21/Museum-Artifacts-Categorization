{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 69416", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "QURNET MURA`I", "Category": "BED", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "110 cm", "Name": "Bed of Mummification", "Description": "The mummification bed is rectangular in shape. The four corners were originally decorated with heads of the Lioness Goddess Sekhmet, who was the Goddess of war. But in this case she is considered to be the protector of sleeping persons and the guard of the eastern and western gates of the Netherworld. Behind the place for the head, there is a small hole leading to a semicircular container attached to the bed but at a lower level. The purpose of this container is to collect the blood and all the bodily liquids during the process of mummification. Judging by the condition of the bed, it seems that it was used for a long time."}
