Support for the Hermopolite origin of this manuscript may also be provided by a formula used in the text. The interpretation of this text as a loan agreement rests largely upon the conjecture that a section of l. 5 is part of the standard loan agreement formula involving the phrase 'I owe you' and followed by the phrase which marks the beginning of the clause promising (re)payment. To judge from l. 10, a repayment of more than one solidus was to be made: following, a number greater than or equal to two is expected."], "Bibliographic references": [" Clackson 2000 / Coptic and Greek Texts relating to the Hermopolite Monastery of Apa Apollo (p.12, 112-3, pl.30) ", " Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (86597) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/86597) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair (incomplete - fragmentary)"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: God"], "Associated places": [" Named in inscription: Monastery of Apa Apollo "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Christie's"], "Acquisition date": ["1996"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA75315"], "Registration number": ["1996,0608.15"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: P.Mon.Apollo 44 "], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 20 Jul 2005 ", " Treatment: 23 Apr 1998 "]}
