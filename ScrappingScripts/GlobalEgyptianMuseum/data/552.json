Garstang, takes the form of a column with a curved trunk, crowned with a capital of umbellated papyrus. It has, more specifically, the form of the hieroglyph \"wadj\" which refers to the stem of the papyrus, plant and symbol of Lower Egypt, and which also signifies \"to be green\". The blue-green colour of the amulet evokes in this way the seasonal rebirth of the vegetation. The piece is surmounted by a large suspension ring."}
