This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Two other bronzes representing ichneumons were discovered in Naukratis: figure of an ichneumon walking on small base, Boston Museum of Fine Arts 86.282; hollow-cast mummy-case in the shape of an ichneumon BM 1885,1101.83. They both originate from the cache of bronzes located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42), cache made around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). Petrie does not list among the finds this group-figure with two ichneumons. Ichneumons are particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum, as well as with Horus of Letopolis (Weiss 2012, 308-309). Atum is especially well-represented at Naukratis, particularly in the category of votive box and especially in the shape of reptiles such as lizards and snakes (Masson forthcoming b).
