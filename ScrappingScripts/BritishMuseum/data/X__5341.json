This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Archaic East Greek protome of late Archaic date (broadly 550BC to 480 BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019 though numerous production places appear across East Greece. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, of Type A1 dated \u2018late Archaic\u2019, after 525BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.116, nos. 2463 and 2465). A number of fragments from the same type of protome may come from the same piece (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA452, NA761 and possibly NA831; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.8.1899; British Museum GR 2011, 5009.275). Similar protomes were found in Samos is dated to the third quarter of the 6th century BC (Tsakos 2007, 194, pl.26.2) and from Olynthus dated 6th century BC (Robinson 1952, 73-4, pl.1- 3, nos 1-2). Falls into Croissant's 'Aeolis' and 'Clazomenae' types dated between 540 and 510 BC (Croissant 1983,164 nos 82-3 and 95-107, Types F4 and G3). For context, function and details on protome parallels and fragments from Naukratis see protome records from Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA350, NA355, NA354, NA353, NA390, NA850, NA426, NA803 and NA509). A number of (mainly Cypriot) terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Blinkenberg, C. 1931.
