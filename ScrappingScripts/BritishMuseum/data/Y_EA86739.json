{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86739"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows a slightly concave area with wood impressions, probably of a knob or bolt from a box. Perpendicular to this remains of two string impressions with a width of 0.3 cm. The front is flat with rounded edges, covered in finger impressions. In the flat area a third of a seal impression is preserved, showing a seated female lion and a second sign behind it that is not further recognisable anymore. It seemed to have sealed the identical object that was closed also with EA86738 but with another seal impression on it.
