At that time, on the eve of the unification of Egypt, metal was becoming more widely used. The tomb was a simple oval cut into the surface, with the body laid at the west end, on its right side, the head to the west. The child wore the copper bangle on the left wrist, and glazed steatite beads and a carnelian pendant at the neck; behind the body was found a fish-shaped palette for grinding green eyepaint, and a white pottery vase.
