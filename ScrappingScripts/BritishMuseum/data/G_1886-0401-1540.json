A fragmentary hilt of a model sword, with a ribbed handle terminating in a stud and, on each side, the head of a panther; the swell to the guard survives on one side, the rest is broken away: from its size it is probable that only the hilt was represented, not the whole sword. Although both animal heads are modelled in the round, only the front of the hilt is ribbed, the back being largely plain. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Orange-brown Nile silt with a reddish core and abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions (<1.5mm).
