{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1908:498", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Width": "1.6 cm", "Name": "Cake of blue frit for colouring or moulding", "Description": "Cake of the artificial blue pigment, known as Egyptian blue but perhaps developed earlier in the third millennium in Syria or Mesopotamia. Until the end of the Roman Period the Egyptians and other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean peoples used this for blue, and a similar artificial composition for green. The basic ingredients for both substances were quartz sand, copper or bronze filings for the colour, and an alkaline material such as natron, the naturally-occurring sodium sesquicarbonate, added to lower the fusing temperature of the compound. The resulting substance could be used as a pigment or as a solid material for inlays or small figures."}
