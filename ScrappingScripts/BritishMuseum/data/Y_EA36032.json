{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA36032"], "Description": [" A pottery flask with flattened circular body and a short neck, flaring mouth, and two handles with small knobs at the lower spring; two small half-cylinder feet are placed at the bottom: the vessel does not stand. Both sides have the same relief decoration, but they probably stem from different moulds. The patterns lie in concentric zones, with a plain band near the edge, the outer part defined by a narrow ladder-pattern; within is a wreath-band edged with plain mouldings; this encloses a rosette with angular petals and the tips of rounded petals showing between them; at the centre is a small rosette. Pendent from the neck of the vessel is a 'necklace' with a rounded pendant. Two-piece mould. Dark-grey Nile silt with some mica, covered with a black slip: Memphis Black Ware.
