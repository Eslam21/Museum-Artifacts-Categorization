{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "116", "Dating": "25TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; ENGRAVED RELIEF; ENGRAVED", "Height": "36.9 cm", "Width": "28.9 cm", "Depth": "3.2 cm", "Name": "Stela of Ipa-wer", "Description": "The stela has a large decorated surface. At the top is a winged sun disc. The rest of the space is filled with an offering scene before Osiris. On the right is a man with an incense burner and two women on a smaller scale. Inscriptions are added above the heads of the people. Both scenes and texts give the impression of hasty work and are sometimes even clumsy. The similarity with stelae from Abydos dates this example to the second half of the 25th Dynasty."}
