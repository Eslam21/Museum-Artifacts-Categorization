{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86964"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small complete clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is showing impressions of basketry coil on the rear and side, suggesting that it was attached between the wall and lid of a basket. The top shows an impression of a scarab-like seal, with many finger prints on the right of it. The middle of the seal impression is obscured by a larger clay fragment. The impression shows a circumferential line, an ankh at the left side, and a lying gazelle or similar animal with its head bent over its back looking to the right. Above it, continuing to the right some sort of branch.
