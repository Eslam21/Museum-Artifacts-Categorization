{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "739", "Dating": "HOREMHEB/DJESERKHEPERURE-SETEPENRE ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "5.6 cm", "Name": "Naophorous statue", "Description": "The statue represents a kneeling man holding a naos with a statue of Osiris in front of him. He wears a long shirt with low-cut neck and wide pursed sleeves and an apron reaching his ankles; on the head there is an elaborate wig with wavy curls and two underlying flaps of larger curls reaching his shoulders. Delicate cold features of oval face are skilfully modelled. On the front surface of the naos there are three hieroglyphs remaining of an erased inscription (A); another inscription that was almost entirely erased had been arranged at the back pillar (B). Traces of red and yellow strips survive on the crown of Osiris. Stylistic and iconographic characteristics of the statue including the type of garment and the wig allow us to date it to post-Amarna period, probably to the reign of Horemheb."}
