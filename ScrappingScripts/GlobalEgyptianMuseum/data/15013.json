The circle of the ring is made of gold and bound with wire; the wire was probably added to improve the fit.The bezel is an almost rectangular stone plaque representing the Udjat eye of Horus, a symbol of protection of the body that ensured the wearer resurrection and rebirth. The eye was lost in a struggle and then was healed by the god of wisdom, Thoth, according to the famous myth of Osiris and Isis. The Udjat eye is pierced and attached to the ring with two round gold beads to give it flexibility and ease the movement of the stone on the finger."}
