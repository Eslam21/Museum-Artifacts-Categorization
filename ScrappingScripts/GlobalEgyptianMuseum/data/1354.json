{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7651", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "SANDSTONE; LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED", "Height": "21 cm", "Width": "24.5 cm", "Depth": "3.7 cm", "Name": "Relief of king Ay (?)", "Description": "This fragment of a private relief was probably part of a stela dating from the El-`Amarna Period: the depth of the cross is very characteristic, as are the rays of the sun ending in small hands and the deformed skull of the central figure. The scene shows a man seated on a chair and a servant (?) holding a vase in the right hand and a bowl in the left hand. It is remarkable that the person seated is dressed in the long robe of a vizier and that he wears a uraeus, a royal attribute. Could it be that it is king Ay, the successor of Tutankhamun, while still a dignitary during the reign of Akhenaten?"}
