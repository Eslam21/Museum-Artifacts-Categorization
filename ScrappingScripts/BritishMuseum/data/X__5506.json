The face is broad, the neck sturdy, the cheek bones are slightly protruding, the chin is angular. The large eyes are set up like little plates and are widely arched over by the eyebrows. The nose is large, the broad mouth with the slim lips is indicating the onset of a smile. The headscarf, which is separated from the forehead by means of a small dent, covers the upper part of the ears. The contours of the main hair broadens above the ears. On the onset of the neck traces of a necklace are visible. The back is flat though not entirely smoothed.
