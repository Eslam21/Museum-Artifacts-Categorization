Offering tables were intended to magically serve as real offerings in the tomb. They often had depictions of food inscribed on them as well as a channel for water. The table is adorned in the middle by the Sema Tawy sign, the symbol of United Egypt. The four edges of the table are engraved with an offering formula that bears the two names of Amenemhat the Second, \"Sa-Re\" and \"Nsew-Bity.\" On one of the edges we can read two offering formulas addressed to the two gods, Osiris, on the right, and Anubis, on the left. The rest of the table is occupied by two empty rectangular cavities."}
