{"artifact_name": "cornice", "Object Type": ["cornice"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.41"], "Description": [" Fragment of a marble cornice decorated with a palmette-with-scrolls above bead and reel; traces of colouring, probably from the 'second temple' of Apollo or from a monumental altar in the the Apollo sanctuary. At the front the fragment shows the rest of an even surface above which two discs and rests of two beads of an astragal remain. Above - on a lightly curved surface - lies a spiral cirrus; from it three lightly curved palmette leaves emerge. The 'core' of this palmette has been broken out; on the upper leaf, left of the contour, another broken leaf is visible. At the front some traces of paint remain; blue on the palmette, red on the spiral, bead and relief ground, and metallic blue on white ground - Pryce calls it black - on the discs. The right side of the fragment is a smoothed connecting surface which asymmetrically cuts through the bead of the astragal . The back of the fragment shows remains of anathyrosis which is set on the smooth seam of the right even short side and is otherwise characterised by a 2mm deepened and fine pointed surface. The upper surface is broken and contains the bedding for a large Pi-clamp which reached over the right connecting surface. The fragment comes from the right-hand edge of a stone block with a cyma at its upper edge, which would have continued at the left at right angles so as to form an inner corner.
