", " The goose, a sacred animal for Amun-Ra, or the duck is a regular theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88, esp. 87 for this piece). On related compositions, the lotus flower (?) can be replaced by a Maat feather (Gorton 1996, 102, type XXVIII B 24-31). Scholars tend to translate such composition by \"son of Ra\" or see a cryptographic reading of the god name Amun (Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55).
