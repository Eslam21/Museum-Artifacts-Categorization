{"artifact_name": "stove", "Object Type": ["stove"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1778"], "Description": [" Terracotta cooking stove fragment. A pot-support broken from a cooking-stove. This differs from most in that the pot-rest, which is plain, is placed high on the raised panel, well above the rim of the fire-bowl. It also has the edge of a circular aperture that opened into the bowl itself, probably below rim-level. At the back, the raised edge of the aperture is encircled by a groove made by a finger-tip; above this, rising and falling at an angle on the panel, are two parallel finger-tip grooves. The bowl was probably wheel-made, and the support and panel hand-modelled. Crude orange-red slip on outside. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a red and grey core, the inside darkened by use.
