", " Strudwick N 2006 Two almost identical wooden tablets were found in Thebes and are now in the British Museum and the Louvre. They may have come from the cache of mummies in Deir el-Bahari discovered in about 1871. They record an oracular pronouncement of Amun that a set of shabtis (servant figures) should work only for their owner, who is consequently exempt from other tasks, and that the ownership of the shabtis is indeed vested in the woman who bought them. This shows that the power of Amun could be used not just to confirm ownership, but also to control events in the next world.
