{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 37888", "Dating": "TANUTAMUN/BAKARE", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "41 cm", "Name": "Stela of Tanutamun", "Description": "The stela is from the eighth year of the Nubian King Tanutamun's reign. The upper part is decorated with an unfinished winged sun disk. The winged sun disk symbol was used to protect the contents of the stela, which records the sale of farm land. This stela captures the details of the sale, including the limits of the fields and the price paid. Because of the fragility of the sandstone from which it was made, some symbols have become illegible over time. The stela was also broken between the third and the fourth lines and later restored."}
