In the main area of the bag, lozenges and knotted netting are linked diagonally by stretched threads and leaning open areas. Below this are decorative hanging elements, of which 6 survive, consisting of a tube or an open \"flower\" with 10 pointed petals. This is a single thread structure, the yarn being S-spliced, S-twisted, 2 Z-plied linen. The edges are now ragged and were probably originally a tubular object. Openwork.
