The feet sheath was made from a single piece. It imitated sandals, composed simply of a sole, a heel and a strap, to which a knot was attached. The feet, the toes and the ankles were indicated by some simple traits. This beautiful example from Brussels is also distinguished by a vertical line of small blue and red rectangles, which separates the feet. A similar geometric decoration served to mark the thickness of the sole. On the bottom,  two distinct soles are drawn, decorated by a linear motif."}
