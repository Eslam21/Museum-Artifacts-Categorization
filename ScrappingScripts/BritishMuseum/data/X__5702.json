", " The bulk of calcite vessels discovered in Naukratis are alabastra such as this one. Evidence for a local production of calcite vessels is given by the discovery of \u201cmany thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u201d as well as unfinished vessels in the same material found in the temenos of Apollo in 1885, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). Most of these vessels should be dated to the second half of the 6th or latest first half of the 5th century BC. Alabastra vessels already appear in the late 25th dynasty (examples of the 7th century from the royal cemeteries at el-Kurru and Nuri in Sudan: Dunham 1950, 31, fig. 11c, j and pl. XXXIX; Dunham 1955, 13, fig. 3). However, they start to be really popular in the 26th dynasty and are still produced in the Roman Period (Petrie 1937, 14; Aston 1994, 166; Masson 2007, 612, pl. XXVIII no. 1-3; Masson forthcoming). The shape of this specimen is more typical of the Late Period, especially of 26th-27th dynasty. It is one of the three alabastra that Hogarth collected from his excavation in the area of the Great Temenos. The other two are Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4556 and AN1896-1908-E.4557).
