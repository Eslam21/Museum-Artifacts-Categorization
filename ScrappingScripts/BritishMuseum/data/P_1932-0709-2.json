The fragments come from the version of Pirckheimer's Latin translation of the Greek manuscript by Philippus, discovered by a Florentine priest, Cristoforo de' Buondelmenti on the island of Andros, of the \u2018Hieroglyphica\u2019 of Horapollo Niliacus, an Alexandrian of the fourth or fifth centuries AD (J\u00fcrgen Osing, \u2018Lexicon der \u00c4gyptologie\u2019, ii, Wiesbaden, 1978, col. 1275). This work claimed to expose the hidden meaning of the sacred symbols of ancient Egypt. Although its interpretation of hieroglyphics is mistaken ( essentially they are rebuses intended to preserve religious thought from the uninitiated) the translation of \u2018Hieroglyphica\u2019 had a profound effect on the evolution of Renaissance humanism. Through its example the humanists were prompted to search for equivalents of these ancient 'symbols', and thus arose the fascination with emblems that was to permeate intellectual life in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thausing perceived that the drawings of four symbols in the Blasius collection and now on deposit in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg (Zink, pp. 83-86, nos. 60-63, repr.) were cut from a manuscript written by Pirckheimer, which he thought was some astrological work, with illustrations of the stars (Thausing, ii, p. 216). Its true nature was made known when Giehlow published the fair copy of the manuscript, now in the Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, Cod. 3255 (\u2018Vienna Jahrbuch\u2019, xxxii, 1915, pp. 1-229). It is not certain, however, whether the first version written in Pirckheimer's lively hand with D\u00fcrer's sketches was the copy given to the Emperor, or the neatly written version, now in Vienna. As Flechsig and Winkler have already suggested, the likelihood is in favour of Codex 3255, being the presentation copy; indeed, Winkler was latterly inclined to consider the illustrations in the Viennese manuscript to be by D\u00fcrer himself. The present fragment, discovered and published by Dodgson, shows the first symbols in the manuscript, \u2018The sun, the moon, and basilisk\u2019, representing \u2018Eternity\u2019 (Boas, \u2018Horapollo\u2019, p. 57, no. 1; cf. Giehlow, op. cit., pp. 173-4, fol. 2 verso, 3 recto; for a discussion on Horapollo and the Egyptian conceptions of Eternity, see Erik Iversen, \u2018Rivista degli Studi Orientali\u2019, xxxviii, Rome, 1963, pp. 177ff).
