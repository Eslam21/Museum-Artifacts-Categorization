The iconography and decoration are similar to other sarcophagi of this period, although this specimen is inferior in terms of the technique of the figures and the style of the inscriptions, all rendered more crudely. The sarcophagus and outer lid are completely covered by winged divinities, scarabs with solar discs and inscriptions. The sarcophagus itself is divided up into panels showing the funerary gods, scenes related to the resurrection of the deceased, etc. The inner lid, which would have been in direct contact with the mummy, is decorated with drawings copying the faience beads of meshwork funerary shawls."}
