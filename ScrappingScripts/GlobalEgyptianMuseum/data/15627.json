It has a curved top with a square abacus above a short shaft and a base. An abacus is a slab on the top of a capital of a column. On each side of the surface of the curved portion and on its back, open hands were drawn in brown. This is a reference to the magical function of the headrest, as proclaimed in the spells of the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, \"May your head be awake when you are asleep. May your head be awake at the horizon. Raise yourself, [for] you have overthrown your enemies.\""}
