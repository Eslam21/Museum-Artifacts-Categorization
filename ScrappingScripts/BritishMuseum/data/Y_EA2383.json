{"artifact_name": "sculpture", "Object Type": ["sculpture"], "Museum number": ["EA2383"], "Description": [" Limestone bust of a female figure, partially damaged. She wears a large and heavy wig with detailed individual tresses of the hair and tighter braids of hair forming a pattern around the ends. Traces of black paint are still notable across the wig, while the top of the head also features a band or diadem decorated with a pattern of vertical lines. There are traces of red paint at the top of the head, possibly originally part of decoration from the top of the headband. Her eyes are heavily incised around the edges, with thick arched eyebrows and a slight depression conveying the brow bone. Her nose is now damaged at the tip, and her thick lips are pursed together. The bottom lip is sharply incised, and the outer corners of the mouth appear to be flat. There are faint traces of black paint within her eyes. The edges of the wig closest to the face are broken off from the chin level, and there are further visible chips to her mouth and chin. "], "Cultures/periods": [" New Kingdom ", " 18th Dynasty (?
