The division between head and prothorax is shown by two lateral short grooves. No further details shown at the back, few cracks of the material. The shape of the head is trapezoidal, no further details shown. The side of the scarab shows two legs on each side, on top of the base plate. The seal at the base shows traces at the right of an oval line framing the base. At the top a sun disc, left and right of it two not parallel lines (stylized wings?). Underneath two falcons facing to the right, the lines above might be a flagellum as well, at least of the falcon on the left side. Underneath a nb-basket. The orientation of the seal is longitudinal as is the perforation of the object.
