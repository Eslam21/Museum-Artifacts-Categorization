Her jewellery consists of serpent bracelets and a necklace with a medallion as a pendant. The folds of her upper and lower garments are rendered schematically. The curls of the wig are arranged in rows, and two braids appear from behind the ears and fall almost down to waist-level. The relief is very stylized which also affects the face with its oversized eyes and diminutive mouth."}
