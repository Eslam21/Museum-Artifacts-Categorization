The composition appears to be based on a painting by Rubens (Rooses 183) which was engraved by Schelte A. Bolswert (Hollstein 183; R,5.51). There is also an engraving by Cornelis Galle (II) which is closer to this, in that St Joseph carries a staff and bundle over his shoulder, rather than leaning on his staff (see 1891,0414.594)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Chaloner Smith 1883 / British Mezzotinto portraits from the introduction of the art to the early part of the present century (undescribed)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["holy family"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Jesus Christ ", " Representation of: Virgin Mary ", " Representation of: St Joseph "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: John Hardy"], "Acquisition date": ["1876"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1876,1111.57"]}
