They were discovered in AD 1907 in the mysterious and unfinished Tomb Number 55 in the Valley of the Kings. The unidentified tomb held grave goods and a sarcophagus containing a mummy, which were stylistically typical of the Amarna period. The sarcophagus was made for a woman, but was used to hold the body of a king, probably Smenkhkare. He was the co-regent of Akhenaten who died young and was buried at Thebes. The canopic jars used to store the embalmed internal organs were originally made for a queen, probably Meritaten, the eldest daughter of Akhenaten who married Smenkhkare. The facial features on the lids of the canopic jars are claimed by some to be those of Meritaten and by others to be those of Kiya, the second wife of Akhenaten."}
