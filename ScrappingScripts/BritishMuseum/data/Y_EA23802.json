{"artifact_name": "game-board; platter", "Object Type": [" game-board ", " platter "], "Museum number": ["EA23802"], "Description": [" Fragments of a rectangular game-board made of coarse red siltware pottery. The fragments have been joined to form two larger pieces, one consisting of six fragments and the other of three. Parts of the original edges of the object are preserved, showing either a slight curve or a straight cut. The irregular lower surface shows circular traces confirming that the gaming-board has been made from an original round platter made on a potter's wheel, cut on two long sides before the firing. The upper surface of the board was scored with a grid pattern of originally 10 x 3 squares, a maximum of 21 being now preserved, both items together. The grooves between the squares were cut post-firing and have cut through the pale cream surface slip. This slip is also present on the plain underside. A small area of the larger piece has been made up in modern material. The two pieces are not be connected but their relative position can be infered almost exactly from the scratched lines on the upper surface and the circular traces on the lower surface. Number and distribution of squares suggest that the object is a board for egyptian senet-game.
