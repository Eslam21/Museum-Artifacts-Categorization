The number '103' is written in pencil on the inner surface. The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic details and the absence of decoration on the exterior surface make it impossible to determine whether it comes from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior; given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1457) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.20"]}
