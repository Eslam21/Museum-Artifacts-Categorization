Her pubic area is delineated with black paint, and her elongated arms are held by her sides. On her left side at the portico\u2019s wall appears to be an image of a mirror and handle outlined in black paint, with the upper part of the mirror now faded. There are also traces of a blue paint on this part of the portico. On either side of the figure are two Hathor-headed capitals, again with black paint used to detail their wigs. The faces of both of these Hathor heads are also worn, and no features can be discerned. The sides and reverse of the plaque are blank. The edges of the portico and the figure\u2019s legs are damaged. The object is now supported on a modern base.
