{"artifact_name": "scribal palette", "Object Type": ["scribal palette"], "Museum number": ["EA5512"], "Description": [" Wooden scribal palette of Meryra: this example is unusual, but by no means unique, in having more than two ink pans. One would expect that the fourteen hollows here held different colours. This palette, however, has traces only of black and red around the four lowest wells on the right side and in the pen slot, where the predominance of black at the top and red at the bottom suggests that two ends of a single pen were used for the two colours and that pens were replaced in the slot with the more frequently used black tip toward the top. Thutmose IV's name appears in a cartouche at the top of palette. Along the sides, with his name and title, are funerary prayers addressed to the dynastic god Amun and toThoth, the god of writing and patron of scribes. These were inscribed, as the bottom line tells us, by Meryra's own scribe. The palette is apparently from Saqqara.
