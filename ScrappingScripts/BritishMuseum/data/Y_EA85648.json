{"artifact_name": "sealing", "Object Type": ["sealing"], "Museum number": ["EA85648"], "Description": [" Irregular bulla made of a fine brown Nile clay in the shape of a ball. The object is very roughly formed and finished, the surface is irregular as well as very eroded and partly chipped off, there are white accretions as well as black discolouration on the surface. There are five possibly six seal impressions of an oval scarab-like seal with a very flat cut motif that is almost unrecognisable anymore. One of the impressions shows a circumferential line with two signs, a straight thick line as well as a sign that consists of two perpendicular bands meeting in a right angle (L-shape). The seal has the size of about 1.2 x 1.0 cm. After excavation a glossy translucent substance was added for consolidation.
