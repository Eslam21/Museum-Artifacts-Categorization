{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.4"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of a monkey playing the harp. A monkey squatting on a cushioned footstool (forming the plinth), his head turned to his right, his tail curving under him, playing a triangular harp which rests on his knees. The harp has a divided knobbed top and is slightly injured. The animal may be wearing a hooded cloak, but this is uncertain. The back, which has considerable surface damage, shows a certain amount of modelling, including the rear of the harp and the monkey\u2019s left arm and hand plucking the strings. What may be striations of drapery are indicated behind the head. There is a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a buff surface in places, and some white grits. The front has traces of a white dressing, and yellow paint adorns the upright and top of the harp.
