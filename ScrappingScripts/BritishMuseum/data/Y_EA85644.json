{"artifact_name": "artefact", "Object Type": ["artefact"], "Museum number": ["EA85644"], "Description": [" Clay artefact shaped of brown fine clay with inclusions of mica and few voids from organics. The object is bag-shaped with a circular lower body and a stout neck. A small hole appears in the top with a width of 0.25-0.35 cm and a depth of 1.8 cm. The object is roughly shaped and finished, and shows finger impressions from shaping it. The function is not clear as it is to small for a container like AW386, and is not flat at the \"bottom\". Attachment of another clay object or a stick? The object card shows that originally two objects of this kind have been found. The location of 413B is unknown but this object was more drop-shaped and also had a hole.
