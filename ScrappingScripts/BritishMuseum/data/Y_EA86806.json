The rear shows a convex impression like from a vessel or similar object, in the break two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.35 cm. The front side is slightly concave and covered by finger impressions. In the upper part two impressions, from both only the upper half is preserved. They originate from the same seal and show two standing figures. The left figure is facing towards the right, seems to be a stylized falcon headed god with a sun-disc above the head, the figure on the right is Amun, wearing the double feather crown, facing to the left and holding a wAs-sceptre in front of him. The rest is broken off. Black accretions on the surface. Same motif as EA86808.
