{"artifact_name": "stool", "Object Type": ["stool"], "Museum number": ["EA2476"], "Description": [" Wooden stool with lattice bracing, gessoed and painted white. The double-cove seat is formed of curved strips of wood with four slats in the centre. The wood was either steamed and bent or cut to shape. The surface has been gessoed and painted white. Lattice bracing fills the voids between the four legs of the stool. The sides alternate in the use of one and two vertical struts, one for the shorter sides and two for the longer. A feature common in latticework stools is the slightly higher stretchers on the shorter sides, which preserves the strength of the wood by separating pairs of mortise-and-tenon joints.
