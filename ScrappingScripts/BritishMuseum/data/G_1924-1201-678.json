Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two white bands (Williams 1983, 169)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (pl. 21.22) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1489) (phase 2) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.678"]}
