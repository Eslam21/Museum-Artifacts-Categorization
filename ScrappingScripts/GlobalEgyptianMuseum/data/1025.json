{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6350", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "ANIMAL/HYBRID FIGURINE", "Material": "CALCITE/ALABASTER", "Technique": "HEWN; PAINTED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "7 cm", "Width": "4.5 cm", "Name": "Figurine of a hippopotamus", "Description": "This figurine in alabaster, which was acquired in the art trade, but of which the provenance is not known, represents a hippopotamus on a socle. The work is very basic: the different details of the head and of the body of the animal are difficult to distinguish. It is probably a figurine which remained unfinished; the fact that the muzzle of the hippopotamus and the socle still form a whole is a revealing element. The piece dates from the Middle Kingdom."}
