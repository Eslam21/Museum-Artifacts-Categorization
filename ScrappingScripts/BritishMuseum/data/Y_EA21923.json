{"artifact_name": "stamp", "Object Type": ["stamp"], "Museum number": ["EA21923"], "Description": [" A circular terracotta bread-stamp, with a smoothed rounded back and no grip: there is a possibility that this is a jar-stopper, particularly as the design is not incuse. It has a relief pattern: within randomly placed pointed-oval buds and studs, a horse or mule moves to right in the impression. Pressed over a modelled form. Orange-brown Nile silt, with white inclusions and some mica. The surface at the back is flaking away in places. Face varnished in modern times for an impression to be taken and released.
