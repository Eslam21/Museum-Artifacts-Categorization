This fan stock is ebony veneered with decorative motifs made of tree bark. Its top is shaped like a papyrus umbel, or petal cluster, with its calyces, or outer leaves, and stem. At the lower end, a knob in the form of an inverted papyrus umbel, or petal cluster, of the lotus is found.

The stock at the top into which the quills were inserted show that it once held 48 feathers. The palm of the fan contains the cartouche of the King, \"Neb Kheperu Ra.\""}
