The information is taken from the original accession card.The stela is round-topped, in the arch are two recumbent jackals facing each other. Directly beneath them are two horizontal lines of inscription, a htp-dj-nsw formula reading from left to right. The lower register shows a man, presumably the deceased whose name is unfortunately lost, seated on a chair before a table of offerings. He holds a lotus flower in his left hand and extends his right towards the offerings. On the right is a kneeling woman and a standing man who wears a short kilt with a projecting panel. Above these figures are small inscriptions, names and titles, now mostly lost."}
