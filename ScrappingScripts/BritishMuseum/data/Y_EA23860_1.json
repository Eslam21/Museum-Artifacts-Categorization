The ancient Egyptians used ground galena (lead sulphide) as an eye cosmetic, mixed with water to form a paste, also known as kohl. Both men and women wore eye paint for its aesthetic and protective qualities. Galena replaced malachite, a green copper carbonate mineral, which was used as an eye paint until the middle of the Old Kingdom (Ashton et el 2000, 44). Galena was sourced from a number of sites, including Gebel Rosas, south of Quseir on the Read Sea coast, and sites throughout the Eastern Desert, such as Um Gheig and Samiuki (Ogden 2000, 168; Hassan and Hassan 1981).
