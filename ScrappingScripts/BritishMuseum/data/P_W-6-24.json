Although the initials HS are inscribed in pencil at center, the sheet presents in the lower left corner Philipe's blindstamp with no intials (probably washed out) and the 1870s BM Cracherode Collection stamp. Given the quality of the impression and the conditions of the sheet, characteristic more of Cracherode's collection than of Sloane's, precedence has been given to the evidence of a Cracherode provenance."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["W,6.24"], "Conservation": ["Wash, buffer and repair: 08 Jun 1981"]}
