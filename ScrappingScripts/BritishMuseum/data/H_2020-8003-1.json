The vessel is then blown from this mixture and the charactertistic colour streaks become more pronounced as the glass curves during the process. The technique was first used in Egypt in the Roman period, rediscovered in Murano in the 15th centry, lost again, and revived in the 19th century."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Judy Rudoe"], "Acquisition date": ["2020"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased by J.
