Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is either a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun / Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) or an abbreviated form for the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 165). This scaraboid belongs to a type, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B58-61, see especially B58 for this piece). The hieroglyphs depicted on the underside can be found on several scarabs and scaraboids of various shapes discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl.
