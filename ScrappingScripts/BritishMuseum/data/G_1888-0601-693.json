Further pieces of wall plaster, painted red and blue on a white ground, possibly with some yellow, were found in the temple by Gardner during the second season of work at Naukratis; designs were identified as consisting of a maeaender alternating with stars within squares. Analysis of the pieces by Prof. Middleton showed the red to be pure iron oxide and the blue to be made of \"powdered glass coloured with some salt of copper and then mixed with lime\"; the very fine plaster was found to be \"made of about 3 parts of lime to 1 of finely-ground silica or quarz\" (Gardner 1888, 31, with note 3)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (AC.12)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.693"]}
