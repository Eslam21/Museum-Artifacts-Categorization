", " Square and parallelepiped weights are commonly found in Egypt and appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII). They were manufactured in a large range of material: they were more often made of all sorts of hard stones, especially white limestone, alabaster but also various colourful stone such as marble, serpentine, porphyry (etc.); in Naukratis, such shapes occur also regularly in basalt, diorite, granite and sandstone, like this specimen; bronze and lead examples are at last quite numerous (Cour-Marty 1990, 26-27, fig. 9-10, fig. 13). It is difficult to associate a specific standard with this specimen. Weights around 53-54 g are relatively rare in Naukratis and Egypt in general (Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 19; Cour-Marty 1991, 145). According to the Oriental Institute Museum database, this weight corresponds to 4 shekels. However, since in Naukratis, square and parallelepiped weights seems particularly associated to the Persian silver siglos (around 5.3 and 5.6 g) (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII), it could be the equivalent of 10 sigli. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989. Les poids dans l\u2019\u00c9gypte ancienne, Vols. 1-3 [unpublished thesis, microform], Paris.
