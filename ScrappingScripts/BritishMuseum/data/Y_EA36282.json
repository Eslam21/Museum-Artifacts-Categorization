The Newark vase is of dark-blue glass with a single register of feather pattern, also in white and yellow, covering most of the body. It has the convex base and roughly cylindrical body of the British Museum example, unlike the usual Egyptian pomegranate vase which has a globular body. Additional evidence for the dating and provenance of the type exists, in a fragment catalogue under 1943,0410.1. The preservation is very incomplete and assembled from fragments. Most of the body and all of the top area of the vessel are lost. Possibly the small remaining top area of the body has been ground down.
