The numbers 76, 734 and 1 are written in pencil on the exterior surface of the sherd. The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic elements and the absence of decoration on the interior and exterior surfaces make it impossible to determine whether it came from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (pl.
