{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1897,1026.1"], "Description": [" Painted plaster figure of Aphrodite Anadyomene. A plaster figure of Aphrodite Anadyomene standing, modelled in the round and surviving from the neck to below the knees, the raised arms largely lost. Her drapery falls from below the pubic area and the buttocks, with a roll of the cloth encircling the figure and tied in a large knot at the front, the ends falling to at least knee level. The figure has been cast round a small oval spill of wood, a broken end showing at the break in the legs. White plaster, with painted areas: the torso was a buff colour, which only survives well at the rear; the drapery round the legs is greenish blue; but the roll round the thighs is coloured a deep pink with black detailing, as also is the knotted fall; the pubic hair is ginger-blond. Part of the break below the knees is covered with a pitch-like substance, presumably acquired after the figure was discarded. The object appears to be mould-made, but no casting webs can be seen.
