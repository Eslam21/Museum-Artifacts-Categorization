Napoleon's face with upturned eyes. Heavy shackles inscribed 'Gallic Liberty' hang from mask and serpents. The centre-piece of the crown, standing on the circlet, is a bottle of 'Poison from Egypt'. From this (l. and r.) two swords both inscribed 'Instrument of Persuasion', slant across (l.) a jewelled turban: 'A Mahometan Turbin' [sic] and (r.)
