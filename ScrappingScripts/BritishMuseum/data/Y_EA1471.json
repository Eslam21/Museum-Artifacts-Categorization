{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1471"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Mahuia: a small, round-topped stela originally incised on its face with forty-four ears divided into six rows on each side of the stela, the top and bottom of which was comprised of three ears and the rest four ears. A column of text down the centre contains a prayer to Ptah, while a line of text at the bottom names the dedicator Mahuia. The stela has lost its upper right-hand corner and its lower left-hand one, both of which have been restored in modern times. The surface is covered with small scratches and some black stains. There are faint traces of red paint in some of the ears.
