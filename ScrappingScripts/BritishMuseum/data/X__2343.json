This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The motif shows the pharaoh symbolised by the falcon god Horus, protected by two uraei (on this symbolic: Magnarini 2004, 234). The design, the shape of the cobras as well as the fine cross-hatching inside the signs are highly reminiscent of the Hyksos period (see examples from good contexts at Meggido, Jericho, Fara and Ajjul: Tufnell 1984, 132-133, class 9C3b, pl. XXXVII; for various Hyksos parallels, see the references given in: Magnarini 2004, 234, 09.28). A comparable treatment of the back is found on other scarabs from Naukratis that can be dated to the Second Intermediate Period: BM 1888,0601.65; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.3; Birmingham City Museum & Art Gallery 1888A195.1. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
