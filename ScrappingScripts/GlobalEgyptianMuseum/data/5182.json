Her own smooth hair reaches from under the wig until well down on the forehead.The left shoulder-strap of the garment is preserved in white paint. On the left upper arm are five red-brown fingers in low relief of the hand of a man situated to the right of the woman.Judging from the shape of the wig and the three lappets hanging from the back of the head, this little piece should be dated to the middle of the 18th Dynasty."}
