", " According to Lemos, the female figure is a representation of Athena but there are no features depicted that are specific to her. Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Group of Worshippers within the Chalice Style. The leading vase from this group is the St. Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which has the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Chalice Style; the figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are hallmarks of the other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Chalice Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black-figure.
