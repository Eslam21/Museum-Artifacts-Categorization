", " Papyriform staffs are usually surmounted by the figure of an animal (see for example: Weiss 2012, Pl. 41e-f, 42a, 43b, 71c). Naukratis provided a few fragmentary papyriform staffs, as well as a finial for staff, with either figures of a raised cobra or a ram's head. The upper surface of this capital does not seem to have been topped by a figure. It could also be an amulet representing a simple wadj papyrus-column. Such amulets are common in Naukratis, but they are made off glazed composition.
