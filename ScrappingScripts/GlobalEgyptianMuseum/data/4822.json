{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "27b", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GREYWACKE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "21.2 cm", "Width": "13.3 cm", "Depth": "8.9 cm", "Name": "Fragmentary bust of a male statue", "Description": "The head and upper body of a male statue, preserved down to the waist. The left side is broken off obliquely from the ear to the right side of the body. The right arm is missing from the armpit. Because there is no back pillar and the upper arms are held slightly forwards, as indicated by the remains of the right arm, this must have been a seated statue with the hands resting on the upper legs. The broad flat face and the eyes have parallels with the art of the Middle Kingdom, especially those manufactured during the reign of Senwosret II."}
