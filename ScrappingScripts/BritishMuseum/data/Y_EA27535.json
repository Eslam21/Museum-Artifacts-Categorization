This amulet represents more likely Amun-Ra, since the ram-headed god Amun-Ra Baded was the main deity revered in Naukratis (Guermeur 2005, 126-138; Yoyotte 1982/83). Furthermore, Khnum is usually recognisable by his long horizontal spiralled horns (Germond 2005, 28). However, according to Andrews, identification of deities which have the ram as a totemic animal is not easy (Andrews 1994, 30-31; various examples of amulets representing a ram-headed god: Herrmann et al. 2010, 37-38).
