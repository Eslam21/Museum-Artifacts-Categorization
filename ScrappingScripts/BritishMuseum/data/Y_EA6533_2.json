{"artifact_name": "textile; cloth", "Object Type": [" textile ", " cloth "], "Museum number": ["EA6533"], "Description": [" Small textile fragment; undyed linen cloth; plain selvedge at one side. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby], patterned with darker threads in the warp, mainly arranged in pairs - these threads are probably also undyed, but naturally darker. The threads are S-spun and S-spliced; the stitch gauge is warp c.29 ends per 10mm and weft 15 picks per 10mm. No sewing is present, but wear along the selvedge suggests that there may have been sewing along this area. "], "Cultures/periods": [" New Kingdom (?) ", " Third Intermediate (?)
