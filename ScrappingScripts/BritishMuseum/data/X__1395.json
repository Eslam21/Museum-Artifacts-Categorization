", " Close parallels from Naukratis in style, but without the Greek-style veil (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA600; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.77). This is slightly unusual for Egypt, as it appears to have some Greek influence in the style of dress, like other examples from Naukratis (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.78; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA368). These figures are usually depicted naked, apart from head-gear or a wig, as representations of Isis-Hathor. However a small number of female figure plaques made at Naukratis were of clothed women and apparently represent devotees or Greek deities (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA329). Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Parallels are generally dated to the Late Period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt. Thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.109, nos 203-9, particularly no. 206 from Memphis; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, pl. 50.1-5, nos. 263-7, particularly no. 266; Weber 1914, no.199; Petrie 1909, pl.35.11; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69,3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos. 1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and the Temple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Armana (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888, 0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, (SCA), (unpublished).
