{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 63799", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-MEDINAH", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; DRAWING", "Height": "13.5 cm", "Name": "Ostracon of a Monkey", "Description": "This ostracon has an amusing drawing in red and black of a monkey standing on its hind legs and eating from a mound of grain gathered next to a building, probably a storehouse. Above the monkey, a hieroglyphic script written from left to right reads, \"The Scribe of the Granary.\" This title suggests that the artist intended to use the animal character in what would normally be a human occupation to criticize human nature in an amusing manner. Cross-hatching has been used to suggest the texture of the monkey's fur."}
