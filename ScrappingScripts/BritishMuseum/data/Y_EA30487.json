The whole of each side including the pedestal was made in one piece with a punch in a shaped mould - the join is visible down the centre of the nose and the middle of the back. The back of the pedestal on which the sphinx sits is rounded. A base-plate, slightly turned up at the edges, was added to the bottom. Under the chin of the sphinx is a cylindrical tube, slightly corrugated, representing the beard; this in turn rests on another tube, set at right-angles, providing the passage for the stringing and protecting the figure itself from being rubbed by the thread or wire, as did a collar of gold wire at the back of the sphinx where the thread or wire emerged. The sphinx has a human head and lion's bodies. On its heads it wears the 'nemes' headdress with a uraeus made from wire curving across the top of the head in four loops. The sphinx's tails ismade from wire and arranged around the right haunch; it is thickened into a knob at the end. Signs of solder under the uraeus and joining the tail to the body are visible.
