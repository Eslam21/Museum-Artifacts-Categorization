The kneeling figure is exceptionally well modeled, depicting the man with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest, prominent collarbones, and sturdy arms. His lower legs are bent under his thighs and he holds on his lap, with exceptionally long hands, a seated depiction of Osiris in full regalia. The feathered white Atef crown is on the deity's head; his hands grasp a crook and a flail. The god is seated on a low chair. A wide dorsal, or back, pillar bears two framed columns of writing. On each side of the pillar there is a single unframed column of inscription containing prayers to the deity and the name and titles of the owner. The statue stands on a thick, rectangular base encircled by two rows of hieroglyphs. The top of the base, in front of the kneeling figure's knees, contains an additional two rows of text. The back of the flat-crowned, deeply striated, or striped, extremely wide wig, rests on top of the back pillar and reaches almost to the edges of the subject's shoulders. The square-shaped face is deeply modeled and realistic with a somewhat grim expression."}
