", " A few amulets in similar material were found in Naukratis, all representing Egyptian gods. They share details in the manufacture and style: Montreal, Redpath Museum 2507; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.86.326 (also figure of Nefertum), 86.184 and 86.188; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1888.173; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2267. It is plausible that they were produced locally. Nefertum is a deity particularly revered in the Memphite region, as the son in the Memphite sacred triad, and at Bubastis through his close association with Bastet/Sekhmet (Weiss 2012, 106). His cult was however relatively popular in the whole Delta region. Nefertum is relatively well represented in small amuletic figures from Naukratis, may they be in copper alloy, glazed composition or stone like for this specimen (Masson forthcoming). During the Late Period, Nefertum\u2019s role widened to \u2018bearer of good fortune\u2019 explaining his popularity as an amuletic figure (Heinz 2011, 217).
