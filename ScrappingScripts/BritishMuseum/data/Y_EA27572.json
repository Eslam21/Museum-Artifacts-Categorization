Combined with the overal shape of the seal, it is likely not earlier than the Late Period but examples are still attested into the Late Roman period in Egypt (Teeter 2003, 197, pl. 106a, no. 320, with various parallels). The possibility that it is an imported seal should also be considered with grey limestone (if the identification of the material is correct) pointing towards a possible Cypriot origin.
