{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "79", "Dating": "PTOLEMY I SOTER I (not before); PTOLEMY III EUERGETES I (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA ?", "Category": "COLOSSUS", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED; SCULPTURED; INLAY", "Height": "57 cm", "Width": "60 cm", "Depth": "48 cm", "Name": "Colossal head of royal statue", "Description": "The head, with the royal head-dress or Nemes, comes from a colossal royal statue. The break occurs at the neck. The face has rounded cheeks and a very strong protruding chin. The eyes are set close together and were inlaid but the inlay is now gone. The fact that the tail of the head-dress is vertical suggests this head comes from a standing figure. The head is similar to the Vienna head no. 80. Both come from over life-sized statues that should probably be dated to the early Ptolemaic Period."}
