The painting differs from this study in a number of respects, most notably in the reduction of the scale of the figures in the upper register which has the effect of pushing them backwards. Popham published this drawing as the work of the Paduan painter Stefano dell'Arzere (1515-1564), the correct attribution is due to Kurz. Lit.: A.E.
