In this drawing St Antony is kneeling on the far left of the composition, his head turned back towards the menacing group of seven nudes (some male, some female). The figures are not very detailed and it seems that here Domenico is more interested in getting a general sense of movement of the group towards the left hand side of the picture plane, hovering on the saint who seems to be about to run away on his knees. The construction of the composition is closer to those drawings in this series that represent the saint on the left while being tormented by beasts, as in nos. 1907-7-17-64 to72. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
