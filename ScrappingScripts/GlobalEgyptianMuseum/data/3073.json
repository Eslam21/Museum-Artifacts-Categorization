{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "16.4.1861.1", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC; LINEN", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED", "Name": "Mummy", "Description": "This mummy can only realistically be described as a jumble of bones. The head is lying free and the ribs, spinal column and pelvis are in a state of utter confusion, many teeth lie scattered among the disorganised bones. There is evidence that the arms had been placed in the extended position. The outer wrapping of the mummy is still in place but is both damaged and discoloured. There are no soft tissue remnants visible but the skeleton appears to be the remains of a slightly built, elderly female."}
