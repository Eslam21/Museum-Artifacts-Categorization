", " \u2018Corn\u2019 or \u2018palm\u2019 lamps, are contemporary and related to (and often conflated with, or a considered a subtype of) \u2018frog lamps\u2019, previously thought to all date to the 3rd or 4th centuries AD (Bailey 1988, nos Q2152, Q2153, Q2188 to Q2190). Though other forms have recently been found in 2nd century AD deposits this seems to be a later form. Bailey warns that late 2nd or early 3rd century AD \u2018frog lamps\u2019 from Myos Hormos (Whitcomb & Johnson 1982, pl. 60dd) and from el-Ashmunein (Bailey 1998, pl. 87 X13), suggest these have also been made before the 3rd century AD. Other (earlier variant) examples were also found at Naukratis (British Museum PE 1886,0401.1358 OA4343; Bolton 1886.31.10). 3rd to 4th century AD parallel from Tell Atrib (M\u0142ynarczyk 2012, type TA III.3).
