", " Close early 5th century BC parallels from Rhodes, Aeolis and Samos (Higgins 1970, 145, 562, 525). Of late Archaic type, dating from the end of the 6th and beginning of the 5th century BC. Close to East Greek types, but made of a local Nile silt fabric. Like other local Naukratis copies of East Greek protomes, this example is much thicker, and the detail is less well defined, as if it is from a worn, or poorly copied, mould series. A small number of East Greek style protomes of Classical Greek date appear to have been made locally at Naukratis and placed in the Hellenion (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4657, AN1896-1908- G.79; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA823, NA820, NA766, NA464, NA317). However, these Egyptian copies were largely dated later than this example (of mid to late 5th century BC date, Gutch 1898-9, 78-9, numbers 12 and 13, pl. X.13, Cairo, Egyptian Museum JE34156; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.85). The majority of protomes from Naukratis were imported from East Greece and of types typically found on Rhodes.
