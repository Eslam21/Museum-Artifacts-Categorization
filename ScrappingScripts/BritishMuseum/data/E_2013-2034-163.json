All figures are upright and facing left except the human figure which is face on and the dog which faces right. The human figure is at the bottom left with a short torso and limbs and a long neck with no apparent head. The sheep figures are mostly collected on the left of the image, all with raised tails. The four rightmost sheep have vertical grooves emanating from the throat (beards?). On the left is a dog with legs outstretched as if running, towards the sheep (hunting?). There are two further dog figures are on the upper right, pictured as if standing, above an unidentified quadruped. At the top right are two unidentified, pecked shapes cut off the edge of the image, the leftmost is a long zigzag snaking down towards the sheep. In the middle of the image are seven large, vertical, deep, polished grooves, tapering with pointed ends, some of which are superimposed by pecking. All the figures have been subject to varying degrees of rubbing to smooth the pecked infill. Random, interspersed pecking marks cover the entire tableau. A 5cm photo scale has been fitted at the base of the image. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.

This engraving site is on a boulder with a smooth vertical face on the ancient river terrace. Wadi Hamra is a canyon-like valley with a relatively flat floor between one and 200m wide, curling more or less south into the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert. There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " mammal ", " hunting/shooting ", " dog "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi Hamra "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.163"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWHA0020009 (TARA number) "]}
