{"artifact_name": "amulet(?); figure", "Object Type": [" amulet (?) ", " figure "], "Museum number": ["EA68828"], "Description": [" Fragmentary amuletic (?) figure of a falcon or ba-bird, the head, lower legs and base now lost. The wings of the falcon figure are elaborately decorated with crosshatching on either side of the chest, two sets of incised rows of parallel lines denoting the feathers of the wings, and parallel overlapping double rows of dots indicating the coverts and tail of the falcon. Above the legs of the figure the chest projects outwards, suggesting the bird\u2019s feathers. On either side of the figure at the crosshatched area of the wings are two visible clean breaks, which originally would have depicted extended human arms reaching towards the front of the figure. Glaze applied to the figure in antiquity is now lost, but there are traces of a faint green colour across the bird\u2019s body. In addition to the breaks detailed above, there are several chips to the bird\u2019s body on both sides of the legs, and across the reverse of the bird\u2019s wings.

Other surviving faience objects are typically softer, and where traces of paint or glaze survive, they do not tend to share the same colour as has been used for this bird figure. In addition, other amuletic falcon forms also bear a suspension loop, which does not appear to have been included for this figure (see for instance British Museum, London EA 68853: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA68853). Additionally the overlapping details of the wings do not match images of the proper Egyptian falcon; in addition to the breaks which would have included human arms, this has led to suggestions that the object was originally intended to represent a ba-bird (Andrews 1994; Hermann et al 2010).
