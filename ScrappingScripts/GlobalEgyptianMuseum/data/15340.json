They sit on a high seat, the back of which is rounded at the top. The two men wear the wigs that were common in the Twenty-Second Dynasty. These were long wigs that reached the shoulders and left the ears uncovered. They were decorated with fine stripes, horizontal on the forehead and vertical at the sides. Montue-mhat and his son wear the sacerdotal, or priestly, skins of large cats and emblems around their necks. Beside each of the men, hieroglyphic inscriptions give their names. On the back of the statue, the upper half of a stela remains. It is dominated by a sun disk that spreads its wings under the sign of the sky. Below, there are two scenes. On the left, Montue-mhat worships and presents offerings to Amun-Re, Re-Horakhty, and Atum. On the right, Nesptah is shown in front of Osiris, Isis, and his father Montue-mhat."}
