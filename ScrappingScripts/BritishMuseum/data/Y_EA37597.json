{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37597"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta standing figure of a female saint or beneficent demon, with a triangular wreath framing her hair, and her hands raised in blessing and protection. She may wear a long-sleeved tunic with clavi indicated by painted verticals. Her breasts are indicated and a garland is placed round her neck. At the rear, behind the head, are blooms on stems in relief, but very faint, and only a couple are visible. There are holes pierced at ear level and at the top of the hair. Two-piece mould. Buff-brown marl clay, with a buff surface, perhaps an Aswan fabric. There are details in fired-on black and red ceramic colours, including large round pendent earrings and a pendant between the breasts.
