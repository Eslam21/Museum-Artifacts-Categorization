Below, the neck is shaped as a peg-shaped cone with a ridge above it, diminishing in size to the bottom where there is a hole pierced in the middle. Finely modelled features with precisely incised details, ears without earrings, slanting eyes and eyebrows, small neatly shaped nose and mouth, with small perforations pierced at each end. Glaze surface all gone; yellow core of fine hard texture; very eroded surface, neck chipped.
