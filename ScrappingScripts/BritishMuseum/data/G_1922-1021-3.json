{"artifact_name": "model; boat", "Object Type": [" model ", " boat "], "Museum number": ["1922,1021.3"], "Description": [" Terracotta model boat. A model of a Nile boat, with high knobbed and pointed stern and rounded bows, decked and with a rounded double-arched cabin, presumably representing a reed structure: the whole boat may be of papyrus construction. In front of the cabin is a ladder-patterned crosspiece, and square impressions near the bow and the stern may be hatchways. The underside rounds down to a flattish bottom of oval shape decorated with longitudinal grooves, with an extension under the stern and two extensions towards the bow. A hole is pierced vertically at the bow, and another, perhaps a firing-vent, enters the front of the cabin. The hole in the bow may show that this is a pull-along toy. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous light-brown Nile silt (perhaps with a mixing of a light-coloured marl clay), containing some white inclusions.
