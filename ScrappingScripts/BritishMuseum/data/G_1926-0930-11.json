{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.11"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Hathor. Hathor, naked, with her hands to her sides, and modelled in the round. Her hair descends in divided locks on her upper back and beside her face; Isis-locks fall to her shoulders, and she wears a plain wreath: there was no kalathos. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a grey core. A few traces of an overall white dressing survive; the wreath was painted red. A hole has been bored into the legs in modern times for mounting the figure on a stand.
