", " Such \u2018Asiatic\u2019 looking male figurines date to between the mid 7th to late 6th centuries BC, with parallels from Cyprus (Karageorghis 1995, 19-21, Type I(ii)56-7). Karageorghis argues the \u2018Assyrian\u2019 look may coincide with Assyrian domination of Cyprus during the seventh century BC (1995, 21). See EA 50126, 50127, 50128, 50130 (EA 1911,0710.102, 1911,0710.103, 1911,0710.105) also from Naukratis. Context from register. A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum and Boston MFA registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.
