The crocodile clearly stands for Egypt or more specifically Cleopatra, tied like a dog to the two classic symbols of Roman victory. It may also refer to the presence of veterans of the Actium campaign settled in N\u00eemes by Octavian. These coins circulated widely in Gaul and on the northern frontier of the empire. The obverse shows the busts of Augustus (right) and his great friend and chief lieutenant, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (left)."], "Bibliographic references": [" RIC1 / The Roman Imperial Coinage, vol. 1 (158) (type) ", " RPC1 / Roman provincial coinage.
