All sherds in this group are small and offer very little by way of information beyond the fact that they come from light-walled chalices. The decoration on sherds belonging to this group is also poorly or carelessly drawn (Lemos 1991, 93). Although identified by Lemos as a chalice, Williams points out that the sherd has a significantly different profile from that of a chalice, as the vessel narrows, but clearly continues, near the bottom of the sherd. He suggests that the sherd may have formed the top portion of a phallus cup (Williams 2006a, 128). For a similar spur, this time complete, see British Museum 1924,1201.203, which comes from a closely similar pot."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
