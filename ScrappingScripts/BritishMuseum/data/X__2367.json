This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The association of the name of Menkheperra with the name of Ptah framed by red crowns appears on scarabs under Horemheb, but the design is mainly attested during the early Ramessid period. Numerous corrupted variants for which the link with the god Ptah is lost are also known later (on the different variants of this design and its evolution from the Ramesside Period till the Late Period, see: Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 290-291, \u00a7 1311). The motive is so schematic that the name of Ptah and the red crowns are not recognisable. Late variants of this motif are attested at Matmar cemetery (mainly 8th-7th c. BC) (Brunton 1948, pl. LXII, 26), Tell el-Ajjul in Palestine (Rowe 1936, no. 519) and other numerous places in the Mediterranean area such as Cyprus, Sicilia, Carthage (Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 1311; see various cruciform compositions with the name of Menkheperra in Gorton, 1996, 131, Type XXXVI, nos 36-44, and especially 44 for this piece, but note that this scarab is in steatite and not glazed composition, so it should not be in her type XXXVI). The Bristol collection holds a series of early scarabs from Naukratis, often said to come from the Scarab Factory, and which were not illustrated in earlier publications. Petrie illustrated several other early examples of scarabs and scaraboids. The presence of this early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
