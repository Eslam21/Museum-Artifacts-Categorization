{"artifact_name": "axe; cord; handle", "Object Type": [" axe ", " cord ", " handle "], "Museum number": ["EA58074"], "Description": [" Large thin axe-head: The three perforations are slightly misaligned. One lug is broken. The blade is quite thickly corroded in parts. The line of the haft is clearly preserved on both faces. There is no obvious sign of wear. Chased in one face is a single hieroglyph. The haft consists of a long cylindrical piece of yellow-coloured wood, which is notched and cracked at various points along its length. It curves and thickens towards the top, where the wood has been split to make a socket for the blade. The haft in this area bears the impress of five evenly spaced binding cords. Corroded metal from the blade adheres in some quantity to the sides of the socket. "], "Cultures/periods": [" First Intermediate (?) ", " Middle Kingdom (?)
