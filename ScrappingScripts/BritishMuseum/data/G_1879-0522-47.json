They were made and used across the Roman world and the form is found in ivory and bronze of the same period (Cesnola 1882, 174 and figs 161-163 (all from Cyprus): 161 is made of glass, where they are described as hair pins; see also Richter 1915, 466, no. 1860, also from Cyprus). Chavane (1990, nos 692-4 with refs) describes several examples from more recently-excavated tombs in Amathus on Cyprus. Of the two examples in Toronto discussed by Hayes, both also from Cyprus, one (Hayes 1975, 158 no. 656A) is 'perhaps Italian' as it is similar to Isings' Form 79 (Isings 1957, 94-5), but the fabric of the other (Hayes 1975, 158-8 no. 656B) resembles Cypriot or Syrian fabrics.
