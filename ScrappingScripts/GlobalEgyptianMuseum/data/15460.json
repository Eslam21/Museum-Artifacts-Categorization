She may appear in the form of a woman with the head of a lioness. She was known by various names in different parts of Egypt: Sekhmet \"the Powerful\" at Memphis; Seshemtet and Bastet in the Delta; in the South, Matit \"the Dismemberer\"; Mehit, \"the Seizer\" and Pasht. These names reflect the terror the lioness causes. This depiction shows this sacred animal, the lioness, lying on the ground. The statue is well sculpted and all the features of the animal are realistic and clearly visible."}
