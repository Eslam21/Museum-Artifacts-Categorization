{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA22333"], "Description": [" Intact amphora of coarse red siltware pottery, with a small foot from which the sides widen to an angular shoulder before converging to a narrow, cylindrical neck. There is a handle at either side of the neck, running between the neck and the shoulder. At the top of the neck is an external roll-rim, which is slightly chipped. The exterior of the vase bears remains of a pale greenish-cream slip. The micaceous fabric contains many voids from burnt-out chaff, but hardly any grit. Ther is a deep crack in one side and a fragment has been replaced. The incised mark on the shoulder is the excavator's number.
