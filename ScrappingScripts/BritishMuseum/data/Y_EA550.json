He wears a long braided wig with uraeus, a long gauffered garment over a stiffened short skirt, and sandals. A fan symbolising his office is attached to his back. Above and in front of him is an inscription incised in six vertical columns containing a prayer to Ra. Slight mutilation has occurred at the base and on the raised border, but the text and relief, apart from minor abrasions, are perfectly preserved. Some very faint traces of red paint on the body and blue within the hieroglyphs are still visible.
