The rear shows wooden impression like from a bolt, perpendicular to it the impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.18 cm. The front has a small flat area with downwards bent sides. On the flat area parts of an oval scarab-like seal-impression. Visible is a thin circumferential line. In the lower middle part a stylised nbw sign (Gardiner S12), above it a horizontal oval field with a line, inside a spiral that continued further to the left. A small nfr-sign at the right end of the seal. The same motif is found on EA86920 and EA86923 and the latter shows that to the left of the nbw-sign there is an ankh.
