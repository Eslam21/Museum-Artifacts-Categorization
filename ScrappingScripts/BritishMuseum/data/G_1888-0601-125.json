A contemporary figurine group of Aphrodite and Eros figure, probably from Halicarnassus (British Museum GR1868,0405.67), with identical clay, paint and subject, is also thought to be of Corinthian origin (Higgins 1954, 265). The style of the figures suggests one should also consider very early Hellenistic terracottas that may place this piece slightly later in the 4th century BC. NA analysis by Hughes, suggests this was not made from the same fabric as Corinthian 'Tanagra style' figures in the British Museum (Hughes 1996, 301).
