", " Scaraboids in the shape of a ram's head pertain to a common series produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d and winged beetle is a popular motif on scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. This specimen belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype A9a-10, see especially A10 for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122). The motif of a winged beetle can also be found on a scarab in Egyptian blue, found in Naukratis (Petrie 1925, pl. XI, no. 595; Gorton 1996, 122, type XXXIV, A8).
