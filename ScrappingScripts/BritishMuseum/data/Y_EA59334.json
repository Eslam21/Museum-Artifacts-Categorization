{"artifact_name": "collar", "Object Type": ["collar"], "Museum number": ["EA59334"], "Description": [" Glazed composition open-work broad collar: the top row represents yellow and blue mandrake fruits; the middle row is composed of green date palm leaves and the lowest of yellow, white and mauve lotus petals. Between the pendants are strung tiny disc beads in red, blue, mauve or yellow. Even the two triangular terminals into which the stringing threads pass to emerge as a single united cord at each side of the collar take the shape of a lotus inlaid in red, yellow, blue and green to indicate the individual petals. All the elements were made in open moulds, as their backs are flat and not detailed.

This collar was found complete but the original order of stringing could not be determined. Bibliography: A. Scott-James, 'The British Museum book of flowers' (London, 1989), p.24-5, fig.17; B.
