{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86258"], "Description": [" Complete scarab, made of steatite. Fine details carved, light-grey colour with whitish-beige glaze. The division between elytra and prothorax is indicated by an incised line, as is the suture. The outer lines of the elytra as well as the prothorax are shown with two lines. The humeral callosities are shown by triangles. Head, eyes and clypeus with 4 lobes preserved (originally probably 5 lobes). The side shows the legs in fine relief with hairs indicated by small diagonal, parallel lines. Underneath the base part. The back of the scarab is not perfectly symmetrical, one side (the right of the beetle) is higher than the other and therefore it looks a bit irregular. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base very close to the edge. In the middle a seated deity with beard and wAs-sceptre is shown, maybe Ptah, facing to the right a cartouche with very small sign, maybe (wsr-mAa.t-Ra-...-Ra?)|. Behind the deity on the left a falcon bird with legs(?) and protective wings in direction of the deity. A Sn-ring between it and the deity. High quality. Perforation along the longitudinal side.
