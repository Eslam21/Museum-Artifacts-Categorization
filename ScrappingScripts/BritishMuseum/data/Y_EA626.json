{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA626"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Decree of Teti: the stela contains nine lines of text, carved in simple incised hieroglyphs, comprising a decree of the King Teti concerned with the freeing of temple-land from local taxes. It contains the name of one official, the \u1ec9my-r \u0160m\u2018w, Ny-k\u0292w-'Izz\u1ec9. In many places the surface of the stone is so worn that only occasional traces of signs can be seen. There is great difficulty in deciding in some cases whether the visible marks represent traces of signs or not. The only significant change is in the date where the reading '\u0292bd 4' seems certain. The stone is hard but the surface has suffered much from rubbing. There is no colour.
