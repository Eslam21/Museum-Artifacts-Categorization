{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Isis. A large figure of \u2018Isis-Aphrodite anasyr(o)mene\u2019, perhaps Isis-Bubastis, holding up the front of her tunic to show her pubic area; the back of the garment falls in curved folds of drapery beside her legs. She stands on a small, round fronted, inadequate plinth. Her hair is parted in the middle and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears an enormous wreath with decorative elements, including discs with raised points, bound across the front with a narrow horizontal garland tied at each side; leaves fall beside her upper arms. Below the leaves hang wide ribbons from the headdress. From the top of the wreath rises a large flaring kalathos, decorated with long tongues or petals and an Isis/Hathor-crown of cow\u2019s horns, disc and feathers. The back is largely plain, with a small circular vent. White paint on kalathos, dress and headdress, red paint on legs and feet. Hollow, made in a two-piece mould, with a vent in the back. Orange-brown Nile Delta silt fabric with a red-brown surface and abundant gold mica, quartz and some white inclusions. Kalathos is chipped.

", " Her hands, while holding up the tunic (which has short sleeves), are in the same pose as the naked Hathor figures discussed by Bailey (2008, nos 2991\u20133000, in the British Museum). Four very close examples known from Naukratis (Bailey 2008, nos. 3006-7; British Museum GR 1888,0601.111; GR 1886,0401.1451; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.919; 88.918). Parallel dated first half of first century AD (head and shoulder fragment without a kalathos, Philipp 1972, figs 19 and 20). Close parallels perhaps from Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.P.233) and from Luxor (Christie\u2019s Sale Catalogue, 8 December 1993, lot 95). Parallel from early 2nd century BC context in Tell Atrib (Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 46). Similar pieces from Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt (Dunand 1973, pl. 21; Dunand 1979, 186-7, no. 60; Dunand 1990, no. 360-1) and Mellawi in Middle Egypt (Perdrizet 1921, no. 157). This example is published in varios volumes (Walters 1903, C575; Bailey 2008, 3007; Pagenstecher 1923, 115, fig. 121; Fischer 1994, 332, no. 816).
