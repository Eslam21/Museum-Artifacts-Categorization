Highly variable in form and reminiscent of both drummer (Thomas Type L-M.1.4) and phallic figures (Thomas Type L-I.5.8-10) figures. \u2018Rude stone figures\u2019 were recognised by Petrie to be a local, early production, dating them to the 6th-4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886, 22, 34, 36, 40-1, 46, pl.19).
