{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.133"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of engraved rock art on a boulder, showing three giraffe figures and a dog all pecked and infilled, upright and facing right. The largest giraffe is in the centre, flanked by a slightly smaller one to the left and a much smaller (calf?) to the right. All giraffes have long tails, clearly delineated horns and ears and projections from the face (possibly pronounced median ossicones: mid-facial horn-like protuberances found in northern giraffe subspecies). The two larger giraffes have flat, forward- pointing (anthropomorphic?) feet. The dog is depicted with legs outstretched as if running toward the largest giraffe. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.

There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " mammal ", " dog "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi Hamra "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.133"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWHA0010005 (TARA number) "]}
