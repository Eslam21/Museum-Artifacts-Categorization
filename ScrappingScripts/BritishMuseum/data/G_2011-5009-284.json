From Cyprus. It may have had a wheel-made base originally, now lost and could have come from a number of Cypriot types. Dated to the late Cypro-Archaic Period, or the late 6th to early 5th century BC (Karageorghis 1998, no. I(v)d.5 and also no. II(iii)1&2 and II(vi) types). White coating may be post depositional. 'Early Archaic' parallel from Lindos (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 82, no. 1882, holding pig). Parallels from the Heraion of Samos (Schmidt 1968, 51, T1961, T1913, T1799), part of Schmidt 's group 4, were dated 600BC-560BC, though recent redating by Henke (2011, 219; 2013 pers.comm) suggest this group may date to the 7th century BC.
