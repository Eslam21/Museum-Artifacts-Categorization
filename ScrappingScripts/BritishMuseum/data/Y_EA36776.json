{"artifact_name": "battle-axe", "Object Type": ["battle-axe"], "Museum number": ["EA36776"], "Description": [" Large crescentic axe-head: with 11 rivet-holes, three in the central tang, four in each of the lateral tangs. The upper tip of the blade is missing. The cutting edge has been damaged by corrosion in parts but bears no clear signs of wear. There is superficial damage on both faces. The blade is attached to a tubular casing, made of silver, which probably once enclosed a wooden haft, now disappeared. The tubing contains several cracks and holes and its upper part is lost, revealing the metal rivets. Since its acquisition, the casing has been reinforced. None of the rivets are complete. Some are missing, others have suffered corrosion damage. All were once capped with silver studs, only one of which now survives intact. At the bottom the casing contains a small aperture of uncertain purpose.
