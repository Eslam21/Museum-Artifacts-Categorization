{"artifact_name": "statuette", "Object Type": ["statuette"], "Museum number": ["EA8495"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone statuette base of the official Hay. The damaged outline of the feet of the statuette are visible across the top of the base. In front of the feet are two horizontal lines of incised text with traces of blue paint inside the hieroglyph signs. White paint is visible across the top of the base and the slim borders underneath the text have clear traces of red colour. The sides of the base are also inscribed with two separate lines of text that begin at the front and conclude across the back. Traces of black paint are visible in the hieroglyphs and red paint in the borders for this inscription. The bottom of the base includes a raised relief carving of a male head, wearing a short styled wig and an incense cone. There are thick traces of a black colour across the wig and around the eye, mouth, and chin. The edges of the statue base along the top are chipped, and part of the inscription is lost at the top of the base and on the left side.

Both sets of inscriptions also feature a dedication to the goddess Hathor. The male figure Nebamentet has been identified with another individual of the same name who was the son of Kasa and known from several other surviving evidence within Deir el-Medina (e.g EA 5634, British Museum, London: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA5634; Bierbrier 1982). Though the relationship between the named figures is not specified within the inscription, it has been proposed that this monument represents the workman Hay, son of Huy, a figure also attested from the site of Deir el-Medina (owner of Deir el-Medina tomb 328; Bruy\u00e8re 1930), and who is known to have had a son-in-law named Nebamentet (Bierbrier 1982). The male figure in carved relief on the bottom of the base is likely unrelated to the original function of the monument, but it was perhaps used later as a trial piece for an artist to practice his skill in carving relief images.
