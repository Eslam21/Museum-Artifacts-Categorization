Incised details, serving to render the representation more precise, are only used to highlight the tail. The degree of simplification employed in this object is important, as the fish shape is simple and leaves plenty of room for the preparation of the cosmetic: the fins and the tail follow the general outline and have lost their characteristic details."}
