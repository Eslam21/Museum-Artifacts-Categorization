", " This piece was found with a large group of copper alloy finds in a house located to the south of the town (Petrie 1886, 41). The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). This group-figure belongs to the type G30a in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss and was already published (Weiss 2012, 351, 846, Nr. 1244, Pl. 60g). It is unique in the corpus of Naukratis.
