The lip of the vase and nose of the woman are broken away. The upper part of the alabastron is terminating in the bust of a woman on top of whose head the vase's lip was placed. The figure is wearing a thin veil, falling over the hair and shoulders towards the front; the ears are covered. The face is rather rounded with slim, fairly long, oblique, the lower lid is more or less straight, the upper plastically rendered. The mouth is smiling broadly with full lips; the nose is short (and chipped). The back is left round. Only top part preserved; black substance sticking to neck.
