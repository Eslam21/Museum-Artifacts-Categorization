", " These socketed trilobate types are common in the Middle East from the 7th century BC and subsequently in Greece and Egypt. However, this example has good parallels from the mid 5th to 4th centuries BC (Baitinger 2001, figs 225, Dreifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIB1). James dates this type (James 2004, figs 668-670) between the Achaemenid and early Hellenistic periods. These short socket types come in before the 5th century BC, with parallels from Tell Dafana and the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Snodgrass 1964, 153 shaft-less three edged socketed Form 3B3; Erdmann 1973, 35 Form CI3, dated to 7th to 4th centuries BC and into the Hellenistic period; Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.5 dated to late 7th to 6th centuries BC).
