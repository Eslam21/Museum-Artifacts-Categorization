XVIII, no. 10). Ibex was a popular motif on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids (on the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 productions, see Webb forthcoming). It belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 96-97, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A127-139, see especially A129 for this piece). Some examples of scarabs and scaraboids from Naukratis displaying this motif are illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 15-19 and Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 10-12. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
