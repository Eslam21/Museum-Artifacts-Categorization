{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74712"], "Description": [" Portrait of a woman in encaustic on limewood: panel bearing an encaustic portrait of a woman wearing a gold hair-pin, earrings, emerald pendant and a purple mantle and tunic with a black clavus; cracks run from the broken upper edge. Portrait of a woman in encaustic on limewood: minor cracks run from the broken upper edge of the panel. Patches of the painted surface are lost over the proper left cheek. The lower edge of the panel is unpainted. The face, slightly turned to the viewer's left, is drawn in yellow ochre lines on a background of greenish-grey distemper. The flesh tones were built up from the undercoat, which blends into them around the edges of the cheeks and chin to give volume to a plump face. The tunic and mantle are painted in purple with reddish tones. The clavus on the proper right shoulder is almost black, the seam on the shoulder appearing as a gap in the paint. The bun is secured with a round-headed gold pin; the hoop earrings are strung with an emerald between two pearls. Around her neck the woman wears a gold chain with a pendant emerald in a circular gold setting. A second necklace is threaded with emeralds interspersed with gold. The black hair rises in tiers of curls above the brow and is coiled into a large plaited bun on the crown of the head. The eyes are very large and brown, with fine plucked eyebrows rendered perhaps with the cestrum. The small pink lips are pursed. There are pink highlights on the ivory cheeks and cream on the nose, above the mouth and on the double chin. The drapery and jewellery are carelessly painted in comparison with the head and neck.

Borg (1996, 96-7) has linked this portrait with the image of Isarous (Walker and Bierbrier 1997, 45-6 no. 19), an earlier work by the same artist. The hairstyle follows the fashion of the court of Domitian (AD 81-96), but the jewellery and the drapery of the mantle over the proper left shoulder only suggest a date in the early years of the second century ad.
