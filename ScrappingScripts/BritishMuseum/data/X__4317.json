This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The cult of the ithyphallic god Min is attested in Naukratis on the colossal statue of Horemheb, dated to the early Ptolemaic period. The inscription mentions that this Naukratite was a priest of Min (Yoyotte 1994-95, 671-673; Guermeur 2005, 135-137). Min appears however rarely in the material of Naukratis. See nonetheless the small amuletic figure in glazed composition BM 1885,1101.47. This figure belongs to the type 72 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss, a type mainly attested in Bubastis (Weiss 2012, 160-161, 617-619, Pl. 19 g-h, Typ 72). Even though the MFA database lists the Scarab Factory as the findspot, the EEF list seems to list this object separately from those objects found in the Scarab Factory. Caution is therefore required for the specific findspot of this piece and, subsequently, its dating should not be only limited to the activity of the Scarab Factory in the 26th dynasty.
