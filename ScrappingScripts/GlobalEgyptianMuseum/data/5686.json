{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "8526", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "ARCHITRAVE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE; LOW RELIEF", "Height": "54.5 cm", "Width": "70 cm", "Depth": "13 cm", "Name": "Architrave fragment of Kay-nefer", "Description": "This architrave fragment comes from the mastaba of Kay-nefer in the western cemetery of Giza. In addition to the cult chamber in the centre of the mastaba, other cult chambers were added outside the eastern wall. This piece may well have been placed above the entrance to such a chamber. On the left, the owner of the tomb Kay-nefer is shown, wearing a broad kilt and a striated wig. In his left hand he is holding a long staff. Of the three horizontal lines of inscription, only the ends are preserved, but it was probably a prayer to Anubis for a good burial in the necropolis."}
