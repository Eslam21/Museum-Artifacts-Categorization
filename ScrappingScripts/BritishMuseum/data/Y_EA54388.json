{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA54388"], "Description": [" Bronze figure of divine consort or queen: the woman, who stands with her left leg slightly advanced, wears a traditional tight-fitting dress, the skirt of which is inlaid in a pattern that may represent a beaded overskirt. The hem, the waistband, and the two straps of the bodice are inlaid with linear patterns. A small necklace is indicated, but most of the space between the straps is filled with a figure of Osiris inlaid in gold, facing right, and wearing an 'atef' crown. The woman's long wig is studded with tiny strips of metal, which represent little gold or silver rings, threaded on the tresses. On her wig is a cap in the form of a vulture with wings outspread beside her face. The bird's head, which may have been replaced by a uraeus, is broken off. Also lost are the tall headdress, which fitted over the post on the top of the head; the arms, which had been made separately; and the feet, with the base to which they were attached. Perhaps the worst damage of all is that inflicted on the face, which has lost not only its inlaid eyes but almost all details of the features. It is likely that the face was covered with sheet gold, which was roughly pried off for the value of the metal. This figure has a high, narrow waist, from which a long continuous line joins the hips to the low-slung curve of the thighs. Her face is round and broad. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 21st Dynasty (?)

Thus this woman was royal, but a more precise identification hinges on her date. Given the timelessness of her costume and the lack of a name or other inscriptions, the figure can only be dated only on the basis of its style, which is fortunately quite distinctive.
