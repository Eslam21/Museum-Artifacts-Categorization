Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice kraters. In this instance, however, the thickness of the sherd suggests that the vessel was not necessarily large and thick-walled. Chalices in this group also display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
