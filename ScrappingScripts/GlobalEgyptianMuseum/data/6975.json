However, one of the panels in the width of the vessel bears four very faded lines of an inscription painted in white (Coptic?). All around the vat, right below the thick terracotta roll that borders the orifice, there is another, much better preserved, short Coptic inscription (a curse against all those who would fraudulently open this vat). Additionally, there is a decorative motif of double line segments oriented in such a way to create a jagged pattern on all four panels, between the line of letters and the roll."}
