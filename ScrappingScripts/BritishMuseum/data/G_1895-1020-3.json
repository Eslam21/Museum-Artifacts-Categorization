A fragmentary group of Eros sleeping on a bed and bound by Psyche. Eros is naked and his hair has a braid on the top, from front to rear, and his curls fall on each side. Psyche is dressed in a long chiton with an overfall and has butterfly wings. Her hair is parted in the centre and is brought up into a mass on top of her head. She leans over the head of the bed, standing on a low stool (her feet are broken away), and holds the ends of a rope in each hand, the rope passing round Eros\u2019 waist, under his body and emerging at the side of his head; further ropes bind his right ankle. Much of the bed and Eros\u2019 lower legs are lost, but the surviving leg of the bed is like that of a lion, supporting the bedend, which is padded, with a fringe. Eros sleeps on his left side and reposes his head on his right hand, which rests on the end of the bed. The back is plain, with a small circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Yellow-buff marl clay.
