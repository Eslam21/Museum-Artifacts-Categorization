{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Egyptian ithyphallic limestone figure. Representation of naked figure, probably originally Harpocrates. Seated with knees raised and phallus extending forward. Subsequently modified: face recut with almond shaped eyes, angular features and pointed chin or beard. The phallus has been cut off close to its base and the front modified to form a vulva(?), which was painted red. Possibly a representation of a eunuch? Crudely carved from soft Egyptian brown limestone. Painted red, with black eyes and beard.

", " The final, modified form is very unusual, though this appears to be modified from a very common form known at Naukratis (The Petrie Museum UC16475; British Museum GR1965,0930.968, 1965,0930.973, 1965, 0930.941, 1965,0930.938, 1886,0401.1515) with further parallels attributed to Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge E.SU.154, E.97.1914; British Museum GR2011,5011.5, 2011,5011.4). Parallel found on Cyprus (Karageorghis 1984, 219, pl.42.3, fig.2, Louvre no. 2114, p219) and unprovenanced (British Museum EA90341). Very close to common 4th and 3rd century BC examples holding a drum (Thomas type L-I.6) known from Memphis and Saqqara (Quibell, 1907; Martin 1981; 1987). Uncertain whether these represent earlier variants of L-I.6 or just regional variants. Dated approximately 5th to 3rd century BC. Modifications appear to have been made to the face and the phallus, which were subsequently painted. The modification may have been meant to represent a eunuch. Alternatively the modifications may have been relatively recent, made to increase the value of the object, if acquired, rather than excavated by Petrie. Karageorghis, V. 1984.
