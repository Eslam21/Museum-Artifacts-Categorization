{"artifact_name": "musical pipe", "Object Type": ["musical pipe"], "Museum number": ["EA6387"], "Description": [" Fragments of a double(?)-reed pipe. The object is assembled from at least two fragments, with a wooden strengthener inserted between the third hole on the front and the first hole on the back. There are four holes on the front and at least two on the back, an arrangement which suggests that, in spite of the convincing nature of the joins, fragments of a double pipe have been put together in error. The holes seem to have been burnt into the object; they are unevenly shaped and spaced. Both ends of the object have been diagonally cut and the back is badly damaged. The bore is elliptical and varies considerably.
