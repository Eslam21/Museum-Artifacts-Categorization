In the upper register the goddess Hathor is seated on a throne on the left in front of an altar on which stands a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. The workman Nefersenut kneels on the right with one arm raised in adoration and the other holding an offering of incense. In the lower register three figures kneel facing left with their arms raised in worship. They are identified as his son the workman P\u0292-nb (Paneb), his son \u02bf\u0292-p\u1e25ty (Aapehty), and P\u0292-nb (Paneb) the son of his daughter. The stela is well preserved apart from numerous small gouges on the surface. There appear to be no traces of colour.
