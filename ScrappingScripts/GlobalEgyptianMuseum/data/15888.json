Its owner might have been a high priest as can be seen from his shaven head and the leopard skin over his shoulders. He raises his hands in worship, in front of the divine couple, Isis and Osiris. Osiris is enveloped in a shroud and holds in his hands the flail and the Heka and \"Was\" scepters. Behind him, his wife Isis wears the headdress of Hathor; her right arm is raised and she is holding the Ankh sign in her left hand. Between the priest and the divine couple are the lotus and papyrus plants that are offered by the priest. Eight vertical lines of hieroglyphic inscriptions, which include the names of Isis and Osiris, occupy the lower part of the stela."}
