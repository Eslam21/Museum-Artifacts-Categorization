{"artifact_name": "chalice", "Object Type": ["chalice"], "Museum number": ["EA26226"], "Description": [" Blue glazed composition chalice: with a tall trumpet-like cup in the form of a blue lotus. It is exceptional in its elegant proportions and detailed floral relief on both stem and cup. The cup portion was made over a form, giving the interior a smooth surface, while the exterior relief decoration was painstakingly hand carved. A profusion of petals, some with central veining, have at their base eight papyrus umbels alternating with five smaller ones below; along the mould-made stem and flaring foot are inverted palm leaves. All are depicted with crisp precision, and must surely be the result of additional hand tooling after removal from the mould. Other details also appear to have been strengthened before firing. The stem was attached to the cup with a watery glazed composition paste that has obscured some of the decoration at the area of join. The foot has been repaired.

Nevertheless, the function of these glazed composition chalices is not fully understood, and it should not be assumed that they all served the same purpose.
