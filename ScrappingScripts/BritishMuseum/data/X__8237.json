", " A relatively large corpus of sphendonoids weights have been found in various sites of Egypt and Naukratis provided quite a few of these (Petrie1886, pl. XXIII, \u201cbarrel\u201d type; Court-Marty 1990, 26, fig. 7, fig. 26). Most of them are made out of bronze, like for this specimen, but haematite is very well attested and other stones occur also. This type, particularly well-represented in the Near-East, appeared in the New Kingdom and persisted till the Late Period. The sphendonoid assemblage at Naukratis represents the smaller denominations and seems to have been used to weight with utmost precision quantities of commodities smaller than those weighed with most of the Egyptian style domed weights. Such observation has already been done on the sphendonoids weights in general (Court-Marty 1990, 26), and in particular for those found on the Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Uluburun (Pulak 2000, 260). Naukratis ones however are of even smaller value and several sphendonoid weights, which comes either from Naukratis or Tell Defenneh, are even less than half a gram (Court-Marty 1990, 26). The loss of weight due to corrosion on bronze examples is, nonetheless, difficult to assess for such small weights. Sphendonoids weights are usually associated to the deben-kedet and Near Eastern shekel standards (Court-Marty 1990, 26). Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
