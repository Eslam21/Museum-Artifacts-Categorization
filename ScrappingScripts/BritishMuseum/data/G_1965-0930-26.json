Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior; given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two white bands (Williams 1983, 169). '32' is written on a paper label on the inside and on the outside; '92', apparently deleted, is written on the outside.
