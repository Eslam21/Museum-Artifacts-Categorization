These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. The number in Petrie's catalogue,172, is written in ink on the underside."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis. Part I., 1884-85 (pl.
