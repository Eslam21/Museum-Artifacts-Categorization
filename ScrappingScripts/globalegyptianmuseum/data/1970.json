{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:735", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "QASR EL-SAGHA ?", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "PAINTED; CARVED", "Height": "10 cm", "Width": "9 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Painted limestone dyad", "Description": "The excavation records are unclear, but this headless figure of a man and woman was registered as coming from a Middle Kingdom cemetery near modern Dima, presumably referring to the site at Qasr el-Sagha, north of the Faiyum lake. If so, it is presumably a funerary figure of a man and woman. However its style seems later, and it may be a votive image of a god and goddess from the main site at Dima, a substantial town of the Ptolemaic Period (305-30 BC). If of the earlier date, it is an unusual example from this part of Egypt. Further evidence for its early date may come from the pottery registered in the same year as Middle Kingdom and from Dima."}
