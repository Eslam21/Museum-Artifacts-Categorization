They comprise six generations. The oldest stela is that of An-em-hor, who died in 217 BC at the age of 72. The form and text are still in the tradition that reaches back into the third millennium. Nevertheless it also reveals the contemporary style and refined writing system of the Ptolemaic Period. Underneath the meticulously cut black-painted hieroglyphs is a short text in Demotic."}
