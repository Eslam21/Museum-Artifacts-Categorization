", " Gutch's number partly preserved in pencil on rear.

Kore heads BM GR1886,0401.1400 and 1421 from Naukratis also in similar micaceous orange fabric were thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9), but are probably Milesian and Jones' NAA analysis of BM1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). Simillar example from Samos dated to the 6th century BC (Tsakos 2007, 194, pl.26.4). Higgins cites parallels from Cumae, Selinus, Lindos, Ialysus and Thera (Maximova 1927, no.68; Blinkenberg 1931,515ff; Higgins 1954, 50) and an East Greek kore flask parallel from Clazomenae is dated to the mid 6th century BC (Ersoy 2007, pl. 19.2).
