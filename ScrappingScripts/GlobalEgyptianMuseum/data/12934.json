The roundel contains one imperfectly preserved line of hieroglyphs (Inscription A). Below to the right is depicted a man seated on a lion-legged chair, wearing short wig, and knee-length kilt; one arm is raised higher than the other toward the table of offerings depicted to the left. Above him are cut three lines of crudely in-cised hieroglyphic text (Inscription B). Facing him, on the left of the offering-table, stand two men with close-cropped hair and short kilts; the central torso ares is indistinct, but the righthand standing man seems to have an arm raised over the offering-table. Above these two figures can be seen three vertical lines of hieroglyphic text (Inscription C). Above and to the left of the lefthand figure, and to the right of the seated figure, roughly incised lines form ir-regular patterns where a border might be expected. Traces of red pigment are visible in the outlines of the figures."}
