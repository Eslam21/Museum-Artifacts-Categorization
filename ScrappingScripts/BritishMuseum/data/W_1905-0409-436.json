Has been drilled for analysis; composition tested in Dept of Scientific Research and proven to be brass with 70% copper, 8.9% lead, 0.46% tin, 21.1% zinc (same composition proven for the lid which is suggested to be from the same melt). Part of 1905,0409.443 (BM.98937). This is one of the very few identifiable Byzantine imports to be found in an excavated context within the Sasanian empire and adds to the evidence for the textually attested Christian community at Nineveh during the Late Sasanian period but a similar example was recovered during the 1898/99 season of excavations in the first level of Trench 15 on the Acropole at Susa, where it was cited as evidence for \"une colonie chr\u00e9tienne\" during the Sasanian period (J. de Morgan, G.
