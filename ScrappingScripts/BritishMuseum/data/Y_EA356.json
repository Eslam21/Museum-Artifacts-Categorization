{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA35597"], "Description": [" Granite stela of Peribsen: a tall, narrow stela of grey granite, tapering slightly from the base to a rounded top. The back of the stela is only roughly shaped and the base is broken. All the surfaces have been worn smooth by the action of wind-blown sand, but only the front has been worked by hammering to a flat surface suitable for bearing the inscription. This consists of the serekh of Peribsen surmounted by the animal of Seth, the latter having been hammered out at a later date. The signs are executed in low relief without any sharp edges.
