Wadi Sura (also spelled Sora) is a valley on the western edge of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s western desert. There, two shallow caves lie on the right at the entrance to the inlet, one smaller than the other and both containing rock paintings. Hans Rhotert designated the caves C and D. Cave C is the larger and contains the paintings of the famous \u2018swimming\u2019 figures inspiring those in \u2018The English patient\u2019. Cave D, which is close by, contains a single scene of cattle and archers. These caves were discovered, and the valley named, in 1933 by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy. There are several other rock art sites nearby, some discovered by Alm\u00e1sy and Rhotert in the same year, or by P. A.
