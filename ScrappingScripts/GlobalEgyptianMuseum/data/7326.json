The classification a-b-c-d-e-f is completely arbitrary and the order of the fragments cannot be established with certainty, just as the position of the fragments of P. Lille 114 (a-b-d) compared to those of P. Lille 70 (a-f). According to the P. Lille 70 (e), this could have been a text on natural history, evoking Athens at the fifth century before J.C., or of a dialogue or an oration."}
