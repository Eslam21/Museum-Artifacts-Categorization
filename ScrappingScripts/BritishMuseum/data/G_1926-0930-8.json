The upper part of a female beneficent demon, probably standing, her arms bent at the elbow and the hands outstretched with the palms out-turned. She has two rows of curls over her forehead, with single locks falling each side to her shoulders; at the back her hair is drawn back to a tight band, below which is a loop of hair, spalled during firing by the presence of a stone. A tightly woven wreath surmounts the hair. She is naked except for a necklace with triangular pendants and bracelets with crosshatched decoration. She is lost from above her waist downwards, and there are indications below her arms that drapery may have extended from them to cover her lower body. Summary treatment at the back. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface in places, and a grey core.
