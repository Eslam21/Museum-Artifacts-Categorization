Gardner 1888, 47, makes special note of the find of 'very few' examples, all in very bad condition, of this 'peculiar' class of pottery (i.e. with painted decoration in white on a black glaze) in the Aphrodite sanctuary. He notes the occurrence of both animal and plant designs. Clay analysis with NAA by Hans Mommsen of this piece (sample Nauk 88) remains difficult to interpret; a possible Attic provenance (Mommsen et al. 2012, 440) can probably be discounted in favour of East Greek, notably Chian production, with the chemical composition of the fabric close to Chian pottery (close to chemical group ChiA, cf. Kerschner and Mommsen 2009, 134).
