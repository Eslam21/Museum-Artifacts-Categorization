{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 27815", "Dating": "TUTHMOSIS III/MENKHEPERRE", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "QUARTZITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "70 cm", "Width": "48 cm", "Name": "Stela of Tuthmosis the Third Striding Towards Amun-Re", "Description": "The main scene on this stela shows King Tuthmosis the third striding towards the Theban sun god Amun-Re. He wears the Khepresh Blue Crown of ceremonies and a short kilt with the front projecting stiffly. The god was probably accompanied by his wife Mut, and his son Khonsu, who should have been represented behind him in the left upper part of the stela, which is now lost. Behind the king stands a queen who is offering wine to the god. Her name had been altered to Isis, presumably the name of the king's mother who was not the great royal queen of her husband Tuthmosis the second. It seems that the name of Isis replaced that of another queen-wife of Tuthmosis the third. The figure of the god Amun-Re, and the related text were obliterated during the period of the Amarna heresy. The remaining figure of Amun-Re holds the Was scepter of prosperity in the left hand and the Ankh sign, symbol of long life, in the right. He wears his traditional crown with very tall plumes."}
