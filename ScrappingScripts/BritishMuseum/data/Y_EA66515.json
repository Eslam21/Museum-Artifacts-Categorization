This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, see especially B25 for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122). Though the back is rather eroded, it is possible to recognise a Black African head rather than a Bes head (Gorton 1996, 124, B25): for better preserved examples see BM 1888,0601.56 / EA 35981 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.872.
