{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.3"], "Description": [" Terracotta seated female figure with arms raised. A seated woman, a beneficent demon, with arms upraised in blessing and protection. Her knees are widely spread and the soles of her feet touch. The hair is parted in the centre and is drawn to a bun at the back; there are large piercings from front to back at ear level. She is clothed in a short tunic with long sleeves and probably wears bracelets. The back is summarily treated. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt; the surface is a dark-brown colour, due mainly to an application of varnish in modern times.
