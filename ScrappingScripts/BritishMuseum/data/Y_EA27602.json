This specimen, however, is just a model and not an actual piece of temple equipment. Situlae in metal, decorated or not, are common votive objects of the Late and Ptolemaic Period. They were massively produced ex-votos that visiting pilgrims dedicated in temples and shrines (see the chapter on situlae in Green 1987, 66-115). At least seven specimens were collected from Naukratis early excavations. As on this example, the ithyphallic god Amun-Min appears to be the main god to receive offerings on decorated situlae found in North Saqqara (Green 1987, 66). Green, C.
