The back-pillar bears an inscription requesting that she 'give life, power that (the wearer) may live'. The hole in the back-pillar at mid-height would allow stringing the figure as an amulet either to a mummy net, or to be worn around the neck in life. Such figures began to be produced in faience in large numbers in the Late Period, to be placed over the body during embalming for burial."}
