These were of glazed composition and are distinguished by their skillful modeling and the excellent quality of their blue glaze. None of the surviving examples have votive texts mentioning officials, yet the possibility exists that they were gifts to the king, in the manner of the fine shabtis of Tutankhamun. It is to one of these larger shabtis that this head belonged. From more complete examples it can be deduced that the king also wore an elaborate collar and bracelets, and grasped two hoes in his crossed hands. The standard shabti-spell would have been inscribed in horizontal lines around the body and legs. Bibliography: J.H. Taylor and N.C. Strudwick, Mummies: Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt.
