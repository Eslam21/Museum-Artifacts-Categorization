", " 'The End of the Work' is a ritual that was performed probably at the end of the mummification of Osiris as part of the festivals of the ritual year. It was intended to be recited by a 'scribe of the chamber which is called the House of Life', and includes a symbolic description of that institution, which was the temple scriptorium. The ritual comprises spells against enemies of Osiris and concludes with the placing of a copy of the book as an amulet on the neck of a statue of Osiris. Such divine rites were adopted by private individuals, who became identified with Osiris in death, for their own funerary use, as a gloss in the text makes explicit. Since papyri rarely survive from settlement or temple sites, this manuscript probably came from a tomb. Different temples used distinct figurative systems, and the errors of the copyist of Papayrus Salt indicate how far figurative hieroglyphs were a fluid intellectual practice rather than a regulated system.
