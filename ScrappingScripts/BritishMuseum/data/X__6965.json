{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Yellowish limestone head of a female figure; painted. Cut off at neck (smooth cut, sawn off in modern times?), chipped in various places (nose, ears, eyes, hair\u2026). The face is roundish-oval in shape. The large eyes are protruding and pointed at the outer edges. The slim mouth is smiling; the ears are very small with the left one set higher, making the face look asymmetrical. The head cloth is separated from the forehead by means of a small step, which when seen in profile is slightly dented inwards at this point. At the lower edge of the neck a thick pearl necklace is visible; the back of the head is flat. Very faint traces of red paint on the sides and at back of the hair and between the necklace's pearls, but also at the (modern) cut surface of the neck, hence doubful if ancient.
