{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86790"], "Description": [" Complete preserved seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows one side with flat impressions of two rows of basketry coil and another side with a deeper impression of a somewhat larger coil of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side bears two oval scarab-like impressions from the same seal and a small area that shows traces of textile (?) impression. The motif of the seal shows a lying ram, facing to the left, wearing the double crown and in front as well as behind him D.t-snakes or similar as decorative framing signs. Underneath a division line a winged scarab filling the lower part of the seal.
