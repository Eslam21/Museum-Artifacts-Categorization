{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86957"], "Description": [" Fragment of a larger clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows a darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. On the rear an impression probably from the rim of a vessel, inside impressions of some plant remains, probably as a stopper. The front side of the sealing is shaped slightly convex with many finger impressions and a part that was smoothed, probably with fingers. One complete seal impression and part of a second next to it are preserved from an oval scarab-like seal. The complete example is covered by a finger impression distorting the motif. It looks like three figures in the top, the one on the right seems to be a seated baboon, facing towards the left. Underneath small hieroglyphic sings, maybe an eye on top of strokes on the left and something like mr and nb underneath of the baboon. Black accretion on both sides.
