The text was finally established by Blinkenberg in 1941, and recently discussed in Bresson 2000. Given the Egyptian provenance, the date of the stele and fact that it relates to Rhodes, which is known to have had a stake in the Hellenion at Naukratis, the Ellanion mentioned in the text is most likely the Hellenion of Naukratis.
