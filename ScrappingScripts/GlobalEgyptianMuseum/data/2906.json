{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:256", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "GAME PIECE", "Material": "ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "1.8 cm", "Diameter": "1.8 cm", "Name": "Gaming piece", "Description": "Small piece of milk-white rock, shaped to a conical form, for use as a gaming-piece. In the absence of archaeological context, its interest lies in the date of acquisition, as part of the collection of antiquities formed by Lady Harriet Kavanagh. Her collection with its inventory provides a rare example of a well-documented private group of materials from the 1840s. In this context the date is uncertain, but it may be of the Greco-Roman Period, as conical gaming-pieces of the Middle and New Kingdoms present a narrower neck."}
