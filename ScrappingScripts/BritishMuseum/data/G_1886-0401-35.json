The very small fragment shows pointy roll mouldings that are accompanied by so-called \u2018lips\u2019 which frame the rims of the concave volutes. The curve of the roll mouldings shows after the verification by means of a circle template a diameter of 45 to 50 cm. The fragment is made of a fine-grained and soft limestone.

Therefore is cannot be part of the group showing by Koenigs in the catalogue numbers 5 to 7 of the first temple of Apollo. Furthermore it is not identifiable whether it originates from a corner capital or an altar volute of the Miletian type.
