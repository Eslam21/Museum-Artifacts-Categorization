", " Although the sherd is not discussed by Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012), the sherd might belong to a variant of his Type 5C group of South Ionian cups with everted rims. The interior and exterior rim pattern decorations are not consistent with his Type 5C but the profile and remaining decoration do. Type 5C cups are amongst the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site. This cup type coincides with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18) and Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88).
