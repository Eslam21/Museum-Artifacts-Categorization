Although registered with objects from grave 31, these beads are not recorded among the contents of that grave (F. Ll. Griffith, 'Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology 8 (Liverpool, 1921), 14-15). Possibly they are the 'cruciform' beads from grave 59 (ibid., 10). For parallels to the toggle beads, see ; G. Brunton, 'Qau and Badari' I (London, 1927), pl.XVII, 73, M2. Similar beads were found in the tomb of Djer at Abydos, but these were not pierced, but they had a ridge round the middle for the thread.
