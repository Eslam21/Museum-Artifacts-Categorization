One does not only find them inside or near the tombs of their beneficiaries, but also in the sanctuaries  where the offerings in favour of the gods were also reserved for the deceased. This example, which is in a good state of preservation, bears on its base an inscription mentioning the title and the name of the owner, who is also known by other sources. It dates from the New Kingdom."}
