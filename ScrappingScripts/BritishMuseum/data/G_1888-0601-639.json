", " The item sheered of the front was probably a gorgoneion or panther mask, and the presence of a panther head on a fragment that must be from the same piece, Boston, MFA 86.915, points to the latter. The dimensions of the 'rod' at top right suggest that the fragments of openwork base, 1888,0601.637 and 638 and 1965,0930.441 belong to the same complex. The Boston fragment has a further rod under the lion's paw.
