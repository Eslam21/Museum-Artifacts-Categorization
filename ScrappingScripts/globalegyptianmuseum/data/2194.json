{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1904:512", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "IHNASIYA EL-MADINA/HERAKLEOPOLIS", "Category": "UDJAT-AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "1.9 cm", "Depth": "1.5 cm", "Name": "Amulet of udjat-eye", "Description": "Fine faience amulet in the form of the sacred eye or udjat. The partial degradation of the glaze leaves the original colours uncertain, but the body seems to have been of an olive-green hue, with black details such as pupil and brows. The excavator dated the piece to the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, presumably from a coin in the same context, but the amulet type is pre-Christian, and the quality here suggests a date in the Late Period."}
