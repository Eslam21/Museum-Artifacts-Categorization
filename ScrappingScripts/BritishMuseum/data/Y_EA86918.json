{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86918"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a slightly convex surface with impressions of an organic material like leather, maybe from a leather bag. In the break three impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.16cm. The upper side is flat with the lateral sides bending downwards. About a third of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable is one of three lines in hieroglyphs, showing a very small cartouche with at least 4 signs, but a crack is running through it. The second and third lines are preserved on EA86907 and EA86919 that show the same motif. The second line is written from the right to the left: 'Imn-[R'], nfr, underneath the third row is written from the left to the right: Hr (D2) wDA.t (D10).
