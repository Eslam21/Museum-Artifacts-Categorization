Very few Type 11 cups were found at Naukratis and Schlotzhauer suggests that these may have been made in specific workshops that rarely exported vases to Naukratis. The place of production of Type 11 South Ionian cups is determined as Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.570) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric. The number in Petrie's catalogue, 249, is written in ink on the exterior surface of the sherd. Tem(enos) A\u03a0 in pencil."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
