", " Isis - and particularly featured as Isis nursing - is a goddess relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets made of bronze or glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). On Isis amulets see: Andrews 1994, 48-49, fig. 18; Herrmann et al. 2010, 30-32 (types 4-5). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
