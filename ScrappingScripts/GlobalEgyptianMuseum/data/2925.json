{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:79", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SITULA", "Material": "BRONZE", "Name": "Situla", "Description": "Bronze situla, a deep round-bottomed vessel with separate looped handle attached by suspension rings at the rim of the vessel. The type is known from the New Kingdom, but survives more commonly in Late Period and Ptolemaic deposits. In the later periods it often bears texts and images alluding to its use in funerary rites, by which the deceased received milk as the gift of the goddess Isis every ten days (the Egyptian week). On this example most of the surface has been worn down, but traces of decoration can be seen, notably the lotus flower pattern around the base."}
