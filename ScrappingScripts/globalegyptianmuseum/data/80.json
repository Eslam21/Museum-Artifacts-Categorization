{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.0369", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Height": "8.4 cm", "Width": "11.7 cm", "Depth": "1.4 cm", "Name": "Coptic ostracon", "Description": "The practice of writing texts upon fragments of limestone reappeared during the Byzantine Period (5th-7th centuries AD), after having disappeared during the Graeco-Roman period. This limestone ostrakon is inscribed on both faces with a letter in Coptic. Following the monogram of Christ, the text begins with an invocation to 'the lord, to the god of the apostles, to the prophets, to the martyrs, and to the righteous ones'. The rest is restricted to wishing 'the wisdom of Solomon' and 'the equity of king Ezechias' on the recipient. Given the lack of names of writer and addressee, this text should probably be regarded as a writer's model."}
