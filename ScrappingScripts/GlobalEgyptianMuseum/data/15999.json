{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 13475", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "CAPITAL", "Material": "MARBLE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "65 cm", "Name": "Marble Capital With Basketwork Designs", "Description": "A splendid marble capital is beautifully carved with an interlaced basketwork design. Each side is decorated with a papyrus plant. The capital is hollow, perhaps to be used as a baptismal font containing holy water. This and two others that have been kept in the museum were uncovered in the vicinity of Mahatet el-Raml. They may once have belonged to Alexandria's first cathedral, which was built over the tomb of Saint Mark the Evangelist. Saint Mark brought Christianity to Egypt around AD 40 and was martyred in AD 68. These capitals are evidence of a highly developed art."}
