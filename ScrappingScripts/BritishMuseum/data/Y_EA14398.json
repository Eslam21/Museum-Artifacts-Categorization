{"artifact_name": "figure(?)", "Object Type": ["figure (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA14398"], "Description": [" Limestone bust of a king, a flat plane on the reverse with traces of a proportional grid. He wears the royal nemes headdress with a coiled body of the uraeus cobra extending to his forehead, its head now lost. The horns of the atef-crown also adorning the top of the king\u2019s head. The left side horn is damaged, the lower portion now lost. Underneath the right side horn of the crown is a small circular hole in the stone. The lappets of the nemes wig extend down to the chest, with no surviving indication of any incised detail or pattern. His facial features are worn, but the thin outline of his eyes and brow are still visible. His nose is long and slim, and the mouth is small with the lips pursed together. His jawline is fleshy and rounded. His chest is flat and the sides of the body are flat, with no indication of his arms. At the left and right side of the bust are traces of a proportional grid. On the reverse, the stone is flat with clear lines of the proportional grid particularly visible along the bottom. Towards the centre and top are a number of separately incised rectangles and other shapes, most of these are slightly worn. The sides of the nemes headdress are damaged with some of the upper portion missing, and there are chips to the edges of the bust at the front and both sides. There are small traces of a yellow colour on the right side portion of the nemes around the ear. The bust is now supported by a short modern base.

Such models were used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure the production of an even three-dimensional sculpture; on the reverse of typical surviving trial-pieces, this area usually included an incised proportional grid, though this is not the case for this British Museum royal head. For the significance of the \u2018pendant snake\u2019 as opposed to the usually raised uraeus, see Hill (2007). Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain. General Sources: S-A.
