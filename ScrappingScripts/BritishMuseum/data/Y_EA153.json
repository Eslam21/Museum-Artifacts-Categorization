{"artifact_name": "lintel", "Object Type": ["lintel"], "Museum number": ["EA153"], "Description": [" Sandstone lintel of Amenhotep I and Thutmose III: there are two distinct scenes carved in sunk relief on either side of this stone slab. On the left King Thutmose III is offering Maat to Amen-Re\u2018, Mut, Khons and Hathor who are enthroned behind an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by lotus flowers. On the right King Amenhotep I makes an offering of ointment jars to Amen-Re\u2018 (here depicted as having a ram's head), Khnum, Satet and Anuket who are all enthroned behind a similar altar. All texts are incised in columns above the heads of the figures. The stone is much worn on the surface and battered about the edges, with slight loss on the left side sustained in modern times. There are no traces of colour. The text on the left side has been restored.
