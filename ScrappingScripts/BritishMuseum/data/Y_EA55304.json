"], "Museum number": ["EA55304"], "Description": [" Plaster cast (modern) of a human face, taken from an ancient mould. The relaxed muscles and collapsed features have suggested that the subject was a dead person, and thus that the mould was intended for the productioin of a death-mask. The excavators of the mould assumed that the face was that of King Teti or his wife, since it was discovered at the pyramid-temple of Teti at Saqqara, and that the mask might have been used as a model for sculptors carving statues to be installed in the temple. This explanation is inconsistent with what is known of the production of statuary in ancient Egypt. The area of Teti's pyramid was used as a cemetery for private individuals in the Graeco-Roman period and it is possible that the mask dates to this period, when death masks were made to be carried in the funeral processions of Roman patrician families.
