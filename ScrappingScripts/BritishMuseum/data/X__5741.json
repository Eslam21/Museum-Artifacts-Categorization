", " Scarabs and scaraboids with a lion motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45, see especially no. 35 for this piece). This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A). Only scarabs are mentioned in Gorton typology for the specific motif displayed on this scaraboid (Gorton 1996, 95, subtype A73-88).
