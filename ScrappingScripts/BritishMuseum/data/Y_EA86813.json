{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86813"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows a convex surface, maybe from a leather bag. An impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.2 cm in the break. At the flat upper side about half of a seal-impression is preserved with few finger impressions around it. Visible is a fine circumferential line, the remains of a figure wearing an atef crown and two winged uraei in front and behind the figure in gesture of protection. Above them very small hieroglyphs. The rest is broken off. Same motif as EA86893, showing a king holding a flagellum and a HKA-sceptre, facing to the left, at the bottom before and behind him cartouches, the one behind him shows (Mn-[kheper]-R')|.
