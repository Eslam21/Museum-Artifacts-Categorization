Eight of them portray Senenmut with Princess Neferure, the daughter of Queen Hatshepsut. This statue shows the nobleman with the features of a young man: full cheeks in a smooth round face, wide-open eyes with long lashes executed in relief, large ears, and a small, straight, full mouth. As Senenmut was her tutor, the princess' head emerges from his mantle. An indication of her position as heiress to the throne, the child wears her hair in the pleated tress characteristic of royal children, ornamented with the uraeus. Her name, inscribed within a cartouche next to her head, is preceded by the title \"god's wife,\" most probably Amun-Re. This honorary and religious title began to be born by unmarried princesses from now on and was wide spread in the Late Period. The sides of the statue were ideal for a long text, listing Senenmut's numerous titles and functions in connection with the palace and with the cult of Amun"}
