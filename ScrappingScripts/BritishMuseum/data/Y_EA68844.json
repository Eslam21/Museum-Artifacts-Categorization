{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68844"], "Description": [" Fragmentary figure possibly depicting a sphinx or a siren, head now lost. The body of the figure is depicted in an upright frontal position, with two front legs discernible below modelled breasts which are uneven in both position and proportion. The belly is also uneven, with a clear difference in size between the left and right side of the figure. The front right leg is shown in advance of the left. The animal tail is shown on the lower right side of the figure as it curves around and upwards towards the right side of the torso. In addition to the break at the neck, there is also damage to the upper back. Though most of the original glaze is now lost, there are faint traces visible on the narrow oval base. There is also a faint tinge of green colour on the object, suggesting it had a brighter green hue in antiquity.

These were common during the Late Period and early Ptolemaic Period in Naukratis (Thomas 2019). Some objects may represent a \u2018Libyan\u2019 or \u2018Bastet\u2019 sphinx, representing Libyan influence on Egyptian sculpture of the 1st millennium BC (Gubel 1998: 632-645; Thomas 2015). Petrie dated these, with other limestone figures from Naukratis, between the 6th and 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886), though one example was found in a level dated to the Ptolemaic Period (ibid.). It has been noted that the animal may have had a seated human figure depicted on its shoulders on the reverse \u2013 the right foot and lower leg of the figure point forward, passing down along the shoulder and breast of the animal, and a short cloak is shown on the left side of the figure at the back. The provenance of this figure within Naukratis is uncertain. Further Bibliography: R.I. Thomas, 2015. \u2018Naukratis: Egyptian Late Period figures in terracotta and limestone\u2019, in A.
