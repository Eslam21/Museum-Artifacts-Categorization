Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, 28-32, see esp. no. 32 for this piece). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A49-72, especially A50 for this piece).
