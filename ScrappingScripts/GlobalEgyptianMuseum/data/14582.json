It is distinguished by its large size and its two front openings for the wicks, which allowed more light. It also has an opening in the middle through which it can be fiiled with oil. The large size was necessary to increase the amount of oil and thus increase the illumination; hence a handle was added at the rear to make the lamp easier to carry. The front part of the lamp is decorated with a mask of a face laughing in a comical manner."}
