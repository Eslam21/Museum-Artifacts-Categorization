{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2336"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone upper body of a male figure. He wears an intricate double-wig with traces of black paint. His thick eyebrows are carved in raised relief, and he has a thick upper eyelid extending into a wide cosmetic line at the outer corners. His nose is long and slim, and he has thick lips with the outer corners of his mouth slightly upturned suggesting a slight smile. There are traces of a white substance across the lower left side of the face and neck. The upper body is damaged at the neck and chest, and there are no indications of clothing or jewellery. On the reverse are the remains of a slim back-pillar, and though damaged it appears to be uninscribed. His head has been damaged at the top right side, above the forehead, and on the reverse. The tip of the nose has broken off and there are numerous chips to the rest of the stone surface, including gouges to the lower part of the back-pillar.
