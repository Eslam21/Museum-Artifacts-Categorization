{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68822"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone figure of a horse with rider, possibly representing the god Harpocrates. The surviving main body of the horse has little definition or indication of features, with the front legs, lower body and hind legs are now missing. The rider figure sits low on the raised neck of the horse and is comparatively smaller in size, which may suggest that this represents a child figure or deity. The rider\u2019s bent legs, arms and body are crudely sculpted, and the head and upper body is now lost. Faint traces of a red-brown paint are visible across the body of the horse and the rider, and traces of a brown-black paint are also visible on the left side of the object. On the belly of the horse at the left side is a modern inventory number from the Naukratis excavation. In addition to the breaks across the object noted above, there are several chips and scratches across the surface of the horse\u2019s body.

Many more are also held in various other museum collections, including: Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t (Heidelberg, ST48); Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire (Brussels, A.1850); Egyptian Museum (Cairo, JE36257, JE33573.2); Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, AN1896-1908-G.1013, AN1896-1908-G.1007, AN1896-1908-G.109, AN1896-1908-G.1041, AN1896-1908-G.1040, AN1896-1908-G.1039); Bolton Museum (Bolton,1966.90.A); Fitzwilliam Museum (Cambridge MCA NA 306). Variants of these figures were also found at Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum Oxford, AN1896- 1908-G.1027; British Museum London, 1886,0401.1493, 1965,0930.952, 1965,0930.949). Based on other distinctive features these have been argued to represent Harpocrates; however, this British Museum figure is too fragmentary and crudely carved to definitively identity the deity. Late variants of this god are also sometimes depicted as ithyphallic, consistent with the representation of Harpocrates of the 4th century BC (Thomas 2019). Petrie dated most of these pieces to the 6th to 4th BC. Parallels of this rider figure are known from Buto (Egyptian Museum, Cairo TR14/1/34/8), Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888: 71; Hogarth 1905: 129, the former dating these to the 7th century BC and the latter to the 6th century BC), and Saqqara (Quibell 1907: 13). Four examples, including two with Greek dedications (possibly dated c. 450BC - 350BC), were found next to the Hellenion in untouched earth containing 'early Naukratite pottery' (Edgar in Hogarth et al. 1905: 30, 39, 55, Pl.14.10 and 11, wall [35]). Other artefacts from these earliest deposits include Late Archaic, but mostly Classical period pottery and terracottas of the end of the 6th and the 5th centuries BC. Two examples were found in a Well deposit of the 5th century BC (Hogarth 1905), and another with a 5th century BC bronzes hoard in Petrie\u2019s so called \u2018Ptolemaic building\u2019 at the south of the town (Petrie 1886: Pl.19.5).
