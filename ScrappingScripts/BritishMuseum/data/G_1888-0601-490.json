The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds. The presence of filling ornament also suggests that the vases were mostly likely the earliest in the Grand Style. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. Finally, there is a clumsy attempt at creating some perspective. However, that there is no evidence for filling ornament on this sherd, nor is there any evidence for any attempt at perspective. Yet the depiction of male figures in this group is done in outline, as the male figure appears here. In later Grand Style vases, male figures are depicted with coloured flesh. The number 817 (?) is written in pencil on the interior."], "Bibliographic references": [" Price 1924 / Pottery of Naukratis (pl. V, no. 4) ", " Walter-Karydi 1973 / Samische Gef\u00e4sse des 6.
