{"artifact_name": "vessel-stamp", "Object Type": ["vessel-stamp"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1367"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta stamp, for bread or plaster seals. Circular, with part of the edge lost, and an applied rectangular grip on the centre back. It has an incuse pattern: within a simple guilloche on the edge, is a basket of fruit, including two bunches of grapes, a pomegranate, a row of berries, and tapering curved pine cones. On each side of the basket is a wine-amphora, probably of pre-Roman type. Pressed over a plaster form. Traces of white residue, possibly plaster on front of stamp, over traces of thin red slip. Red-brown Nile silt (coarse) with a brown core and abundant gold mica and rare white grits.

The presence of plaster residue casts doubt on this being a cake stamp, instead suggesting this may be for plaster seals, possibly for sealing wine amphorae, supported by the subject of the stamp: grapes and amphorae. As Roman amphora stoppers were stamped with names, whilst Ptolemaic amphora handles were stamped, Bailey's Ptolemaic date seems likely (2008: 90). Amphora stopper stamp. Such objects are commonly described as cake or bread stamps (Petrie 1886; Bailey 2008). However, such an interpretation is called into question by the presence of plaster in the grooves of many examples found at Naukratis, as if used to stamp the seals of amphora stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). This is confirmed by the presence of a stamp from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. xxix; Bolton Museum 1886.31.35) used to stamp a design on a terracotta disc stopper from the same site (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964) and not bread or cake.
