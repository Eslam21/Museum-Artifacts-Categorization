He was the god of the dead and chief judge of the court of justice in the underworld. Osiris was also the god who was at the disposal of all people, to whom they were directed for help during life, and after death. His main cult center was at Abydos in Upper Egypt, where people would make pilgrimage, personally when alive, or through their statues or stelae after death. Scenes of the pilgrimage with the boats were depicted on the walls of their tombs. In Abydos, pious people hoped to participate in enjoying the offerings at the table of Osiris and thus secure eternal life. Osiris was also worshipped, not only in the cemeteries, but also in important cities, such as Busiris, Karnak, and Heliopolis.This is a fine standing statue of the god Osiris who is shown wrapped in a long, fitted garment and wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt and the sacred false beard. His crossed arms hold the usual two sacred insignia; the crook and the flail, symbols of the ruler and dignity respectively"}
