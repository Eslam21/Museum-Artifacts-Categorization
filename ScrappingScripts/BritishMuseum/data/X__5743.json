This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Scarabs and scaraboids with a winged sphinx motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). A number of different versions are illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 28-30 and Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 62. This type was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A108-113, see especially A109 for this piece). Gordon misidentified this scaraboid with Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 25, but the latter depicts a walking winged lion and corresponds to BM 1886,0401.1616.
