{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1904:567", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-BAHNASA", "Category": "PEN", "Material": "REED", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Reed pen with cut nib", "Description": "Whereas the Egyptian scribe had traditionally used a reed pen with crushed nib, similar to a brush, the pen used for writing Greek had a cut nib, giving sharper and more angular signs, more suitable to the Greek and Latin alphabets than to the Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic and Demotic scripts. The ink used was also different, the Egyptians using carbon black, the Greeks using lead inks. Eventually Greek pens and ink replaced the Egyptian types. This example is from the large provincial town at Oxyrhynchus, from which the greatest number of Roman Period papyri have been retrieved."}
