According to Gorton, this type of scarab was probably not produced in Naukratis as it appears in an early 7th century BC context (tomb 16 from Carthage, Dermech: see Vercoutter 1945, no. 379), before the production of the Scarab Factory (Gorton 1996, 80). The treatment of the back however could be related to another Egyptian blue scarab produced in Naukratis, Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.6.
