During the course of the 4th century BC arrow heads tended to become larger, when this short type was abandoned. Parallels from Olympia, Marathon and Paphos are tentatively given a Classical date of 5th century BC (Baitinger 2001, 25, fig. 371-2 Dreikantige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIC). This type is cited as evidence by Snodgrass of Persian archers at the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae and subsequently adopted in Greece, though this type is dated elsewhere from the 7th century BC onwards (Snodgrass 1964, 154 small \u2018Scythian\u2019, \u2018pyramidal\u2019 socketed bronze Form 3C3; 1967, 99; Erdmann 1973, 45 \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Form CIIc2 dated to 7th or 6th to 4th centuries BC). Parallels from Tell Dafana and the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.6, 44 dated to late 7th to 6th centuries BC).
