{"artifact_name": "column", "Object Type": ["column"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.28"], "Description": [" Fragment of limestone column-necking decorated with lotus moulding. This fragment only shows the edge of clynical flowers of a lotus and a bud. The flower's blossom is slightly slimmer and is more widely swung that that of B394a, yet the two may still belong to the same column. The limestone is light coloured and fine-grained. Traces of red paint.

This fragment and B394a differ in their execution but may well belong to different columns within the same group of columns. The design of the lotus-blossom sepal slightly differs from B394a as it has slimmer petals and is wider swung than the latter (Koenigs 2007, 315-316). Published (Koenigs 2007, 315f.
