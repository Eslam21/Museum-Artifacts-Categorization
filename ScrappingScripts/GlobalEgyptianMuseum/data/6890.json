Inside, the burnish created heavy horizontal marks, which is not the case on the outside. Additionally, red-coloured horizontal brush strokes were applied to the outside. The lip shows a rather wide \"dents de loup\" design (\"wolf's teeth\" motif). The gloss of the burnish has almost entirely disappeared."}
