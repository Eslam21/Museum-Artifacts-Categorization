Egyptians, therefore, wanted to ward off the danger from crocodiles. They built temples for the cult of the crocodile god Sobek at Esna, Kom Ombo, the Faiyum region, and other places. Each temple had a pool or small underground chambers, in which a live crocodile was kept to receive the offerings and prayers. Sobek was associated with the sun god Re. In the Book of the Dead, spells were compiled for the deceased person \"for driving off the crocodile that comes to take away the deceased's magic from him in the realm of the dead\" (spell 31).This statue was placed in one of the god's temples by a pious worshipper. It was easy to pray and place offerings in front of the statue. The figure, together with the base, was cut from a single block. The mouth is closed, and the details of the body were carved in relief, crossed and striped. Few details, however, can be seen on the figure."}
