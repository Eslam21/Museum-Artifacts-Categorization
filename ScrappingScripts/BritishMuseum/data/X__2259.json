", " Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Though not listed in Gorton typology, this scarab could pertain to her type XXXVI (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI, subtype 27-28), or more likely to her larger widespread type XXVIII B. The hieroglyphic inscription on its underside does not seem to make sense. The hieroglyphs could be used here for their magical value, as suggested by Gorton for most of Naukratis scarabs (Gorton 1996, 93). Another possible interpretation would be to see a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). Close to the hieroglyphic signs on the scaraboid BM 1886,0401.1634 (published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 52).
