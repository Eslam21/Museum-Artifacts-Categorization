It is a typical example of his later engravings, when he produced smaller, less ambitiously conceived compositions with an emphasis on grey and silver tonal values which are delicately expressed here in the city buildings. Meder referred to an impression of this engraving printed in red (see Schoch, p. 22) which is a typical product of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, when late impressions of D\u00fcrer prints were printed in colour, or elaborately coloured by hand to improve the appearance of a worn plate or block. At a later date again, St Antony the Hermit inspired the production of a brown ink and wash drawing in the British Museum in which the city view is copied, 'View of a Town on a Promontory' ( inv.no 1860,0616. 87). During the mid-nineteenth century, this drawing was considered to be one of Rembrandt's finest landscapes. The attribution was questioned by the end of the century when the connection with D\u00fcrer's print was made and the drawing is now thought to be possibly by a member of Rembrandt's school' ."], "Bibliographic references": [" Meder 1932 / D\u00fcrer Katalog (51) ", " Bartsch / Le Peintre graveur (VII.74.58) ", " Dodgson 1926 / Albrecht D\u00fcrer (91) ", " Schoch 2001-04 / Albrecht D\u00fcrer, das druckgraphische Werk. 3 vols I Intaglio, II Woodcuts, III Book illustrations (I.87) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 1971 BM, D\u00fcrer, no. 248 1995 Jun-Oct, BM, 'German Renaissance Prints, 1490-1550', no.42 1996 Jun-Aug, Canterbury, Royal Mus and AG, Germ.
