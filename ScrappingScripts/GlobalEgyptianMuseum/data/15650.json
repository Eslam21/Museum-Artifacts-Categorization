The artist had begun to carve the lower part of the body and the cushion on which the princess is sitting. This model is an extraordinary artist's study that shows the technical skill and creativity of the Egyptian artist during the Amarna period. This example represents a break from long-established tradition through the depiction of the moments before, during, or after a meal."}
