Such \u2018Asiatic\u2019 looking male figurines date to between the mid 7th to late 6th centuries BC, with very close parallels from Cyprus, probably from Arsos workshops (Karageorghis 1995, 19-21, Type I(ii) 38. pl. 9.3). Karageorghis argues the \u2018Assyrian\u2019 look may coincide with Assyrian domination of Cyprus during the seventh century BC (1995, 21).

This figurine is labelled in pencil TA\u03a615 (although the characters are worn, they are clear), designating this as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886.
