Curving ribbons hang down from the belt on either side of the apron. His head is covered by a wig with a gilded band around it and a broad sidelock hangs down from his head as far as the upper arm. The object the prince held against his chest with one or even both hands can't be ascertained owing to the fragmentary nature of the piece. The statuette was fitted into the pedestal at a later date, because the four lines of inscription on it mention the title and name of Queen Tiy. Around the pedestal is a decoration of alternating ankh, djed, and was signs."}
