The circles are evenly distributed on the surface of the comb, so there is one circle in each corner of the comb and the fifth circle is in the center. Between the circles and the four corners is an ornament composed of nine small raised circles forming a rhombus shape. On both sides of the comb, a frame is decorated with a high-relief. The ornaments on the frame match the size of the teeth of the comb on both sides. There are nine wide teeth on one side of the comb, with the central ones broken, and approximately 35 whole teeth on the other side with very little space between them"}
