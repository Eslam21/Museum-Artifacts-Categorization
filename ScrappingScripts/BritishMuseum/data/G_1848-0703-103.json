{"artifact_name": "shield; model", "Object Type": [" shield ", " model "], "Museum number": ["1843,0507.1039"], "Description": [" Terracotta model of a shield, with relief of a soldier. A model rectangular shield, divided into two by a vertical spine extending up and down from a central knobbed boss; there is a simple moulding at top and bottom, and a substantial vertical handle is applied to the rear. One side is largely lost, with only a 'ghost' of a foot remaining, perhaps of Nepthys; on the surviving side is a relief of Antaios, god of the Antaiopolite Nome, the Tenth Upper Egyptian Nome, standing frontally (except for his feet) in military garb, with a cuirass over a shortsleeved tunic, and with pteryges protecting his thighs; a knotted cingulum encircles his waist. He is bearded and wears a fillet, the ties of which fall on his shoulders, holding an indistinct feather (probably two feathers). He threatens with a sword a diminutive captive held, almost hanging, by a rope in his left hand. The captive has a headdress adorned with antelope's horns and holds a double-axe. The lost figure facing Antaios may be his consort Nephthys. A fragment is broken away from below the relief and is restored in plaster. One-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with white and dark inclusions; traces of a white dressing.
