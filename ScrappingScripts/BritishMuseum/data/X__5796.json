", " In addition to glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids, the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 at Naukratis was also producing amulets (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming; see also Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Petrie listed a number of amulet-moulds including a similar type of this piece (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 16). Several similar moulds used to produced wedjat-eye in bulla form were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1920,0417.6, BM 1920,0417.7, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45969 and Oxford Ashmolean Museum AN1888.216.10. This example was discovered along with several moulds during Hogarth's excavation in 1903. According to Hogarth's list of antiquities from that year (list of Box 1), it came from the Hellenion area. Hogarth actually referred to North East town, including the Hellenion and an industrial area to the East. Could that be evidence for a second workshop in that area? These moulds do not differ from the ones discovered in the Scarab Factory area. Gorton, A.
