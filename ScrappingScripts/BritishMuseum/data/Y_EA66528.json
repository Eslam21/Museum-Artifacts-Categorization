Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45 and 146 for this example). This lion displays an hellenizing style (elongated body and elegant shape). The scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in Sardinia, south Italy, Carthage, Perachora and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 127-128, type XXXV, subtype 1-7, see especially 5 for this piece).
