The break occurs below the breasts. The back of the statue has been broken off below the head and thus the shoulders and arms are also missing. The nose is broken off and the mouth, eyes and chin are very worn. The facial features are characteristic of the style of the 4th century BC, which was common into the reign of Ptolemy II. The material used also supports this date."}
