{"artifact_name": "vessel-stamp", "Object Type": ["vessel-stamp"], "Museum number": ["1965,0930.896"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta stamp fragment. A fragment of a large circular bread-stamp (?) with an applied oval-sectioned, but much damaged, grip on the centre back. The pattern is largely incuse, but with some relief detail: within an inward facing egg-and-dart border is a frontal bull\u2019s head, with ribbons and tassels depending on each side. The ribbon on the proper right side of the stamp supports a pendent shrine-shaped amulet with two uraeus cornices: part of the amulet is interrupted by an ovolo. Face covered with a good quality red slip, with runs on the back. Pressed over a plaster form, with traces of this plaster in the mould. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica and few white grits. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": ["2ndC BC-1stC BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Naukratis (?)

The presence of plaster in the mould casts some doubt on the identification of this as a bread-mould, though this could also be post depositional as some traces of plaster also on break. Similar Greco-roman stamps have been published (Galavaris 1970: 2, fig. 7; Kater-Sibbes and Vermaseren 1975: no. 48; Pagenstecher 1913: pl. L: 7). Amphora stopper stamp. Such objects are commonly described as cake or bread stamps (Petrie 1886; Bailey 2008). However, such an interpretation is called into question by the presence of plaster in the grooves of many examples found at Naukratis, as if used to stamp the seals of amphora stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). This is confirmed by the presence of a stamp from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. xxix; Bolton Museum 1886.31.35) used to stamp a design on a terracotta disc stopper from the same site (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964) and not bread or cake. A number of such terracotta and stone stamps (Alexandria, Greco-Roman Museum 9710; British Museum GR 1888,0601.157, GR 1886,0401.1768, 1886,0401.1367, 1888,0601.156, 1886,0401.1370, 1886,0401.1369, 1965,0930.896, 1965,0930.895; Bolton Museum 1966.94.A, 1886.31.35; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.87.298, 88.912, 88.914, 88.916, 88.917, 88.913, 88.911, 86.667, 86.666, 88.915, 86.665, 86.664, 86.663; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum, H2241; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, GR.46.1887, GR.45.1887, GR.44.1887, GR.43.1887, GR.42.1887, GR.41.1887; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA732; NA731, NA730, NA729, NA728, NA727, NA726, NA725, NA724; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,57, 9,9,86,56; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4568, AN1886.517, AN1886.516, AN1886.515, AN1886.514, AN1886.513, AN1886.512) and the stoppers produced by them (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964; Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). are known from Naukratis.
