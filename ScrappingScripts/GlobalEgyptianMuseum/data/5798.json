{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "9029", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FISH MUMMY", "Material": "LINEN", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED", "Name": "Fish mummy", "Description": "Mummy in the shape of a fish, wrapped in linen bandages. The eyes are black painted circles and ring-shaped traces indicate the gills and the beginning of the tail. An X-ray examination of the mummy would be needed in order to determine its contents; from the outside appearance alone it is impossible to tell what kind of fish it is. Experience with other animal mummies, however, has shown that it is not even certain if we are dealing with a mummy of a fish or with that of another animal."}
