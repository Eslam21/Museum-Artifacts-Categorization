{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA69519"], "Description": [" Fragmentary granite head of a female figure, the body and base of the figure now missing. The figure wears a striated wig which is tucked behind the ears and now broken off at the neck level on either side. The eyes are slanted and almond shaped with a heavy eyelid. The nose is long and broad, and almost the same width as the mouth. The lower lip is sharply incised along the edge and slightly thicker in size than the upper lip. The outer corners of the mouth appear slightly downturned, creating a serious facial expression. The face is rounded and particularly fleshy around the jawline area. On the reverse are the remains of a raised area at in the centre of the wig. In addition to the break at the neck level and damage to the wig on either side, there are small chips to the stone surface at the ears, face, and wig.
