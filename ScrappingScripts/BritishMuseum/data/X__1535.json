{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Fragment of a statuette of a kitharode. Man, playing kithara, upper part only. Compact white Egyptian limestone. The musician holds his instrument against his left shoulder, grasping it with his left hand while he plucks the strings with his right. The whole figure missing from the waist down; also the left fore-arm with much of the kithara, the right shoulder and right upper arm. Chips missing from nose and hair to either side of head. Traces of black on the hair and the right eye; faint traces of red and black on the kithara. The instrument itself seems definitely to be flat at the bottom and square in its lower section and so to be a kithara rather than the lyre more usually held by statuettes in the 'mixed style'.

", " Female musician, usually naked, other than a wig, playing a drum/tambour or a lyre/harp were relatively common at Naukratis. These were crudely carved from soft limestone, with traces of red and black paint, though variations exist in the style and the instrument depicted. The earliest variants, flat drum or tambour player figures, were the most common at Naukratis (Hogarth 1899, pl.14.6; Hogarth et al. 1905, 130, pl.14.6; Petrie 1886, 40; British Museum 1965,0930.930; Oxford AN1886.543; Boston 86.162), with rare slightly finer variant (Boston 86.163). A number of drummers were found at the Naukratis Scarab Factory, in a stratum dated by Petrie to 580 BC (Petrie 1886, 40, Level 335). Musicians playing harps follow the same style, but are less common at Naukratis (Oxford AN1896-1908-G.71, and possibly Cambridge GR.3.1887). Presumably later, more three dimensional, lyre players were also rare (Oxford AN1922.212). Close Late Period parallels were found at Kom Firin (Petrie Museum UC16473; N.Spencer 2013, F343) and late 6th or early 5th century BC Sais (Daressy 1901, 230-239; Cairo JE 90239, exc. no.78; JE 90240, exc. no.79; JE 90241, exc. no. 80; JE90251, exc. no. 149) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC4530; UC4530 with flute; see also UC8575 \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019; UC33273, Petrie 1927, 58 pl.50.312). These musical instruments were used during inundation and other religious festivals of Egypt (Pinch 1993; Manniche 1991; Barrett 2011). Most are Saite in date, but three-dimensional and more life-like variants continue into the Persian Period. Late 7th to 6th century BC, with later variants continue into the 5th century BC.

", " These latter, if we may include part-human instrumentalists as well, begin before the end of the seventh century B.C. and extend well down into the sixth century. I With the later examples of these the Fitzwilliam kitharode shows defInite affinities in pose and treatment. However, the coarse rendering of his face and hair is quite foreign to the' mixed style', but can be paralleled amongst a class of crude limestone plaques at Naukratis oflocal Egyptian workmanship; these had apparently already begun to be produced in the sixth century B.C., although they seem also to have continued in vogue in classical times. The Fitzwilliam fragment presumably dates before the end of the 'mixed style'. Local Egyptian version of a Greco-Cypriot motif of the sixth century B.C.
