{"artifact_name": "jar", "Object Type": ["jar"], "Museum number": ["EA37603"], "Description": [" A terracotta flask in the form of a female sphinx of Greek type, modelled in the round. She is semi-couchant, the lion body resting on a plinth, the rear right leg shown in full, with the underside of the left rear paw showing on the same side in an Egyptian fashion, the left haunch without the lower leg indicated at the back of the vessel. Her left front paw rests on her right paw, again an Egyptian characteristic. The human bust, which is naked, is half turned to the front, the head completely so. The hair stands up, framing the face, with a roll at the back, from which heavy locks fall down her upper back. She wears a body-chain with a square junction-piece: it is not indicated at the rear. The handle is formed by her wings, arching from the back of her head to reach the top of her haunches. A short, slightly expanding vessel mouth rises from her head. The plinth is rectangular, with a panelled front and back; the front panel has a short wreath with leaves and fruits, perhaps an olive; the back has simple tendrils. Two-piece mould. Orange-brown marl fabric, covered, except underneath, with a worn brown to black slip.
