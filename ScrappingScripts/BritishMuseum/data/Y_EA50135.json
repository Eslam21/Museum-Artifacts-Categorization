They are dated to between the mid 7th and early 6th centuries BC and found in Samos, Rhodes and Crete (Karageorghis 1999, 130-5). Gjerstad sites similar forms as parallels for his Eastern Neo-Cypriot style, that he dates between 570 and 520 BC (Gjerstad 1948, 105-7, pl. 7), though the hair appears to be influenced by Egyptian art.
