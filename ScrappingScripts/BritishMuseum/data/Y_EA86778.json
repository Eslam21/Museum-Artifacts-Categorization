{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86778"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. It also shows blackened parts probably from fire. The rear shows a slightly concave area with the impression of wood, probably from a bolt or a box knob, perpendicular to this two impressions of a turned cord with a width of approximately 0.20 cm. The front side is flat which ends in a convex edge. It shows probably an impression of a seal that was impressed twice or maybe three times, with each later impression mostly overlapping the earlier impression. The shape is oval of a scarab-like seal. The motif shows a circumferential line and a standing baboon at the left, facing to the right with raised arms in front of another sign that looks like Ax.t (N27). Both are positioned on top of a simple bark. Underneath an unidentifiable sign, maybe just a decorative band.
