Some are on long loop-in-loop gold chains, but this one is on gold wire and it bears the royal name.To the Egyptians the heart was the most essential organ, not because it pumped blood around the body but because they believed it was the seat of intelligence, the originator of feelings and the storehouse of memory. This amulet is considered to be an amulet of assimilation, so it gives the wearer all the attributes of this organ, such as intelligence. Alone among the internal organs removed from the body during mummification, the heart was left in place in the body cavity, to be weighed in the balance of justice in the underworld."}
