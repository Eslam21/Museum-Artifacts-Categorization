{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA22914"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Ankhefenkhons: there are three separate sections on this round-topped stela. In the upper part is a winged sun-disk with uraei under a curved sky-sign filled with stars. The middle part of the stela is surrounded by a multi-coloured border. Two scenes are depicted under a starry sky-sign. On the left the prophet of Montu Ankhefenkhons, wearing a leopard-skin over his linen robe, stands in adoration of the god Ra-Horakhty, who stands behind an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus flower. A similar scene on the right depicts the deceased in worship of Atum. The lower part of the stela consists of ten lines of text which are divided vertically in the middle into two separate prayers on behalf of the prophet of Montu Ankhefenkhons, son of Bs-n-Mwt, son of... The right hand side of the stela, which was formed of a separate piece of wood joined by dowels, has been lost. The surviving part of the stela is well preserved apart from several cracks and gouges and some loss along the right side. The sky-sign at the top of the stela is white with red stars. The disk is red and the wings and uraei are buff-white with black details. The background of the upper section is light green. The middle scene is surrounded by a multi-coloured border of blue, orange, green, and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes, all edged in green. The sky and its continuing border are white with red stars. The figures and objects are white with black details, and the hieroglyphs are black on white. The background of the middle scene is blue which has been applied around the figures to create an impression of sunk relief. The texts at the bottom are black on white between blue lines. There is another multi-coloured border at the bottom. The sides and back have been plastered.
