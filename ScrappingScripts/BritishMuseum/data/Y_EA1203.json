{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1203"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Intef, son of Ka: Intef is shown standing, receiving an offering from a small male figure who stands in front of him; the positioning of this figure and the scale are very characteristic of the First Intermediate Period. Behind Intef are three female figures, all referred to as his wives, named Mery, Iutu, and Iru. The principal text of the stela, which runs horizontally at the top and then continues vertically at the right side and then in front of the lower parts of the principal figures, is a mixture of offering formulas, important historical information, and phrases that form parts of standard idealized biographical texts.
