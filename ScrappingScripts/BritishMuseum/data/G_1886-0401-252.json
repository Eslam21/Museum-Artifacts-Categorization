The lack of a rim prevents the confirmation of the cup shape. Type 10 cups were mass produced and include numerous variants. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type V (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B1 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Numerous Type 10 South Ionian cups have been found at Naukratis, as well as in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra and at Megara Hyblaea on Sicily, and at Berezan on the Black Sea (Posamentir 2006, 165). The place of production of the vase was determined as probably Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.1025) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric. Type 9 cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups and have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. Type 9 cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis. Part I., 1884-85 (pl.
