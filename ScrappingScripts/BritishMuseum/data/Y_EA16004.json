{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA16004"], "Description": [" Head of a limestone male figure, roughly broken at the neck. He wears a heavy wig with detailed individual tresses of hair, including tighter curls of hair above the forehead and along the edges of the wig. There are surviving traces of black paint particularly at the lower left and right side of the wig. Red-brown paint has been applied to his face and neck to indicate his skin. His eyebrows are thick and arched, sloping down towards the temple. His eyes have a thick cosmetic line emerging from the outer corners, and the nose is short and broad at the tip. His mouth is small and his lips are pursed together, and the outer corners of the mouth are flat. His jawline is particularly rounded and fleshy. There are small chips at the tip of the nose and lower left side of the face. The object is now attached to a small modern base.

While the fragmentary nature of the figure makes it difficult to determine his original pose and further physical features, the red-brown colour across the surviving part of his shoulder area may suggest this his upper body was originally bare. The provenance of the figure is recorded as Saqqara. Figures of the elite were typically placed in tomb contexts during the 18th Dynasty."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["incomplete - head only"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Rev Greville John Chester"], "Acquisition date": ["1885"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA16004"], "Registration number": ["1885,0723.92"]}
