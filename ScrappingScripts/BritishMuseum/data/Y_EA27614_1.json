Falcon bronzes are usually associated with Horus (Weiss 2012, 281-282), though several deities and the pharaoh himself are linked with this form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54). This element could belong to either types T18 or T19 depending if the falcon was crowned or not (Weiss 2012, 738-745, Taf. 43c-f and 44, Typ T18-19, see Nr. 1413 for this specimen). Such bronze figures are well documented in the Memphite region, particularly in the falcon complex and catacomb in North Saqqara (Davies, Smith 2005). A few more specimens were found in Herakleion and Athribis. Numerous falcon figures, mainly amuletic figures made out of copper alloy, but also glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis, including rather large amuletic figures in glazed composition likely produced locally (Masson forthcoming).
