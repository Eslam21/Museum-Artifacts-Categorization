The break occurs just below the diadem.This combination of elements is known for queens from the late 18th Dynasty onwards, and for God's Wives in the Late Period. The dating to the Ramesside Period (thereby opting for the head-dress of a queen) is mainly based on the size of the statue, which would be unusual for the Late Period."}
