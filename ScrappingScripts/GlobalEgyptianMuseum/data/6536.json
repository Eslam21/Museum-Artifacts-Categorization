The neck is decorated with vertical lines separated by a group of three horizontal lines, the pattern being reminiscent of a bunch of plants.  A figurine, most probably a little monkey, served as a handle and was leaning against these plants. Damaged on its upper portion, its counterpart on the other side of the neck has entirely disappeared although its former position is still visible."}
