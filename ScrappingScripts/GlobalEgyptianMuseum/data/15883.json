Nevertheless, the mummy later found its way to the royal cache at Deir el-Bahari. The king's face was painted in red and his nostrils were filled with wax. The mummy shows evidence of smallpox; the neck, chest and face were covered with raised nodules. The whole mummy was filled with sawdust, including part of his internal organs."}
