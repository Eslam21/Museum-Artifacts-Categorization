Beneath the Bible lie the dismantled scales of justice. Above, an arm and the shield of Britannia emerge from dark clouds; in the hand is a sheaf of thunderbolts which smites the Colossus, striking off its head, a skull in which serpents twine; from this drops a bonnet-rouge in the form of a fool's cap. The arms and legs of the Colossus have also been broken, so that the figure is on the point of collapse. The severed right hand rests on a guillotine, inscribed 'Fraternit\u00e9'. The decollated head of Louis XVI [see BMSat 8297, &c] hangs by the hair from the figure's neck. From the left hand drops an open book: 'Religion de la Nature [cf. BMSats 8350, 9240] Injustice Oppression Murder Destruction'. The figure wears only a tricolour sash and belt in which are a pistol and a bloody dagger. Its hands and feet are dyed with blood above the wrists and ankles. Tricolour flags inscribed with names decorate the landscape, showing the extent of French depredations: 'Malta' in the channel immediately under the Colossus; 'Spain' (left) behind 'France'; 'Holland', with windmills; 'Switzerland' backed by rocky mountains; 'Rome' with the dome of St. Peter's. Beneath the title: \"Shall the Works of a wicked Nation remain? - shall the Monuments of Oppression not be destroyed? - shall the \\ \"Light'ning not blast the Image, which the Destroyers have set up against the God of Heaven, & against his Laws?\" Tertullian.'
