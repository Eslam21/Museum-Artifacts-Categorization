The two adjoining fragments show two smooth ropes of differing thickness (2.00 \u2013 2.3 cm) that are entwined to a herculean knot on the rim of a presumably deep bowl. An even surface is preserved on the narrow edge of the fragment which could possibly have been the upper or under layer of the relief or vertical adjoining area. The light grey marble is broken off on all sides.
