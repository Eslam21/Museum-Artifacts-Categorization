The head is covered with a red painted headdress, leaving the ears and the wavy locks on the forehead free. The wig is parted in the middle. The eyebrows and nose are straight, the eyes are wide open, the mouth is small. The eyes are inlaid with glas and have bronze lashes.The earrings seem to merge with the wig-like lappets of the chest piece, beginning with three rows of beads. The three registers of the lappets bear identical scenes, mirroring each other and separated by three horizontal lines. The upper register shows Wadjet as a uraeus with a sun disk, protectingly spreading out her wings; in the middle registers the ibis-headed Thoth is seated with the moon on his head; and the lower register shows Re-Harakhty as a reclining falcon-headed sphinx, with one front paw raised and protected by the vulture goddess Nekhbet.The lappets are separated by an elaborate necklace with a lunula pendant on top and under it several rows of varying beads."}
