{"artifact_name": "coffin", "Object Type": ["coffin"], "Museum number": ["EA30360"], "Description": [" Proper left side of the wooden outer anthropoid coffin of Tanetaa: inscriptions and images are painted on a plastered linen ground, over the wooden structure. Exterior: an ornamental kheker-frieze runs along the top edge. Below this are images and texts between coloured block-borders. At the head-end, partially broken away, is a trace of a scene in which a deity performed libations to purify Tanetaa. To the left of this is an inscription in twenty-eight vertical lines, reading from right to left. At the left-hand end of the text is a standing figure of the god Horus. Interior: a single right-facing vertical line of polychrome hieroglyphs between linear borders. At the top is a portion of a figured scene, at right angles to the main text. This scene occupied the curved canopy of the coffin head. The surviving section shows two of the Sons of Horus beneath the hieroglyphic sign for 'sky'.
