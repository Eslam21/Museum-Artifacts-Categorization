{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA86131"], "Description": [" Small axe head made of dark grey basalt, roughly rectangular in shape with one side forming the rounded blade with a sharp and well defined edge. It is tapered toward the butt with two small protruding lugs onto which the handle was attached. Traces of wear. The surface is roughly pitted at the butt end and very well smoothed at the blade end. Rubbing from the binding resulted in polished surface parts at the underside of the protruding lugs as well as at the edge of the butt end.
