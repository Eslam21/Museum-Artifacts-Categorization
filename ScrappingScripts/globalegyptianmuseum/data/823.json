It is a very original piece: the use of alabaster, which gives a soapy and unfinished appearance, is exceptional. Nakhti is seated on a cube-shaped seat, and rests his left hand on his left knee, while his right fist is clenched on his right knee. The hands and feet are very large in relation to the rest of his body, and the use of black paint for the eyes and eyebrows gives the face a very expressive appearance. Even if the statuette does give the impression of imperfection of form, it does express the imperturbable strength of a provincial noble living at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom."}
