{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74717"], "Description": [" Portrait of a woman in encaustic on fir, with added gilding: the panel is cracked vertically to the right of the centre through to the subject's brow. Much of the surface is lost or altered through melting of the original wax. A thick coat of paraffin wax has been applied. The panel is not cut down at the upper corners. The background to the portrait, in lead white, appears as a rectangle within black borders. The subject is shown in frontal pose, dressed in a pinkish-red tunic with orange-gold clavi. She wears no mantle. Madder mixed with a little Egyptian blue was used for the robe; the clavi were painted with Egyptian blue and ochre. The jewellery is added in gold leaf: trident earrings with pendant pearls painted in white; a necklace composed of long gold strips set vertically, and a herringbone chain with a pendant stone (perhaps a garnet or amethyst) in a gold setting. In the hair is a triple gold wreath of lozenges and triangles, some detached from their original setting, and a central circular element. The proper left eye is large and almond-shaped with a squarish brown pupil. The eyebrows are arched. The proper right eye and much of the nose are severely damaged. The thin dark red lips are covered in gold leaf. A central parting is clearly visible in the hair, which appears to be cut close to the head.
