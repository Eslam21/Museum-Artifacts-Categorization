The name Shawabti comes from the verb wesheb meaning \"to answer\", as they had to obey all the orders given to them. These shawabties in their wooden box were made of faience. They are wearing the long tripartite wig, and their arms are crossed on their chests. The small shawabties are called frits; they were mass-produced without attention to detail."}
