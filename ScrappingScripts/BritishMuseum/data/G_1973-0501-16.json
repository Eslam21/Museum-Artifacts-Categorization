{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.16"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of ithyphallic Harpokrates enthroned. A seated deity, probably Harpokrates, modelled in the round: the narrow support on which he sits, and his legs from the knees down, are broken away, as also is his head. Mould-made? A very large phallus lies between his thighs. His right hand, which is lost, is raised, and his left, clenched into a fist, rests on his thigh. He is clothed in a garment that leaves his right shoulder free and extends to the break in his legs, and probably further when the figure was complete. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a thick grey core, with some white inclusions. The flesh is painted red and his garment is laid on in a thick white dressing. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?)

This type was originally produced during the Late Period as a solid figure (British Museum GR 1973,0501.16 and in stone GR2011,5011.15; Cambridge Fitzwilliam, E.81.1914, Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA596) and was subsequently made hollow in the 3rd century BC like other Ptolemaic figures (Bolton Museum 1886.31.23; British Museum GR 1973,0501.56; GR1973,0501.10; GR1973,0501.74). These parallels come from Naukratis, the most likely find spot and production place for these objects, based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% are from Naukratis). Parallels from the Egypt Exploration Fund\u2019s work at Naukratis (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.81.1914). Eroneously attributed previously to Antinoopolis. Parallel (later type?) from 3rd century BC Ras el Soda, Alexandria (Himmelmann 1983, 47, 59, pl.23a; Adriani 1952).
