{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA87246"], "Description": [" 10 beads made of different shapes and materials. A: Bead in the shape of a Lupin bean, somewhat square with rounded edges, quite thick, both halves are divided by a sharp well defined edge. The material seems to be obsidian or black stone, incredible well polished and shiny. B: Three spherical beads, one of the broken into three fragments, made of some glass material in a green colour. The material did not seem to have been fired high enough as the core shows separate lumps that didn't melt properly. The broken one is covered in salt accretions. C: Elongated spherical bead made of faience with a white glazing, broken at one end. Greenish inclusion in the core. D: One barrel shaped bead made of bone. E: One spacer-bead, preserved in two segments, made of faience with remains of a yellow glaze. F: One disc-shaped bead with a high width, made of light green faience. G: One flattened spherical bead made of white faience. H: One disc-shaped bead made of ostrich eggshell.
