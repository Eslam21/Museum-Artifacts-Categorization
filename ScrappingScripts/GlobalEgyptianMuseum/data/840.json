{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.5699", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "CLOTH/SHROUD", "Material": "FLAX", "Technique": "WOVEN; PAINTED", "Height": "70 cm", "Width": "90 cm", "Name": "Shroud of Osiris", "Description": "This fragment in linen cloth, which dates from the Roman Period, is the upper part of a large shroud representing the god Osiris mummiform. The oval face has two black eyes elongated by a cosmetic line and a large nose. On the cheeks two bandages descend which serve to fix the false beard. The body is wrapped in an envelope of netting in dark red and decorated black and blue. The god, who is dressed in  the atef-crown, wears a wesekh-collar and a pectoral in the form of a naos. The face of  Osiris is framed by two kneeling mourners; they are probably a representation of  Isis and Nephthys. The shroud is also decorated with djed-pillars and small papyrus columns. This type of shroud, of which the iconography is certainly of pharaonic tradition, is rather rare."}
