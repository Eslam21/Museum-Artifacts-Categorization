The sole is swayed for the right foot and consists of three layers secured with leather thong stitches along the edge as well as with three rows lengthwise down the centre. The insole is decorated with impressed rosettes, roughly extending halfway the length of the sole (seen from the front). The edge of the upper inserts between the insole and midsole. The medial part is rounded, and the lateral part extends as a narrow strip toward the front, where it was attached to the sole, forming toe bands: one for the big toe and one for the remaining toes. The upper is decorated with impressed motifs and a vertical series of slits. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Roman Period (?) ", " Late Antique (?) ", " Early Islamic (?)
