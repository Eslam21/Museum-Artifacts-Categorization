The message on this card reads: \"unless there is a m'sieur [i.e. monsieur] to object. Many thanks for promise of photo. I want to see if you are like \"the Organ Girl\". Very sorry to hear you will be unable to go to Scarboro[ugh], our next port of call is Jaffa. An excursion is being run to Jerusalem. But I have already been so I shall not take advantage of it this time. Will try & get some PCs of there however.\" The content of the message suggests the sender may be on military service and this would be consistent with a date of about 1920, although the card itself is slightly earlier. The closing reference to getting some postcards of a place the sender isn't even going to is an interesting piece of social history and also testimony to the power of Jerusalem."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["lighthouse"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Alexandria (Egypt), Lighthouse "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Jim Schofield"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased 22nd September 2013."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["EPH-ME.1802"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: L.S. 27 (printed postcard number) "]}
