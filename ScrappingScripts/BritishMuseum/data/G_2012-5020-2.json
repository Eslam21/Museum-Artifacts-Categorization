Scarab-back impression rather worn, and overlaid with some whitish paste on smooth band above. Lower surface of mould is concave, as normal for Naukratis. Back of mould roughly modelled, as all moulds, with central depression, where clay pushed onto positive mould.

Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-5). Gorton, A.
