{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "32618", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "52 cm", "Width": "15 cm", "Depth": "16.5 cm", "Name": "Statue of young pharaoh", "Description": "Statue of a Ptolemaic king in striding pose. The head is covered with a \"nemes\", the eyes are almond shape, the nose is straight and pointed and the lips are thin. He has a thoughtful expression, not heroic, and a childlike appearance more than youthful. The hips are covered with a short skirt (schendit), held up from the waist, from where an animal tail hangs down. He is wearing an wesekh necklace, and holds the life sign in his right hand and a folded handkerchief in his left hand. The childlike appearance is not surprising since some of the Ptolemies reached the throne at a very young age. It should not be forgotten, on the other hand, that the style in the Ptolemaic period is idealistic, as shown in this sculpture."}
