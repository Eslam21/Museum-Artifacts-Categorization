Jacobsson dates the seal to the 19th or 20th Dynasty. Dr Marcel Maree of the Department of Egypt and Sudan has confirmed that the form of the motifs are no later than the New Kingdom, in which case a Late Bronze Age date is likely. This suggests the item was an heirloom when depoisited in the tomb."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gem / Catalogue of Engraved Gems & Cameos, Greek, Etruscan & Roman in the British Museum (152) ", " Murray, Smith and Walters 1900 / Excavations in Cyprus (p. 81, Tomb 1, no. 1; pl.
