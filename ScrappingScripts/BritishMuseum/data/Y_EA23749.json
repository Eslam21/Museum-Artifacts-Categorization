{"artifact_name": "lid", "Object Type": ["lid"], "Museum number": ["EA23749"], "Description": [" A heavy jar-stopper made of red siltware pottery. The fabric contains grit and voids from burned-out chaff. The top is convex and has been roughly smoothed. On the underside there is an integral projecting boss of hemispherical shape, designed to fit the mouth of a vessel. All the lower part was made as a unit, expanding from the boss to a wide flange with an incurved edge. The hollow interior was sealed by adding more clay to bridge the top. The seam of this closure lies about 2cm from the perimeter of the object. The incised mark on the side is Petrie\u2019s Findspot number.
