This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the decorative motif finds parallels with his South Ionian little master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9C. Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana, Band, and Gordion cups. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. The suffix \"21\" was added by the British Museum's Naukratis cataloguing project to distinguish the sherd from the other AM1371 sherds.
