The sale catalogue description of the lots notes: 'Giov. d'Athanasi states that these three relics were purchased of an Arab at Memphis, who, however, gave no account in what tomb the body to which they belonged was discovered. The great probability is, that it was one of a royal personage, and it is not unlikely but that the whole body was thus encased with gold, for the possession of which it was destroyed.' The object was possibly part of the trappings of the mummy of General Djehuty (temp. Thutmose III), which was discovered at Saqqara in the early 1820s: J H Taylor, 'Notes on the Tomb of General Djehuty' (forthcoming).
