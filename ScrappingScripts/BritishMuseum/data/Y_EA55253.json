{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA55253"], "Description": [" Green siltstone head from a statue of a young male figure, the body and base now missing. The figure is depicted with short stylised curly hair, set high on the forehead and with the small sized ears exposed. The detailed curls follow a slightly irregular line across the brow. The facial features have been executed to a high quality, with subtle modelling of the youthful skin across the forehead, slightly sunken skin under the eyes, prominent cheekbones, and a pronounced jawline. The eyes are wide and almond shaped, with a heavy upper eyelid and sharply defined brow which is set close to the eyes and converges with the bridge of the nose. The hooked nose is long and slim, with a clear cupid\u2019s bow at the upper lip. The lips are slightly parted with a much fuller lower lip, and the outer corners and lower lip sharply incised. On the reverse the curled hairstyle continues down the nape of the neck, and there appears to be no surviving trace of a back-pillar. The statue head, broken off from the neck, has also suffered damage to the tip of the nose and the tops of both ears with part of the right ear now missing. Small chips to the eyelids and at the forehead are also visible.

The stylistic features and the contrast of the smoothed face and unpolished curls of the hair are noted to resemble other surviving heads which combine Egyptian and Greek artistic characteristics (James and Davies 1983). The head is described as originating from Alexandria, however a more precise findspot is uncertain (PM VIII). Further Bibliography: H.
