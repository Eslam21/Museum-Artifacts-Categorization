", " The context of discovery was recorded by Petrie in his journal: \u2018Two or three iron fish hooks in good state were found in one Ptolemaic chamber, when we were digging for bronzes; these explain a lot of lead pieces [sketch] which are therefore probably net sinkers. \u2026 In the Ptolemaic house by the bronze find we get a quantity of iron fish hooks, 13 perfect, 17 slightly broken, & many pieces beside three bronze ones. These show that the canal here must have been more important, and that they caught big fish.\u2019 (Petrie Journal 165, 174). This location is described as \u2018a chamber at the south end of the town, probably of the beginning of the Ptolemaic period\u2019 (Petrie 1886, 39, marked \u2018Ptolemaic building\u2019 on Pl.XLI). However, the 'cache of bronzes', that Petrie dated to the Ptolemaic period also, can now be dated to the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015) so an earlier date for these is more likely than that given by Petrie (1886, 39). A number of barbed fishooks were found at Naukratis, made of iron (Montreal, Redpath Museum 2518.01, 2518.02; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.356; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum E.14a-c.1885; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,126.b, 9,9,86,126.a; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1886.533, AN1886.532; Bolton Museum 1886.31.75.1-d) and copper alloy (British Museum GR1888,0601.7; Bolton 1886.31.73.m; Cairo JE26772.1-2; Montreal, Redpath Museum 2519a; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1886.535). The naukratis examples are unusually large, when compared to those from marine multiple hooked fishing lines , that are usually only 2 cm long (Thomas 2010; 2011; Copeland 2011). Copeland, P. 2011.
