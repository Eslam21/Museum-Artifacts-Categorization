XIV, no. 2). When complete, it would have represented a kneeling offering bearer raising up her hands and carrying above her head a bounded ibex (Wallert 1967, pl. 39, no. K20). Parallels of the Saite-Persian period are found in the Delta, especially in Sais (Wallert 1967, 45) and Memphis (Anthes 1965, 102, pl. 38c-d, no. 50). Offering spoons are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. I. Wallert listed Bubastis, Tanis, Zagazig, Sais, Saqqara and Memphis (Wallert 1967, 53). Naukratis provided too a few of these relatively common Egyptian ex-votos. The iconography displayed on these objects is often linked with offerings or the act of offering and they are often associated to deities of fertility and regeneration (Bult\u00e9 2008). This specimen looks like an appropriate offering to dedicate to Aphrodite who was strongly assimilated to the Egyptian goddess Hathor (Masson forthcoming).
