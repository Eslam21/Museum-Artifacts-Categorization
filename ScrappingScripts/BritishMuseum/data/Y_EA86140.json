{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA86140"], "Description": [" Axe head made of dark grey basalt, roughly rectangular in shape with one side forming the rounded blade with a mostly sharp and well defined edge. It is tapered toward the butt with two small protruding lugs onto which the handle was attached. The general shape is slightly asymmetrical. Traces of wear at the cut edge with an area of 1.7cm chipped off. The surface is roughly pitted at the butt end and smoothed at the blade end. The lateral edges underneath the lugs as well as the edge of the butt end show signs of deliberate roughening to enable a better grip for the binding. Some areas were later smoothed from the binding.
