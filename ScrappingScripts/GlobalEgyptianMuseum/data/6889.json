The surface has been burnished, though the gloss is extremely faded. The exterior is red, except near the rim, which is black. It bears traces of a red slip as well as a punctated \"dents de loup\" design (\"wolf's teeth\" motif) that is visible only in certain areas. It is likely that this preliminary decoration was made in order to enhance a rippled effect which was eventually not achieved by the craftsman The lip is decorated with delicate cross hatching that is more or less perpendicular to the rim."}
