", " The sherd possibly belongs to the same vase as University College Dublin 309. Lemos does not place this sherd in the W\u00fcrzburg Chalice Group, but if the sherd belongs with UCD 309, then it ought to be included there alongside the UCD sherd which Lemos specifies was decorated by the Painter of the W\u00fcrzburg Chalices. The sherds from this group display stylistic similarities to the two W\u00fcrzburg chalices, see Lemos 1991, pls 20-1, nos 236-7. However the manner in which the goat's eye is depicted differs from those on the W\u00fcrzburg chalices. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
