Published in1683 as part of a larger volume (\u865e\u521d\u65b0\u8a8c), Verbiest's essay was well known to Japanese intellectuals by the mid Edo period (18th c.). This print is from a series that seems intended to illustrate the Seven Wonders. Multiple copies are known for five designs in the series (including this one), suggesting that the remaining two designs were never published. The other four designs depict the Colossus of Rhodes, a pyramid in Egypt, the city of Babylon, and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (which the print calls \"The Tomb of Mausolus\", yet another Ancient Wonder). The title of this print refers to a marble sculpture of Zeus by Phidias, located in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia; however the illustration is completely unrelated. Kuninaga probably was not referring to Verbiest's illustrated text when he designed this series. He may have been drawing on random pieces of information and an assortment of imported copperplate prints depicting the Seven Wonders, without properly understanding his sources. Perhaps the series stopped at five because complete information was not available. This print depicts Dutchmen in a Euro-Chinese-style hall, perhaps copying one or more imported copperplate prints.
