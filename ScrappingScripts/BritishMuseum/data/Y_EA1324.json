{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1324"], "Description": [" Stela of Kainefer: the figures and texts on the stela are finely carved, the figures being in low relief and the texts in sunk relief, apart from those accompanying the figures of Kaiwareb. The texts it bears commemorate the Prince, Kainefer, son of King Snofru, and they are mostly concerned with his titles and dignities. The lintel and drum carry short texts with brief titles, and the full list of Kainefer's honours is reserved for the upper parts of the two panels on either side of the false doorway; each panel has six lines of text. The lower parts of these panels are divided into two registers. Contrary to the regular practice, there are no representations of Kainefer himself; on both sides there are large figures of his eldest son Kaiwareb, dressed in official uniform and carrying a sceptre and a staff. On the left Kaiwareb is shown accompanied by 'his son' (i.e. probably Kainefer's son), Kainefer; on the right he is accompanied by Pt\u1e25-\u0161psi, who is not named as a son. The bottom register on each side is occupied by three figures of men, all possibly sons or other relatives of Kainefer, and all presumably bearing offerings (although this is now certain in only one case): on the left, Kaiwareb, 'I\u1e6f\u1ec9 and l\u1ec9w\u1ec9; on tne right Dw\u0292.t(w)-Snfrw, \u1e2a\u2018.f-Snfrw and B\u0292.f-Snfrw. The surface is much weathered and further deterioration has more recently occurred through the action of salt. The stela was cut into several pieces for ease of transport and considerable portions have been lost at the cuts, especially in the centre, where, happily, no text or representation has perished. No colour remains.
