This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " More than a hundred votive boxes were discovered in Naukratis. The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen associating three snakes could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). Petrie indeed signalled one bronze box with three snakes (Petrie 1886, 41). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Votive boxes of this peculiar type were particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (Weiss 2012, 276-277). This votive box seems to be a variant of the type T 13 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 725-727, Pl. 42c, 75a/g, 77l, Typ T 13, esp. Nr. 741-743, 745-746 from Naukratis).
