", " The thickness of the sherd suggests that it may have come from a large chalice or heavy chalice. There is a modern drill hole on the break of the sherd. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it was found that the fabric originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286). It must also be pointed out that despite Jones' identification of the sherd as being in the Chalice Style, the sherd firmly belongs within the earlier Grand Style.
