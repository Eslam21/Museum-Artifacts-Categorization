The middle section is comprised of twenty small, tube-shaped beads (0,25 x 0,25 cm) cut from tube-shaped shells(?). Making an ostrich eggshell bead included cutting a fragment of the shell to the desired size by breaking small chips around the circumference, then piercing it and finally smoothing the edges by rubbing it carefully. Many pieces broken during manufacture are discovered in habitation sites, thus indicating a great loss of raw material."}
