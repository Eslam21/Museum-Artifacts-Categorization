The surface engraved with a decoration represents a human standing bearded figure of a deity, on top of floor line, wearing a kilt and a high headdress, cap or wig with long hair, looking rightwards while walking leftwards, and holding up two crocodiles by the tails, heads down, jaws opened, crested on their back. The image recalls the oriental pattern of the Master of the Animals, as well as, in an Egyptian context, the young Harpocrate.
