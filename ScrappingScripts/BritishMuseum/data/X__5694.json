", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. Anubis is present in Naukratis through several small amuletic figures made out of glazed composition, like this specimen, or copper alloy (Masson forthcoming). Anubis is often associated to Wepwawet (Upuaut) who is regarded in some Egyptian myths as Anubis son and with whom he is often confused in the late periods. These amulets might be related with the cult of Wepwawet, well attested in the nearby Sais which held a lot of influence over Naukratis (on various cults celebrated at Sais: Weiss 2012, 448-452).
