{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 7306", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED RECEPTACLE", "Material": "POTTERY; MORTAR", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL; BURNED; GLAZED; INCISION; SCULPTURED", "Height": "75 cm", "Diameter": "35 cm", "Name": "Black Glazed Hydria", "Description": "The black glazed hydria, a three-handled water jug with two handles on the sides for lifting and a third at the back for pouring, is topped with a figure of a woman. The reddish brown color around the lower part of the belly of the vase and the handle indicates a misfiring. This type of elaborate vase was common in the Hellenistic world. The brown-black glaze was perhaps intended to imitate more expensive metal versions of the same shaped vase. The applied reliefs, handles, and the ribbing indicate that a metal model was followed. The decoration consists of large intertwined ivy leaves and berries that are painted white, which is a characteristic of the Cretan workshops. A series of female figures also decorates the vase. They are draped in sleeveless chitons, or knee-length garments, with one arm either raised in a gesture of reverence, or perhaps indicating that they are dancing.These figures were made in the same mold and applied to the vase before firing. In between them are masks of Queen Athena."}
