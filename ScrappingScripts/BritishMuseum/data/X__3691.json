From the photographs provided by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (two views of undersides and one of a back), it is not sure which one corresponds to this scarab. In any case, they seem to be genuine products of the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). Lion attacking a prey is a recurrent theme on Egyptian blue scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d. This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype B). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122).
