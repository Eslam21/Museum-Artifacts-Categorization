Lemos does not discuss this sherd but it ought to belong in her Group of Worshippers from the Simple Animal Style. The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which bears the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1012) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.379"]}
