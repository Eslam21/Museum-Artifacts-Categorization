Created to cover the mummy in the inner coffin, the mask shows Isis' rounded face. Her nose and lips are modeled in subtle relief. Her earlobes, adorned with gold earrings, are visible on both sides of her fleshy face. On her head, she wears a long wig fashionable at this period. The wig is bound at the top with a wide floral fillet, or ribbon. It is tied at the sides with intricately patterned ribbons. Over the chest is an enormous floral collar with ornamental lotus flowers."}
