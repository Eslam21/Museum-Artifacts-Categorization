", " This piece is now lost. Brief description ('negro head blue paste') with sketch from Chautauqua distribution list of the Egypt Exploration Fund. It is possible to identify the scaraboid with Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII no. 32 and Petrie 1889, pl. 61, no. 1959. The drawing of the motif on the underside, much clearer in the publication (goddess Maat and her feather above a nb basket), matches the sketch and the publication states that it is made out of blue paste. However, the publication illustrated this piece as if it was a scarab and not an African head-shaped scaraboid.

This piece belongs to a type which was produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (on this production, see Webb forthcoming) and was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Carthage, Kerkouan, Sicily and Gibraltar, but also in Greece, Cyprus and Rhodes (Gorton 1996, 118-121, type XXXIII, subtype A5-24 for scarabs not scaraboids, see especially A21 for this piece).
