{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7440", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Width": "15.2 cm", "Name": "Execration figurine", "Description": "This clay figurine is part of a large number of similar objects purchased by Jean Capart in Cairo in 1938. They probably came from the necropolis of Saqqara, like a similar group kept in the Cairo Museum. They schematically represent a kneeling person with his arms tied behind his back. The surface of the body is covered with texts written in red and black ink, in very cursive hieratic, which is difficult to read. These objects symbolise individuals and nations hostile to the king and to Egypt, which were intended to be ritually destroyed."}
