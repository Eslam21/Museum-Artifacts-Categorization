{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M13998a", "Dating": "22ND DYNASTY ?; 25TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS OF HUMANS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Width": "50 cm", "Depth": "40 cm", "Name": "Coffin", "Description": "A mummiform coffin belonging to the lady <!-->Isis (Aset), badly damaged by fire and later restored, much of the original decoration has disappeared. The mummy inside the coffin dates to a later period (see number M13998). According to the earlier records the box was painted on the outside with vignettes and religious texts and decorated with a frieze of uraei and feathers, it was obviously once very richly decorated and coloured. Inside at the head end was a Ba-bird with wings spread and figures of the god Shu on either side. The whole of the back and sides was covered with religious scenes. Unfortunately little of this has survived.Similarly, the lid was described as being painted, the finely modelled face was flesh-coloured and varnished, to either side was a long wig, painted in squares of blue and yellow, with vulture wings at each side of the face. There is a pectoral of lotus petals, a pendant with a scarab and stars and figures of deities under a fillet of lotus petals in rectangles. Again all is lost and only the right-hand side of the box retains it's decoration to any extent. Below all of this were two vertical bands of inscription and three at the feet, the text in each instance is the same and appears to be an utterance honouring the deceased.The bottom part is also damaged but again was brightly painted with protective symbols and deities."}
