His head is shaven except for his side-lock, and he wears an Egyptian Double Crown flanked by lotus buds held by a ribbon that crosses above his brow. The back is plain and a large part of it is lost. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions, the front covered with a very thin matt red slip.
