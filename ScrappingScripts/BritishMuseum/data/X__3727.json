", " A similar scarab was found in Ibiza (Gorton 1996, Type V, nos 2 and 5). Gorton consider this scarab to be either a genuine Hyksos-style scarab or a late imitation of this style (Gorton 1996, 18). An Hyksos date is probably too early, though genuine early scarabs were discovered in Naukratis (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). A relatively similar composition, with a Menkheperra cartouche replacing the hes vase, is provided by a scarab found in the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 151; discussed in Jaeger 1982, 89, \u00a7 386). A 26th dynasty date is therefore more probable.
