{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA30726"], "Description": [" A pottery model of an Isis-situla with a round-sectioned curved handle crossing the top, and an oval body below a bead rim, with a finial at the bottom. Triple ridges run vertically from the handle-springs to the finial, and triple swags in relief cross the body on each side. The finial has two flat faces and is of necked triangular shape, decorated by incuse cross-hatching. There is minor damage to one handle-spring, with a small patch of restoration nearby. Two-piece mould with added hand-modelled handle. Micaceous brown Nile silt. The body, except for the rim, is painted yellow, and the side-ridges, swags and finial are painted black. The swags and side-ridges are edged with white paint, the central swag has a row of white dots and the central side-ridge a white line; traces of white paint survive on the faces of the finial.
