He looks with a sly leer to the right, where a little band of ragged and emaciated French soldiers hurry towards him making gestures of dismay. He wears the embroidered fastened coat or tunic with a sash of authentic portraits, without a hat; he points up towards a vision in the sky surrounded by massive clouds of a sceptre and imperial crown superimposed on the revolutionary fasces and axe. Above the general flies a figure of Fame, smiling sardonically and pointing down derisively. Two soldiers in cocked hats who stand in the boat waiting for Bonaparte to embark greedily hug large money-bags. A plank slants from the boat to the shore. The boat has a figure-head composed of two heads facing opposite ways wearing a single coronet. Behind the French troops is a small encampment with tricolour tents and flags. Behind this stretches a vast Turkish camp with crescent flags. Beneath the title: 'For an illustration of the above, see, the Intercepted Letters from the Republican General Kleber, to the French Directory, respecting the Courage, Honor & Patriotic Views, of - \"the Deserter of the Army of Egypt\".' 8 March 1800 Hand-coloured etching.

They contained Bonaparte's instructions to Kleber on his departure, and official dispatches from Kleber and others to the Directory, and covered the period from 23 Aug. to 17 Sept. 1799. Kleber wrote:'. . . Bonaparte quitted this country for France . . . without saying a word of his intention to any person whatever. He had appointed me to meet him at Rosetta on the subsequent day!' (pp. 38-9). General Dugua wrote to Barras: 'I confess to you . . . that I could never have believed General Bonaparte would have abandoned us in the condition in which we were; without money, without powder, without ball . . . more than a third of the army destroyed by the plague, the dysentery, by ophthalmia, and by the war; that which remains almost naked, and the enemy but eight days march from us!' (pp. 158-9). The publication of the letters caused a great sensation ('Lond. Chron.', 17 Jan.). The introduction was supposed to be by Canning, the notes by William Gifford.
