{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8472"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Herires: there are three registers on this round-topped stela. In the upper register is a winged sun-disk beneath which is a scarab beetle. The middle register shows Osiris on the right behind an altar on which stands a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. On the other side of the altar stand the deceased with arms raised in adoration and four gods, the first possibly another form of Osiris, the second Shu or Imsety, Atum, and Ra-Horakhty. Five lines of text in the third register consist of a prayer to Osiris on behalf of Herires, son (sic) of Pwy-\u1e25tf (?) and the lady 'Irty-rw. The stela is battered about the edges especially on the right side, and cracked on the surface. There is a large gouge on the back. There is a multi-coloured band of green, red, and yellow rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in black around the stela and between the registers. The background of the stela is white. The disk is green with black uraei, green-dotted upper wings, yellow striped middle wings with a red lower edge, and green-striped lower wings edged in black. The beetle is green and the hieroglyphs are green and yellow. In the second register the figure of Osiris has a yellow crown with green feathers, red face with black beard, white upper body, and green body and hands. The altar and pot are red and the lotus green with a black stem. The figure has a red face and lower body, white upper body, black hands, and white feet outlined in black. The gods have alternately green and red bodies. They all have white collars and carry green sceptres. The faces of the first two are red, the beards black, and the wigs white outlined in black. The first has a green head-dress and the second a red feather. Atum has a red face, black beard, and green head-dress, while Ra-Horakhty has a green disk, and white face and wig with black outlines. The hieroglyphs in the third register are a combination of red and green between alternating yellow and red lines. The back and sides are plastered.
