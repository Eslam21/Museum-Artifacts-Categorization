The clearest human figure stands left of centre facing left. This figure wears a long white apron hanging down before and behind from the waist. To the upper right of this is another figure, facing left and with one leg folded at the knee as if reclining and a raised left arm. Above this figure is a long, thin arc in white domed upward (roof?) with what appear to be four objects (implements?) in brown and white, hanging from it by straps. To the lower right of the rightmost shape, which hangs from a thin brown loop, is an unidentified shape in brown. Further right still is the infilled image of an unidentified animal (cow?) facing left. At the far right of the image is the head of a brown and white bichrome infilled cow, upright and facing left, cut off the edge of the image at the neck; at the bottom left is the very eroded head and neck of a giraffe looking right and cut off the edge of the image at the neck, and to the left of the image is brown rump and tail of another cow facing left and cut off the edge of the image at the hip.
