{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 52564", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "20 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a Boy", "Description": "In Ancient Egypt, young male children depicted in sculpture or wall paintings were mostly shown nude and uncircumcised. They would also be shown with a side lock of hair and an index finger in their mouth. The late Old Kingdom statuette depicts a young boy, who is nude. The boy wears a nicely arranged curly black wig, which flares a little to the sides. The wide eyes and eyebrows are painted black. The artist modeled the upper part of the body well, although the arms are too long. The lower part is not well proportioned and the clumsily sculpted feet are attached to a small base."}
