{"artifact_name": "textile; wrapping", "Object Type": [" textile ", " wrapping "], "Museum number": ["EA78727"], "Description": [" Two small wool textile fragments (fabric types B and F) two of which are sewn to one another [Main and 2nd fabric] and used as a wrapping. No evidence of association could be observed between the connected Main/2nd fabric and the 3rd fabric. The spinning direction of warp and weft of all fragments is 's'. The first piece is an irregular shape, a natural colour, with plain weft-faced weave. Some of the warp is overspun. The thread count is warp 6 per 10mm and weft 32 per 10mm. The second piece is dark brown with two red woven bands [warp direction, 1cm wide] as decoration, attached to he first piece by stitching [ss/zply] with dark brown thread. The thread count is warp 6 per 10mm and weft 24 per 7mm. The third piece is a dark blue band, with a neatly folded edge stitched with bright blue thread [ss/zply], a hem. It has a second band of the same fabric attached to the other edge and sewn: the sewing thread consists of 2 elements 's'-spun and 'z'-plied, light brown in colour. The textile thread count is warp 7 per 10mm and weft 14 per 10mm. Some of the warp threads are overspun.
