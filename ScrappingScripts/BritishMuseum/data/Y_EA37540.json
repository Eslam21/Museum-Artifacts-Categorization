{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA37540"], "Description": [" A terracotta head of the Egyptian Hermes, broken from a flask and probably of bust form. The head is beardless, with tightly curled hair; within the hair, above the temples, are small wings, and a lotus petal is set over the brow. The mouth of the flask, with a carinated profile and two small handles, rises from the top of the head. Made in a two-piece, or possibly three-piece, mould. Orange-brown Nile silt, with many white inclusions which have caused much spalling of the surface. Brown slip overall. Probably related to Memphis Black Ware.
