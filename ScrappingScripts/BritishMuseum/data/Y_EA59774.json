This vase belongs to a set of at least four, two containing Delta wine and two containing wine from the south. Wallis, in his catalogue of part of the Macgregor collection written in 1898, described these vases as 'the most important decorated Egyptian un-glazed vases yet discovered'. Vintage wines seem to have been the prerogative of the king - as this one of King Tutankhamun, 'Year 5. Sweet wine of the House of Aton of the Western River. Chief vintner Nakht' suggests. Detailed labels of this type are rare for wine destined for private persons.
