{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 37032", "Dating": "HOREMHEB/DJESERKHEPERURE-SETEPENRE", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "60 cm", "Name": "Statue of Horemheb", "Description": "This statue represents a male figure, most probably King Horemheb, the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. He is shown striding forward, wearing a short kilt and the Blue Crown of war ornamented with a uraeus, or royal cobra. The king's left arm is by his side; the right hand holds a standard. The upper part of the standard is missing, which prevents the identification of the deity that was depicted upon it. The statue bears no inscription, which would have allowed identification of this king. However, the lean body, almond eyes, small straight lips and the median line bisecting the torso, suggest that the statue represents King Horemheb. The artistic style is that of the Eighteenth Dynasty, prior to the time of King Amenhotep the Third."}
