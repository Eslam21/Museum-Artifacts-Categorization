One hand holds a cruciform symbol, apparently fastened to a chain around the waist. This evidence has been used to suggest that the deceased was a Christian, containing the mummy of a small child, sex uncertain, wrapped in interwoven linen bandages with a fringe around the head. A compact sandy material, possibly a form of coarse plaster, holds the body in its coffin.
