The bulk of the surface is occupied by two lines of text containing the standard formula for the receipt of offerings by \u1e25tp-di-nsw. At the left-hand end is a representation of Nykaiankh, seated and holding a staff. There is a large fracture towards the left end, and along this break and along the breaks between the various blocks making up the architrave (which was cut into convenient pieces for transport) some damage to signs has occurred. The surface at the right-hand end has suffered some flaking due to the action of salt. No colour remains.
