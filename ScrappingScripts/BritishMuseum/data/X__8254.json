", " Discoid weights are not that commonly found in Egypt in general, though they do appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 2, fig. 13 and fig. 26). They are usually of small size and mass. Although they are more often made out of igneous rock, they also occur regularly in bronze, like this specimen. This weight could correspond to 1 uncia, a Graeco-Roman standard (27-28 g), although the corrosion has likely altered the original mass (on bronze weights of the uncia standard discovered in Egypt: Cour-Marty 1985, 191).
