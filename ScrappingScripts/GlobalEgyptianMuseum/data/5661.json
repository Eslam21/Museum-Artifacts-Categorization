{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "8470", "Dating": "27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES (not before)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED ROCK", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "57 cm", "Width": "18.7 cm", "Depth": "29.8 cm", "Name": "Naophorous statue", "Description": "This kneeling naophorous statue of a man is unfinished; the kilt, the figure in the naos, the smoothing of the wig and the inscription were all left unfinished. There is a smooth rounded roll around the neck of the man. He is leaning against a back pillar and is holding the sides of the naos at the bottom in his small hands. The mummiform god in the naos is probably Osiris. Statues like these are seldom found after the 27th Dynasty, but certain features suggest it should be dated to this period or later."}
