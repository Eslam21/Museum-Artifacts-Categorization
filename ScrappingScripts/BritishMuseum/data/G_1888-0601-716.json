The festival was celebrated in Athens by women only as early as the 5th century BC. In June or July each year, women in Athens would climb to their rooftops and plant gardens of Adonis. Here, they would mourn, much as Aphrodite did, the death of Adonis (Aristophanes 'Lysistrata' 389-97). Ladders are also associated with nuptial themes. Such scenes are observed on lebes gamikoi. Perhaps here, the ladder provides the bride with access to the bridal chamber or thalamos. Symbolically, the ladder might represent the woman's transition in life from maiden to wife and later to mother. Rosenzweig, R, 'Worshipping Aphrodite: Art and Cult in Classical Athens' 2004, 63-8.
