Sold in the Spencer sale as anonymous, it was attributed to Carpaccio in the 1943 Sotheby auction. In the Departmental Register it was initially entered as Girolamo da Santa Croce, transferred by A.E. Popham to Benedetto Diana in April 1947 then to Pellegrino da San Daniele in May 1950 - at some unspecified period this attribution was evidently abandoned and it was placed once more under Diana's name. Popham's attribution to Diana was based on the general similarity of the drawing's composition to his painting of the Assumption in S. Maria della Croce, Crema, commissioned in 1501 and probably finished by the middle of the next decade (Bora fig. 55). In truth, the resemblance between the two is not close, and Bora correctly rejected the attribution. The drawn 'Assumption' has more in common with Titian's celebrated painting in the Frari (1518), an influence not seen in the Crema painting, and this is perhaps an indication that the artist responsible for the BM work was of a younger generation than Diana. The finished nature of the drawing, with the subjects of the predella panels literally spelt out, indicates that this was to be shown to the client for approval. The artist has suggested two alternative solutions for the frame, and this led Humfrey to suggest that the drawing would then have been passed on to the frame maker. This is entirely possible although he would have needed a drawing with measurements to construct it. The inscription linking this to the church of the Eremitani may be the work of an optimistic collector hoping to connect it with Mantegna's fresco of the Assumption in the Ovetari chapel. Lit: A.E.
