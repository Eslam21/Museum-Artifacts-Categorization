It is a typical example of the mediocre quality of middle ranking officials of the late Old Kingdom. The scene in the upper register depicts him in front of an offering table; in the inscription he is called \"overseer of builders\". On the right is his wife Nefer-wates. Above the offering table, on their own baseline, are vessels for washing and more dishes with food on a small offering table. In the lower register are the three children of the deceased and two further offering bearers."}
