"], "Materials": ["glazed composition"], "Technique": ["glazed"], "Dimensions": [" Diameter: 6.30 centimetres (max) ", " Height: 6.50 centimetres (max) "], "Curator's comments": ["At least six foundation deposits were discovered in Ptolemy II gateway of the Great Temenos, one at each of the four corners and one at the northwest and southwest corners of a central hall (Petrie 1886, 28-31, pl. 25-26; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. 5-6, pl. 19 and 21-23). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). Eight libation-vases were discovered in the foundation deposits: two in the north-east corner, two in the south-east one, two in the south-west one and two in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. 25 no. 12-13). The British Museum register records that this object was 'found in the Museum' and, subsequently, transferred to the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan, along with four others faience vessels (the offering cups nos. 1920. 1113. 2 - 5). The object possibly belongs with consignment intended for Berlin (Petrie 1886, 30-31). If this assumption is true, then this vase would pertain to the south-east deposit. Small faience vessels tend to act as substitute of ceramics\u2019 models in the foundation deposits of the Ptolemaic period (Weinstein 1973, 356-357). They are often just small cups, but they can reproduce more complex vase shapes, such as this libation-vase (see also a double Hes-vase from a foundation deposit at Herakleion-Thonis: Goddio, Fabre 2008, no. 390).
