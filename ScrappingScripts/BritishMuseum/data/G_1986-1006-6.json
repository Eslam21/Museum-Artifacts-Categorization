{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1006.6"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of woman. A standing woman, a beneficent demon, wearing a long chiton with short sleeves, over which is draped a wide himation, angled from her left shoulder under her right breast. The double neckline of the chiton may indicate an undergarment. Her hair has a centre parting and falls in waves on each side of her face; she wears a tightly woven wreath. Her ears are pierced from front to back. Her right arm is closely bent, with the hand raised, palm outwards; the fingers are lost, and an object with three parallel pendants is largely lost with them. Her lowered left arm is bent but broken away below the elbow: no doubt it also had the palm of the hand out-turned in a protective gesture; a small basket is slung from the crook of the arm. The feet are gone and there are indications that the figure had no plinth. The back has only very superficial detail. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt, with traces of an overall white dressing.
