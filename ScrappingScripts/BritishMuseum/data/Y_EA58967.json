{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA58967"], "Description": [" Limestone block statue of an official named Huy. He wears a shoulder length double-wig that bears faded traces of black paint. His eyes are wide set with black paint also used to denote his eyebrows and the slim cosmetic lines around his eyes. There are traces of a lighter yellow colour around the edges of his wig and face. There is no indication of his neck at the top of the block form. The contours of his body are indicated at both sides with curves to show his arms and thighs, and a narrowing at the waist. A short column of text is inscribed across the front of the block with a border that is left open at the top and bottom. There is a faint trace of blue paint within the initial sign at the beginning of this inscription. Two further short horizontal lines of text begin at the front of the base and extend onto the sides. On the reverse is a broad back-pillar with a single column of text, with traces of white paint in several of the incised signs. There are visible scratches to the stone including at the front of the statue base above the text, and a small chip at the border of the inscription on the left side of the base.

Non-royal statues were typically set up in the tomb during the Middle and New Kingdom, but increasingly throughout the first millenium BC such monuments were also dedicated in temple spaces.
