J. Hughes, \u201cAnalyses of silver objects in the British Museum\u201d, Nush-i Jan III: The Small Finds, J. E. Curtis et al. (London 1984), pp. 58-60. Persians \u201care very fond of wine, and drink it in large quantities\u201d according to the 5th century BC writer Herodotus (History I.133). Other contemporary accounts describe how a range of red and white wine was consumed in the Persian empire at this period. The coarse elements were strained, the wine was sometimes diluted with water, and the drinking bowls were filled using horn-shaped pourers with animal foreparts which were called rhyta. This combination of standardised equipment and elaborate ceremony were an integral part of what is sometimes called Achaemenid Court Style, and was imitated by the equivalent of the middle classes throughout the Persian (Achaemenid) empire which stretched from Egypt to Pakistan during the 6th-4th centuries BC. This bowl belongs to a classic type of drinking bowl used throughout the empire at this period. They are represented on palace reliefs at Persepolis (in modern Iran), and were widely imitated by local craftsmen in metal and even pottery. These bowls were also placed in graves, underlining the notion that the act of banqueting was so important that it ought to be remembered or continued in the afterlife. This particular bowl was carefully designed to be filled as far as the rounded shoulder, and therefore held just under a third of a litre. The low boss in the centre allowed it to be securely held in one hand, with the finger tips underneath. As with most silver of this period that has been scientifically analysed, it has a very pure composition of about 93% silver with a small amount of copper plus minor natural trace elements. The shape was simply made by hammering a single piece of thick silver sheet.
