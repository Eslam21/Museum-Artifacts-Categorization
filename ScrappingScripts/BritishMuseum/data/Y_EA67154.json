{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA67154"], "Description": [" Fragmentary grey granite seated statue of a male figure, part of the lower body and backless seat now remaining. The figure wears a short knee-length kilt with a curved incised line across his knees indicating the edge of the material. The partially intact right forearm is placed flat across the lap. His legs are broad and placed close together, with the musculature indicated via a thin raised ridge along the front of his calves. His left foot is also broad in size, and has delineated toenails. His right foot is now lost. Each side of the seat has a hollowed out section decorated with an inverted semi-circular shape in the centre. On top of the base at the missing right foot is a partial incised inscription that is now placed closer to the edge due to the loss of the original base. Part of the right arm, upper leg, and a large section of the statue base have been reconstructed in modern times. The right side foot has large chips to the ankle area, and another chip is notable on his left foot. The edges of the seat and base are heavily damaged.

Though the inscription is damaged, the name appears to begin with 'Khenty', and what follows is difficult to determine (Martin 1979). A 3rd Dynasty date for this statue is supported by the broad limbs of the figure and cuboid style of the seat which is shared with other similar sculpture from this period (such as the statue of Ankhwa, EA 171, British Museum, London: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA171).
