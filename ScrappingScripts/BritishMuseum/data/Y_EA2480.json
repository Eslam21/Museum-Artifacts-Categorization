The legs take the form of lion legs, though sat upon small cylindrical supports. These legs are attached to the main part of the chair with mortises and tenons, secured by dowels. The seat of the chair is still partly preserved, with a webbing of woven string. The front side of the chair back is finely decorated, with vertical panels of timber, alternatively darker and lighter in colour, inset to create a decorative frame. The darker timbers have been further embellished with a colum of ivory circles leading to small ivory lotus flowers. The reverse of the chair-back does not feature ivory inlays.
