This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This scarab is published as coming from Naukratis (Budge 1893, no. 365). Scarabs and scaraboids with a lion motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45). This scaraboid is close to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A72a). Let's note that the motif on the underside is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
