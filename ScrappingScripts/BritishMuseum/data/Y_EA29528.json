The religious text begins on the recto (Jesus heals a weeping vine, which perhaps served as a prayer or spell against eye disease) but is interrupted by a rebuke by the scribe Enoch concerning throwing a pen and ink, perhaps directed at the writer of the text. The latter continues onto the verso, and after, the religious text then resumes. Considering the continuation of the text, it seems that the tablet was broken before this was written. Line 8 on the recto is probably a later edition, as it is written in another hand. Published in: Regulski, I. (ed.), 2022.
