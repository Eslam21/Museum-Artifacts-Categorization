{"artifact_name": "inlay", "Object Type": ["inlay"], "Museum number": ["EA29396"], "Description": [" Two mosaic glass slices joined: a grotesque male head, frontal on a dark-blue field, perhaps intended as a tragic mask. The flesh is pale red, the hair and the strands of hair white. Details of face white and black. Triple serrations on each cheek, wide-open mouth. The top edge of the panel is framed with an opaque white and a pale-red rod fused. In turn the ensemble is inset into ancient wood.
