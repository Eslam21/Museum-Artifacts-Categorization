From the photographs provided by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (two views of undersides and one of a back), it is not sure which one corresponds to this scarab. In any case, they seem to be genuine products of the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). Winged mythological creatures are a very popular motif in the Scarab Factory (on this production, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a group well dsitributed in the Mediterranean world (Gorton 1996, 118-121, type XXXIII, subtype C). The two wings marked separately by two upwards curves are characteristics of this subtype in Gorton's typology.
