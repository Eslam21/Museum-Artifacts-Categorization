Kinch, Vroulia, p. 192, confirms the lack of findspot information, Elinor Price in JHS 44, p. 195, cites Camirus as the findspot, with no further comment. The stand (1848.6-19.1.b) originally associated with the dinos (see the illustration in Kinch, Vroulia) does not belong and was recognised as Corinthian by H. Payne, Necrocorinthia, p. 276.
