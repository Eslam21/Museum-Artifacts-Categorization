Kinch places that sherd in his Group B without further precision because of the lack of diagnostic features (reserved handle zone or stemmed foot). If the sherd Kinch published is indeed of the same type as this sherd, we can further precise its grouping to either Group B 1.\u03b1 Group B 1.\u03b2 on account of the reserved handle zone. According to Schlotzhauer, Vroulia cups with a reserved handle zone with a geometric pattern and with a shape similar to South Ionian cups with everted rims (Schlotzhauer Type 8, which coincides with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian cup type A1 and Hayes' Ionian cup type III) may be contemporary and ought to be dated amongst the earliest examples of Vroulia pottery at Naukratis.
