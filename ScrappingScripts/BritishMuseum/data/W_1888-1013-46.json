Moran, \u2018The Amarna Letters\u2019 (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 19-20. In this letter to the king of Egypt, called Naphurareya (Akhenaten), the king of Babylon, Burra-Buriyash recognises the continuing friendship of their countries, but complains of a lack of gift giving. He states that he received only 5 minas of poor quality gold, rather than 20, and suggests that the Egyptian king send representations of animals by skilled craftsmen. Burra-Buriyash sends 2 minas of lapis lazuli with his letter, as well as a necklace of lapis lazuli beads shaped like crickets for the daughter of Akhenaten, Mayati (Meritaten). This clay tablet was found in the modern city of el-Amarna (ancient Akhetaten) along with over 350 others, the majority being diplomatic letters. They are written in cuneiform script, which served as the language of international relations at the time. The Amarna letters concern diplomatic relations between Egypt and both large rival empires and small vassal city states, and deal with matters such as economic exchange, diplomatic marriages, and military threats."], "Bibliographic references": [" Knudtzon, J A 1915a / Die El-Amarna Tafeln (10) ", " Bezold 1892a / The El-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum (3) ", " Leichty E et al 1988a / Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, volume VIII: Tablets from Sippar 3 (p.173) ", " Sigrist M et al 2006a / Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, III "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2011 Jul\u2013Sept, Newcastle, Great North Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Oct\u2013Jan, Dorchester, Dorset County Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Feb\u2013June, Leeds City Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Jul-Oct, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2012 Nov\u2013 Feb 2013, Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2013 Mar\u2013Aug, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2016 8 Mar\u201312 Jun, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018 7 Jun\u201316 Sep, Barcelona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2018-2019 16 Oct\u201320 Jan, Madrid, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019 19 Feb\u201325 Aug, Girona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2019-2020 24 Sept\u201312 Jan, Seville, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2020\u20132021 11 Feb\u201321 Feb, Tarragona, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2021 25 Mar\u201315 Aug, Santiago de Compostela, Museo Centro de Gaias, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2021-2022 15 Sep\u20139 Jan, Zaragoza, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2022 10 Feb\u201315 May, Palma, La Caixa, Pharaoh King of Egypt 2022-2023 21 Jun\u201326 Feb, Valencia, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt 2023 29 Mar\u201323 Jul, Lleida, La Caixa, Pharaoh: King of Egypt "], "Condition": ["Fair; corners are broken."], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Burnaburiash II ", " Named in inscription: Naphurareya ", " Named in inscription: Akhenaten "], "Acquisition name": ["From: Sir Ernest A T Wallis Budge"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Acquisition notes": ["Purchased by Budge in Egypt."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "BM/Big number": ["E29786"], "Registration number": ["1888,1013.46"], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 23 Jun 2011 ", " Treatment: 23 Jun 2011 "]}
