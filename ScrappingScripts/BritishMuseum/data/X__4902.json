{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Greek terracotta figure bust or protome. Small head of a woman with unnaturally long almond-shaped eyes, with a plain mouth (free from the Archaic smile). The cheeks are rounded, and the ears are invisible. The hair is represented by a series of loop-like locks projecting over the forehead, and the head is completed above by a high headdress. The artist apparently depended on his brush for detail as there are traces of white paint upon the face and of yellow on the hair. The treatment of the eyes are difficult to determine, but picked out in black and brown paint. Thin walled with a hard, smooth (almost soapy) light brown fabric and buff surfaces.
