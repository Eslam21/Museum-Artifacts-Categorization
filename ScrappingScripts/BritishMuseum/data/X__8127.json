This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Teardrop, or ovoid, weights are rare in Naukratis as in Egypt in general (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 26, fig. 8, fig. 13 and fig. 26). They appear to be more numerous in the New Kingdom than in later periods (Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 26). These weights are associated either to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet which weights around 9-9,5 g, or to another standard which unit weights around 8g, like this example. The latter standard could correspond to the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). With its mass of 7,9 g, this specimen could correspond more specifically to one shekel. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
