{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86935"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The fragment is concave at the rear showing wooden impression, probably from a peg, in the break impressions of a turned string with a width of 0.22 cm. The front is convex and shows one impression of an almost complete scarab-like seal, with many finger impressions around it. The seal bears a circumferential line and shows a standing figure on the right side, facing towards the left. The figure is wearing a blue crown, one arm hanging down behind the body, probably holding an ankh sign, the second arm is positioned in front of the body holding a HqA-sceptre. In front of the figure a small cartouche (Mn-kheper-R')|. The same motif can be found on EA86936, EA86939 and EA86940.
