{"artifact_name": "wine-jar", "Object Type": ["wine-jar"], "Museum number": ["EA27737"], "Description": [" Tall jar of dull red pottery: with traces of a pale brown wash. The sides expand from the mouth to the shoulder, then converge to a narrow rounded base. Below the rim there is a raised ridge, close to which there are two incised marks. The jar is sealed with a conical clay stopper, which bears the remains of four impressed inscriptions. Only one impression is now reasonably clear, the other three having disappeared except for slight traces.
