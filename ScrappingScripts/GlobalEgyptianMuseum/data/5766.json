These cast bronze aegises imitate the bead necklaces and faience counterpoises used in dance. The semicircular shield with carved lotus petals, lotus buds and papyrus umbels represents a large decorated collar. In the centre is the head of a goddess wearing a striated wig, vulture cap and diadem with uraei. The uraeus on the forehead has broken off, only the lower part of the sun disc with horns has been preserved. Underneath the head is an incised pectoral and a figure of a squatting Osiris flanked by two winged uraei hanging on a cord."}
