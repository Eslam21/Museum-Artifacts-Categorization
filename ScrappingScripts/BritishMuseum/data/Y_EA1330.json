{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1330"], "Description": [" White limestone false-door of Behenu: with a heavy undecorated cavetto-comice and torus-moulding. The upper and lower lintels and the four jamb-panels bear offering-texts containing the titles and dignities of Behenu. At the bottom of each vertical line of text is a standing figure of the lady. These figures and the texts are carved in sunk relief. The rectangular panel above the doorway carries a representation of Behenu seated at an offering-table smelling a pot of ointment; piled offerings are shown beyond the table and a short text at the top contains Behenu's name and an abbreviated list of offerings. The quality of the carving of the whole is moderately good. There is damage along the cuts that were made when the slab was divided into four pieces for easy transport. No colour is preserved.
