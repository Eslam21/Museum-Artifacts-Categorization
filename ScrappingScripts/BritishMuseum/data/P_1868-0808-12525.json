In the foreground (right) the British Lion devours a heap of the little creatures; others flee. An ogre in Turkish costume (left), his profile set in a crescent, grips Bonaparte in his left hand, raising a blood-stained scimitar. Bonaparte attempts to strike with a dagger; he drops a paper: 'Organization of Egypt, & Triumph of Buonaparte'. The Russian bear sits grasping and crushing struggling French apes. On the right the Habsburg eagle, clasping a sheaf of thunderbolts, flies off to the right, tearing a bonnet-rouge in beak and claws. A French army is in flight with a tricolour flag inscribed 'Egalite'. Behind Turkey are Frenchmen impaled on spears. 20 May 1799 Hand-coloured etching "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: James Gillray ", " Published by: Hannah Humphrey "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1799"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 257 millimetres ", " Width: 362 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VII, 1942) A satire on the French reverses of Apr .-May 1799.
