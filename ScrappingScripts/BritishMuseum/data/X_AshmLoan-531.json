", " The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic elements and the absence of decoration on the interior and exterior surfaces make it impossible to determine whether it came from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice.
