{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA38348"], "Description": [" Fragmentary burnt limestone figure of a seated female, the upper body now missing. She wears a long dress which reaches to the ankles as indicated by the faint remaining outline of her clothing along the lower legs. Around the lower edges of the seat on both sides and at the front of the seat beside the lower legs of the figure are traces of a striped pattern, the upper part of each now lost. On the reverse the remains of the block throne include a separate section resembling a back-pillar, which does not appear to be inscribed. In addition to the loss of the upper body of the figure, there is considerable damage to the seat and base of the figure including a large chip to the right side of the seat. The left side lower leg of the figure is also partially broken, and there are chips across the upper legs particularly along the right knee. The edges of the base are also badly damaged at the corners. The object has been attached to a tall rectangular modern base.
