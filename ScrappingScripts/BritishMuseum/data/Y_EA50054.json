{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA50054"], "Description": [" Fragment from a limestone figure of the king Ramses I, only part of the back-pillar now remaining. What survives of the back-pillar records part of the titulary of the king, known as the Horus name, in a single column of text. The outer edges of the back-pillar are preserved on the right side, and on the left side are the smoothed edges of the stone between the back-pillar and partial outline of what was likely a figure. The corners at the top of the back-pillar have been damaged, and the obverse of the stone figure is now lost. There are small chips to the stone around the inscribed area, however the text is still discernible.
