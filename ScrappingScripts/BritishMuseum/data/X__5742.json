", " This motif is not listed in Gorton 1996, but the cross-shaped sign is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). It is usually seen as a debased hieroglyphic sign (see examples in Gorton 1996, 105-106, type XXVIII C). This scaraboid is closer to Gorton's type XXVIII B than XXVIII C, since the stamped motif is not arranged in register composition.
