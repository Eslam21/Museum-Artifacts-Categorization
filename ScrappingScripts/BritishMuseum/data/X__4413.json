This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The early excavations at Naukratis provided many bronze figures of Osiris. Some of them originated from a cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city: it contained nineteen statuettes of Osiris, twelve of which were complete (Petrie 1886, 41-42). Osiris is by far the most represented deity in the corpus of bronze figures from Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). Bronzes representing Osiris, as well as the other members of the Osirian triad - Isis and Harpokrates, are conspicuous in Late Period and Ptolemaic bronze votive deposits all over Egypt (see for example the large caches from North Saqqara where members of the Osirian triad represent three quarter of the bronze figures: Emery 1970, 6). The Osirian cult is important in the saite nome, and particularly in Sais itself as stressed by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 445), but also on a more local scale (Masson 2015). This figure belongs to the type 81 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a type that is found on various sites of the Delta, such as Sais, Herakleion, Bubastis, Athribis, Saqqara, Memphis, Tanis, and notably in Late Period contexts (Weiss 2012, 171-172, 627-633, Pl. 22b-i, Typ 81, esp.
