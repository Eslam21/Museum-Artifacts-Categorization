It opens with the full titulary of the king, followed by the introduction of Tiy. Whether or not this scarab series was released because of his marriage to Tiy, it was without doubt dedicated to the glory and honour of the queen. Such a high social position for the great royal wife was unprecedented, but the idea was adopted and developed further during the Amarna Period."}
