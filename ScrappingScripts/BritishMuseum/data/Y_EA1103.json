On either side of the inscription appears a scene in which Amenhotep II is depicted making an offering to Amun-Ra who is seated on a throne before two altars on each of which is a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. In the scene on the left the figure of the king and the altars have largely been lost. The relief is well preserved apart from extensive loss on the left side and slight damage to the right edge.
