This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The sherd belongs to the same vase as Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.50.1894 and probably belongs to the same vase as GR.49.1894. Lemos describes the sherd as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration. Williams prefers to see parallels with the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl and suggests that the sherd is closely related to the bowl. He believes also that the painter for this vessel was responsible for British Museum 1888,0601.475.g, 1888,0601.475.d and 1924,1201.115.
