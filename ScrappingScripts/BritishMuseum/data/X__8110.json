", " Teardrop, or ovoid, weights are rare in Naukratis as in Egypt in general (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 26, fig. 8, fig. 13 and fig. 26). They appear to be more numerous in the New Kingdom than in later periods (Cour-Marty 1990, fig. 26). These weights are usually associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet around 9g, or to lighter unit around 8g which could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). In the case of this weight, its state of conservation does not allow identifying properly the standard used. However, the fact that it is made of a light painted material - maybe to copy some hard heavier stones, it is possible that this is a false weight, made to deceive customers.
