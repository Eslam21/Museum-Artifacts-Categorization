Moulds to produce lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1896,0610.16 and BM 1896,0610.17. Numerous couchant lion scaraboids were discovered in Naukratis (see for example the ones illustrated in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, nos. 50, 64, 69, 80, 92, 99, 104). Lion scaraboids usually bear on the underside either the name of the god Amun/Amun-Ra often written in a cryptographic way, or an imitation of a royal name. This item displays a shortened version of the name of Psamtek, possibly referring to Psamtek II since part of the activity at the Scarab Factory happened during his reign. Petrie noted four attestations altogether, two from the Factory (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 80). This scaraboid belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B152-160, see especially B154 for this piece). A solar disc sign accompanies the name of Psamtek. The association of the solar disc with a lion (either for the shape of the scaraboid or depicted on the underside of scarabs) is very common in the Naukratite production. Scholars tend to interpret this as a way to write the name of Ra during the Late Period, as the lion is a phonetic equivalent Rw (De Wit 1951, 138ff).
