", " Schlotzhauer (in Weber and Schlotzhauer) identifies the sherd as coming from either a Wild Goat Style or Mature Animal Style chalice or kotyle. Since kotylai are not typical of Chian fine ware of this period, the sherd presumably comes from a chalice or perhaps a kantharos. Filling ornament is typically found on Wild Goat and Mature Animal Style vases, but since it is not possible to determine precisely on what the bird is resting, we cannot rule out other suggestions such as architectural features. The acroteria on the Troilos chalice are depicted in similar fashion. The lack of interior decoration is synonymous with the Wild Goat Style. However, given the size of the sherd, it is possible that interior decoration featured on the chalice, but not on this part of the vessel. Schlotzhauer also compares the bird on this sherd with the water-bird on the W\u00fcrzburg chalice, but a closer parallel might be the later black-figured kantharos from Emporio (Lemos 1991, no. 1626). Rim patterns feature strongly on both Wild Goat and Mature Animal Style vases. The lack of rim pattern decoration on this sherd should place this vessel later in the 6th century BC when Chalice Style vases, many of which have no rim pattern, appear.
