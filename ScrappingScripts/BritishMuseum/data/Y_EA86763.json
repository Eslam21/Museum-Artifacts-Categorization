{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86763"], "Description": [" Small but complete seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay with some mica inclusions was hardened after excavation. The rear shows two side with each two small coils of basketry suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The front shows a relatively large impression of an oval scarab-like seal with a circumferential line. A finger-impression covers most parts of the seal-impression. Recognisable are still a small nfr-sign on the right, maybe a t and a bird underneath, followed by a cobra or a plant?
