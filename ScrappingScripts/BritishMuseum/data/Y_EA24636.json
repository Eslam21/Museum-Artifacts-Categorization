{"artifact_name": "axe; ornament", "Object Type": [" axe ", " ornament "], "Museum number": ["EA24636"], "Description": [" Ornamental arsenical copper axe-head: the blade is well rounded. It lacks lugs but has three binding-holes. The openwork decoration, roughly done, is in the form of three papyrus plants, one erect in the middle, the others bent over on either side, on one of which sits a bird. The bird is in one piece with the plant on which it sits but is freed at the tail and head. The decoration is not flat but was hammered and bevelled to a rounded finish. There is no internal detail. The cutting edge was never sharpened and there is no sign of wear. The piece is moderately corroded and there is considerable pitting. "], "Cultures/periods": [" First Intermediate (?)
