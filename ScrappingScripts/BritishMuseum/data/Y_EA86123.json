{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA86123"], "Description": [" Part of the base of a vessel made of calcite. The base is very thick walled and heavy, suggesting a closed shape but the highly polished surface of the interior suggests an open shape like a bowl. The rim is broken off and the side walls are very thin compared to the base. The shape of the vessel is tapered towards the base. The surface of the base is less well smoothed than the outer and inner interior.
