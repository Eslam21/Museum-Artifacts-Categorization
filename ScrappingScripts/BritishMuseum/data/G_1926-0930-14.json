{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.14"], "Description": [" Terracotta squatting female figure. A seated woman, a beneficent demon, with arms upraised in blessing and protection. She has her knees widely spread and the soles of her feet touch. The mould was very worn and the details are indistinct. Her hair was probably drawn to a bun at the back; there are no piercings at ear level. She is clothed in a short tunic and wears cabled bracelets and plain anklets. The back is summarily treated, but her drapery is indicated. A small hole pierced underneath may be a firing-vent, but seems to have been enlarged in modern times to mount the object on a stand. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface; traces of an all-over white dressing.
