Papyrus written on the recto in linear hieroglyphic script and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains a magical text, possibly with spells for gaining respect from men, while on the verso there is a (later) accounting text. The text on the recto is written in vertical lines, possibly in retrograde script. This frame contains Fragment B. The papyrus was a half-height roll. Gardiner described P. Ramesseum 7 as follows: 'Under this head are grouped two large fragments (A, recto, Pl. XXII; B, recto, Pl. XXIII; the versos, Pl. XXVII) and a number of smaller ones mounted between nine pairs of glasses. The rectos of these latter are reproduced in Pl. XXIV-XXVI. All these pieces are written in cursive hieroglyphs and in vertical columns, and it is not impossible that they all emanated from one and the same manuscript. Though externally of an appearance similar to that of P. Ram. V and VI they differ in having only one framing-line at the top instead of two. Another point of difference is that whereas P. Ram. V and VII are inscribed on one side only, many of the fragments classed as P. Ram. VII have some coarse hieratic writing on the verso, this, however, so much broken and so faint that only a word or two are decipherable here and there, see further below. To return now to the recto, the contents here, so far as recognizable, are all magical, but with a greater admixture of mythical allusion than is usual elsewhere' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 10). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
