{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86915"], "Description": [" Very small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a small concave surface with organic impression (wood or leather?). In the break two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.2 cm. The upper side is slightly convex with some finger imprints next to the seal. The lower two thirds of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible on the top. Recognisable are two stylized standing figures holding a staff between them. The figure on the left is probably Re-Harakhte and the one on the right Amun. Both are positioned on top of a standing line. The same motif can be found on EA86902 and EA86911. The style is very similar to the motif of EA86792, EA86793, EA86799, EA86800, EA86801, EA86802 and EA86812.
