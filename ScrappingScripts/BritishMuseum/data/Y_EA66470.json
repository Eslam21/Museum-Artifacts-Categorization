Gorton identified the motif as a debased inscription, possibly mentioning the name men-ib-Ra - which should be corrected in Menekhib, the Horus name of Psamtek II - or wah-ib-Ra (Gorton 1996, 106). This debased inscription could also be a play between the name of the god Amun-Ra written in a cryptic way (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) and the name of the pharaoh Wahibre, likely to be Apries since the activity of the 'Scarab Factory' is mainly dated to 600-570 BC. Petrie illustrated a number of different versions for this type of inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 65-70).
