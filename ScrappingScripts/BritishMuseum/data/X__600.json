", " Cypro-Ionian style alabaster tripod bowls come in two forms, one with lion\u2019s feet (Montreal, Redpath Museum 2532.02; 2532.01) and three fragments with sphinxes (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1508; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.88.45; 86.168; Eg.Inv.458). The second group were likely used as containers for cosmetics or toiletries vessels and have been dated 550-525BC (H\u00f6ckmann 2007, N37, 190-191, type 5, style group 4). A broader date range of 575-525BC is suggested for the former group. The basin's form has been attested according to other examples to belong to the Ionian area (Smith 1892, no.116; Conze 1895, 106; Bulle 1900, 35; von Fritz 1894a, 74; von Fritz 1894b, 733; Perrot and Chipiez 1903, 336; Weicker 1902, 126; Belin de Ballu 1972, 43-44; Floren 1987, 409; Wild 1988, 426). A parallel from Olbia suggests that all examples had identical tripod legs and likely also a lid (H\u00f6ckmann 2007, 190-191). One example was found in late Saite levels within the sanctuary of Aphrodite (context \u03a68; Boston RES.88.45), the others do not have secure contextual information. ", " An example of this type, in limestone with alternating lion's paw feet and spoolhandles (3 each), has been found in a Lydian child's grave at the village of Tekelio\u011flu K\u00f6y\u00fc near Manisa, with a suggested date in the last quarter of the 6th century BC: Mitten, D.G. and Y\u00fc\u011fr\u00fcm, G., \u201cExcavations at Ahlatl\u0131 Tepecik on the Gygean Lake, 1968\u201d, T\u00fcrk arkeoloji dergisi, 17,1.1968, 17.1, 125\u2013131, esp. 127 , 131 figs 9-10.
