Close parallels from Thonis-Herakleion were dated to the 6th\u20138th century AD (Goddio and Fabre 2008, 298 no. 44); however, this group comprises collected damaged jewellery of various dates gathered for recycling. Earrings of this type are depicted on contemporary Roman mummy portraits (Borg 1996, 171, pls. 78:1, 79:1), but derived from much earlier precedents (Pisano 1987, 80).
