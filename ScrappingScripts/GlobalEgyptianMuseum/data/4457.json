The mummy is short in length, the outer shroud held in place by narrow retaining bandages, the area about the head is much disturbed. The jawbone is exposed on the left-hand side.The mummy is the wrapped skeleton of a very old man, all the bones show evidence of advanced senile osteoporosis. There is also evidence of some spinal arthritic changes, also in the left knee. There is a fracture in the region of the surgical neck of the right humerus and in view of the absence of any other fractures it may be assumed that it occurred a very short time before death."}
