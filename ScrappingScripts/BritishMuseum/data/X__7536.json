", " Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export throughout the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie listed a number of variants for scarab-moulds such as this piece (Petrie 1886, 36-37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-5). This example was discovered along several moulds during Hogarth\u2019s excavation in 1903. According to Hogarth\u2019s list of antiquities from that year (list of Box 1), it originated from the Hellenion area. Hogarth actually referred to North East town, including the Hellenion and an industrial area to the East. Could that be evidence for a second workshop in that area? These moulds do not differ from the ones discovered in the Scarab Factory area. Gorton, A.
