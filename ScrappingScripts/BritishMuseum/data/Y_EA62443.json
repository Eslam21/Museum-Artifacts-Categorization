{"artifact_name": "necklace; bead; amulet", "Object Type": [" necklace ", " bead ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA62443"], "Description": [" Part of a necklace: the amulets consist of a crouching man in blue glazed composition and a pair of semi-translucent calcite testicles (?). Of the two crumb beads, both long convex bicones, one has lost most of its crumbs but the other is decorated with light-blue crumbs on a dark-blue, almost black surface. The other glazed composition beads, all green or blue, are a fancy moulded long cylindrical bead, three plain long cylindrical beads with wide boring, a vase-shaped bead pierced for stringing through its length, and a very thin disc bead with wide diameter and narrow piercing. The three shells are filed examples of 'Nassa'. The string is completed by one large translucent light-brown quartz oblate bead and long and short cylinders and barrels of cornelian, feldspar and green glazed steatite.
