{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "E72:80", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "JAR LABEL", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Width": "11.5 cm", "Name": "Wine-jar sherd with hieratic inscription", "Description": "Wine-jar sherd with contents noted in the cursive or 'hieratic' script. The hieratic text identifies the contents of the jar as wine of the 29th year of a reign. Few kings ruled so many years, and it seems likely that the unnamed monarch is Amenhotep III, who was on the throne for 37 years. Large numbers of labelled wine jars from his reign survive from his palace at Malqata on the Theban West Bank, and from the city of his son Akhenaten at El -`Amarna."}
