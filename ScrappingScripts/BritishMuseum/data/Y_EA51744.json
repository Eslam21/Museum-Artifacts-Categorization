{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA51744"], "Description": [" 17 small pottery sherds from two black ware bowls, of an open form with a flat base. The deoxidised fabric is very fine and contains no organic temper; lots of large sand particles, some scattered tiny black and grey stones, and tiny pieces of mica. It is decorated on the exterior with impressed wedge-shaped stamps in geometric cross-hatched patterns. These are filled with white and red pigment. The rim in burnished, and the cross-hatched squares are separated by lines of burnishing. A hole is visible in one sherd, which may suggest it was used for suspension or broken and then repaired. Some burnishing on interior.
