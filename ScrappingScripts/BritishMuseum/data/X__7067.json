{"artifact_name": "juglet", "Object Type": ["juglet"], "Description": [" A souvenir pottery juglet in the form of a human head, probably of Saint Menas. Its neck rising from the crown of the head and a handle from the shoulder. Large nose and wide painted eyes, a dimpled chin, and hair across the forehead and flanking the face, the hair is indicated by vertical striations. The top of the head tapers up to a rim with a double-moulded edge, and the vessel stands on a flaring foot, now damaged. A handle extends from the mouth to the back of the head. Two-piece mould, or made in two parts, with an applied handle. The eyes are painted red-brown and white, and there is black on the mouth and hair; a band around the rim is red and there is red colour on the mouth. It is not clear whether the colours are post-firing pigments or are fired-on ceramic colours. dle. Pale-orange to buff fabric with very fine dark grey/ black inclusions, some red inclusions, quartz and some white grits.

", " The fabric resembles pieces from Abu Mina, which appears to be confirmed by the presence of an identical vessel (but different mould-series), identified as an ampulla in the form of St Menas' head and dated 480 to 650 AD (Bailey 2008, 3405; GR 1982,0402.9). Comparanda cited by Bailey have been found at Abu Mena (Kaufmann 1908: 208, fig. 164:7 and 8; Kaufmann 1910: 124, figs 67 and 69; and 129, fig. 72), Alexandria (Pagenstecher 1913: 95, fig. 109:3, pl. xl:6; Kiss 1991: 116; Parandowski 1990: 304, fig. 1:A and D, 6th century AD Kom el-Dikka contexts), Canopus (Breccia 1926: pl. xxxvii:5, dated very late or Coptic), Memphis (Petrie Museum uc48552; Petrie et al. 1910: pl. xliv:170, purchased) and unprovenanced (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1872.1078; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, e.9.1963; Fjeldhagen 1995: no. 200, dated sixth century AD; Gabold 1990: 232, no. 0238; Pagenstecher 1913: pl. xl:8). Earlier dates have been suggested for a parallel from Hadra cemetery, Alexandria, dated to the Ptolemaic period (Breccia 1930, pl.29.6, no.408, Alexandria 22447; Perdrizet 1921, 368, pl.47) and from a tomb near Gaza and from Alexandria, dated late 5th century BC (sic) (Skupinska-L\u00f8vset 1978: nos UT 18 and 19).
