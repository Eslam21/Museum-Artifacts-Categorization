{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "752", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "GLASS", "Technique": "GLASS-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "3.7 cm", "Name": "Statuette of Sapair", "Description": "This is a rare example of Egyptian glass statuettes. It represents a man sitting on a throne with a high back, his arms rest on his knees. He wears a long garment, short wig covering his ears and wide collar. On the back of the throne there is a vertical column of incised gilded hieroglyphs: \"Sapair, true of voice\". A complexity of technology made glass statuettes a luxury and, probably, they were manufactured only in royal workshops; at least most of them represent kings. Our piece may be stylistically dated to the late Eighteenth Dynasty."}
