{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1914:217", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "EL-SHEIKH `ABADA/ANTINOOPOLIS", "Category": "HAIRPIN", "Material": "BONE", "Name": "Bone hairpin", "Description": "Plain bone hairpin. Common in rich predynastic tombs, but not in the Pharaonic Periods, the hairpin again became an item of costume in the Roman Period. This late Roman example comes from the only city founded in Egypt by the Romans, Antinoopolis in Middle Egypt, created by the emperor Hadrian at the site where his lover Antinous drowned in AD 130. In the Byzantine period the city was capital of the province of Upper Egypt, and therefore at the forefront of changes in material culture."}
