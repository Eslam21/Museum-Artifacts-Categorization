{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA845"], "Description": [" Lower section of a limestone naophorous statue of Hori, with a shrine featuring the image of the god Ptah. Hori wears a long pleated garment that covers his legs. He is shown kneeling and resting on his heels, and on his feet he wears sandals. His arms extend out in front of him to support a tall naos shrine with the image of the god Ptah. The god is identifiable via his mummified form, skullcap and the was sceptre he holds in both hands. The top, edges and front of the naos are inscribed with text that provides the name and titles of Hori and some of his family members. On the left side of the naos are four columns of text that include a dedication to the goddess Hathor, while on the right side of the naos is a relief figure of Hori\u2019s son. On the reverse of the statue is a slim back-pillar with a column of incised text that is left undefined by a border at its end. The upper portion of the text is now lost. In addition to the loss of Hori\u2019s upper body the surface of the stone is heavily pitted, and there are a number of small abrasions across the front of the naos, back-pillar, and round the statue base. The statue is now supported on a slim modern base.
