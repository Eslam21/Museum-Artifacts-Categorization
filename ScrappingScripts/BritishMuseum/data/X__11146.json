", " From a Ptolemaic context (3rd to 1st century BC), but from an earlier figure, probably an early Ptolemaic figure plaque of Isis-Hathor, with a parallel from Tell Atrib. Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late Period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Closest parallel from Naukratis is NA579 from Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (MCA), though there are many variants on this theme from Naukratis. Parallels are generally dated to the Late period and early Ptolemaic periods. Thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.109, nos. 203-9, particularly no. 206 from Memphis; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, pl. 50.1-5, nos 263-7, particularly no. 266; Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie 1909, pl. 35.11; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69:3). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 clear with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos. 1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and the Temple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Armana (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos. 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888,0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the SCA (unpublished).
