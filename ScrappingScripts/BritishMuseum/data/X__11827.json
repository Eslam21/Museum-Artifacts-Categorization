XXXVIII, no. 177). The inscription could start with \"beloved of Amun\" (as a possible parallel for the inscription: Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 256 , pl. 33, no. 325). The scarab Egyptian Museum in Cairo JE33593.6 seems very similar to that one according to the description on the museum's registers. However, the scarab JE33593.6 was discovered by Hogarth in 1899 and is slightly different from Petrie's drawing. The fact that two scarabs presents a similar inscription could possibly indicate a local production. This suggestion cannot be confirmed in the absence of photographs for both scarabs.
