The vessel has a cylindrical neck with flaring mouth rising from the pig's back; a spout, again slightly flaring, forms the animal's nose. The body was thrown on the wheel and the round base turned, then several details were applied: the neck of the flask, the feet, the ridged mane, the eyes, the ears and the tail; the eyes were additionally marked by pressing a hollow rod into the soft clay. Covered in white slip. Yellow-brown calcaric marl fabric.

Most parallels have been dated Hellenistic to Roman (Fjeldhagen 1995: no.193), from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC48325and UC65094), and unprovenanced (von Droste zu H\u00fclschoff 1980: pl. VIII: 81) and Naukratis (Bailey 2008, 3768-9), however this was found in a Saite period well fill sealed before 525BC and associated with artefacts dating c.610/600-570/560BC. The provenance is likely Cypriot, with similar vessles known from Cypro-Archaic and later contexts in Cyprus (British Museum GR1926,0419.4; GR1881,0824.77; GR1881,0824.76; Buchholz 1967).

XXXVIII, no. 6; see BM 1896,0610.17). Such amulets were related to ideas of fecundity (Andrews 1994, 35). This specific shape of vessel could therefore be well adapted to the cult of Aphrodite and relate by association to Egyptian beliefs. Andrews, C. 1994, Amulets of Ancient Egypt, London.
