{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86791"], "Description": [" Quite large part of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The rear shows one side with very clear impressions of two rows of basketry coil and another side with again two rows of basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side bears a deep impressed oval scarab-like seal and finger impressions. The motif shows a squatting Seth-animal, facing towards the left, in front of it very small hieroglyphic signs, a nfr on top of what looks like nb n, behind the head another sign, maybe a Hr? The rest is not recognisable anymore but there seems to have been a smaller sign behind the animal as well. Same motif as EA86796.
