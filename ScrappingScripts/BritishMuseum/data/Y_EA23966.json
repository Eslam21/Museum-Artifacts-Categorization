"], "Museum number": ["EA23966"], "Description": [" Fragment of a corroded iron artefact in the shape of a gently curved threaded rod stuck into a perpendicular item in the shape similar to a wing-nut . The interpretation of the item as part of a bridle-bit, as suggested by W.M.F Petrie, remains uncertain in spite of the similarity with the slightly larger item London, BM, EA 23965. If so, the rod should be interpeted as part of the cannon of the mouthpiece of the bit and the \"wing-nut\" as part of a shank.
