Between them stand two altars heaped with lotus-flowers. At the top of the stela are a curved sky-sign over a winged sun-disk, and eight columns of text containing a funerary invocation for the deceased.

His face is white with a black beak, black eye on yellow with blue and white adjuncts. The wig is blue, the collar yellow with blue edges, and the sceptres yellow and blue.
