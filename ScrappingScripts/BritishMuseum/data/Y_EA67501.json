{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA67501"], "Description": [" Bronze axe-head: the cutting edge is very lop-sided. It was once thickly corroded but has now been completely cleaned. There are small pits or faults on one face. The sides are roughly flanged, marks of the original hammering being plainly visible. Marks of some other, sharper-edged tool are also present on one of the sides and on one of the faces. The cutting edge shows signs of heavy wear and of having been reworked, a process which probably contributed to its uneven shape. Chased in one face is a crude representation of a boat, with central cabin, mast and sail and steering oar.
