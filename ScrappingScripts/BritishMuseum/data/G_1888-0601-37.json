Bone examples with this design are known from AD 79 contexts in Pompeii (Ward-Perkins and Claridge 1976, no 71b, f). Hair pins with full length figures tend to depict Venus, and are usually around 120-130mm long to cope with the elaborate hairstyles of the 1st century AD (Cool 2016, 37). Several small bronzes and \"pin-heads\" in form of figure of Aphrodite Anadyomene, alone or with Cupid, were discovered in Egypt: in Alexandria (BM 1926,0415.27) in Tell Atrib (Walters 1899, No. 1086), unknown site in Egypt (Walters 1899, No. 1096.1 and BM 1926,0415.55).
