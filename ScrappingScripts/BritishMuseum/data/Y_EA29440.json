The flat turquoise green underside bears in black the hieroglyphic text of Chapter 30B of the 'Book of the Dead', more often found on heart scarabs, which bound the heart to silence about its owner's misdeeds when it was weighed symbolically in the underworld. However, no owner is named. The separately inlaid red human face with striped wig can be considered to represent a personified heart. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 18th Dynasty (?) ", " 19th Dynasty (?)
