This is impossible as that temple was not yet discovered when this was excavated. Temple of Apollo is possiblem, but there are no object markings or register information to confirm this. Nick (2006, p.71) states that Aphrodite is not usually associated with lions. However, on Cyprus she can be equalised with Astarte, whose sacred animal is the lion.
