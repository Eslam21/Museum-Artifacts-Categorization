{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "35", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE; DIORITE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED", "Height": "31.5 cm", "Width": "19.7 cm", "Depth": "22.5 cm", "Name": "Squatting statue of Sobek-em-inu", "Description": "The man has a wig falling onto his shoulders and is wearing a short kilt. His legs are folded underneath him, and his left hand is placed on his chest. Unlike the typical statuary from the Old Kingdom, this man's self-image appears to be poor. Sobek-em-inu looks almost distressed, with his slightly upward glance. The expression of the broad mouth strengthens this impression. The strong musculature of the body is modelled according to the athletic ideal, but the posture is somewhat limp with its slightly drooping shoulders. It's almost as if the citizen depicted, who is part of a mighty centralized kingdom, is painfully aware of his social restrictions."}
