", " This decorated pendant could be a charm (for non-Greek stone charms: Petrie 1914, 32, pl. XXI no. 136). Naukratis yielded also several examples of undecorated amuletic pendant in smooth black stone. If a man is really depicted in the attitude of an orant with outstreached arms, then this pendant could possibly date to the Coptic period. But if it represents Bes surrounded by Phoenician letters, it should be much earlier in date. The letters inscribed on both sides held probably a magical meaning for the bearer of the pendant.
