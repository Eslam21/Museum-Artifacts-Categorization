This scarab belongs to a standard group produced at the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). It was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites and in south Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A1-18, see especially A17 for this specimen). The hieroglyphs in the \"half cartouche\", as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names (Gorton 1996, 93), and, in that case, Gorton suggested the inscription could stand more precisely for Wa-ib-re, the Horus name of Psamtek I or the name of Apries (Gorton 1996, 110).
