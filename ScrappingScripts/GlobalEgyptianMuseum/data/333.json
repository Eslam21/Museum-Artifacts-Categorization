The first stage was to rough out from a block of stone the approximate shape of the intended vessel. The interior was then bored out with the aid of a flint drill, and the exterior was carefully smoothed and polished. The Brussels vessel is distinctive by having two eyes and a nose, representing a human face, and by a conical foot. Examples of this type are rare and all come from tombs. As well as the practical purpose of containing provisions, these vessels also had the function of protecting the deceased in the Hereafter."}
