He was the third successor of Taharqa, who was the last Kushite king to also rule over Egypt. Senkamanisken still used titles based on those of Egyptian pharaohs, written in cartouches and he was buried in a Kushite-style pyramid in Nuri, where these foundation deposits were found. Foundation deposits were an important element of the foundation ritual, a series of ritual activities linked to each stage in the construction of any religious building, from fixing the plan and digging the foundation trenches to purifying the completed building. In theory, these rites were performed by the king, often with the aid of certain deities. Foundation deposits were buried at key points in the building plan, such as the corners of halls, courtyards, or shrines, along the main axis or processional route, and beneath some pylons, columns, or obelisks. Foundation deposits were intended to protect the building, and the items used include small votive plaques, bricks, model building tools or food offerings, ceramic vessels, and sometimes the head of a bull and a goose. As purely symbolic items, they were often made out of relatively simple materials, like faience, clay, wood, stone, or copper/ bronze, and were often uninscribed or simply stated the name of the king responsible for the building and the god to which it was dedicated.
