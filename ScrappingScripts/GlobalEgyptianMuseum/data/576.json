{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3822", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; PAINTED", "Height": "10.3 cm", "Depth": "5 cm", "Name": "Harpocrates with a lotus flower", "Description": "Harpocrates, the ultimate infant god, is represented naked, seated on a lotus seedbox with thick relief grains. He is standing against a large solar disk erected behind him. Adorned with the infant lock, he holds his right forefinger to his mouth and holds against himself, under his left arm, a round pot . On the seedbox, one can distinguish the bust of Sarapis emerging from the petals, flanked by Isis Thermouthis and by Sarapis Agathos Daimon under the guise of two serpents facing each other. This figurine symbolises in a classic fashion the rebirth of Harpocrates, which assured, every morning, the resurrection of the sun, and recalls on the other hand the underworld of the dead, represented by Sarapis and the two chthonian serpents."}
