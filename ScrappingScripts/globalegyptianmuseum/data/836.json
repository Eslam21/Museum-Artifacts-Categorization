This flint axe is clearly an imitation of a metal prototype from the Middle Kingdom. The artefact is completely bifacially retouched. The axe butt, formed by a straight truncation, is wider than the rounded cutting edge. The protrusions on the end were used to attach it to a handle. Such tools were mainly used for working wood, but sometimes only had a ceremonial function."}
