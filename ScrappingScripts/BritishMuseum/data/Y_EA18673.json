{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA18673"], "Description": [" A complete pottery amphora of Samian style a made in a coarse red silt fabric, with a small foot and rounded shoulder. The sides expand from the foot to the shoulder, then converge to a narrow, cylindrical neck, which is finished with a rounded, external rim. At either side of the neck is a loop-handle, extending from the neck to the shoulder. The fabric comtains much grit, especially small particles of quartz and flint. There are remains of a pale cream-yellow slip on the body, especially on the lower part. No doubt it once covered the whole vessel but much has been lost due to flaking of the surface, which shows visible evidence of lamination.
