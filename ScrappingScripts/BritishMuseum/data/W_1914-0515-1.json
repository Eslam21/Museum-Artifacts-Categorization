The stand consists of a tall cylindrical shaft engraved with foliate medallions and inscription friezes, with baluster on either end. The stand sits on a three-footed base with concave-faceted top with similar engraved foliate medallions. The object may be composite, although wear and corrosion suggests that the individual pieces have been together for some time.
