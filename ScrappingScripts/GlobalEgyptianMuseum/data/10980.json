The hairline disappears above the ears. The hairline on the forehead has been reworked with light cuts of an adze in order to change an original male type of straight hairline into the female cut which is parted in the middle. Despite the damage inflicted to the left side of the head, its traits are well-preserved. The long, narrow face with its severe, straight mouth has its eyes placed high in the skull."}
