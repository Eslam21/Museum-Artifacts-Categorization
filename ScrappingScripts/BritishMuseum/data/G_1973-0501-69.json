{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.69"], "Description": [" Terracotta squatting naked pregnant female figure with legs raised on each side to expose her genitals: she holds her left leg up with her left hand and indicates her pubic area with her right hand. She looks straight ahead; her hair is parted in the centre and she wears a tightly bound wreath. There is summary working on her back. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with an orange to grey core; traces of an overall white dressing, painted dark pink at one point. There also appears to be application of colouring, possibly fired-on, before the white coating was used: maroon on the belly, forehead and nose, black on the hair, eyebrows and pubic area.

GR1973,0501.68 seems to be from the same mould as figure NA516 in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology.Naukratis is the most likely find spot and production place for these objects, based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% are from Naukratis). Close parallels from Naukratis (Ashton et al. 2004, no. 93, wrongly ascribed to Antinoopolis (?) and so wrongly dated 1st to early 2nd century AD) and a c.300 BC context at Athribis (My\u015bliwiec and Bakr Said 1999, 214, fig. 25d). Similar examples from Egypt (Van Wijngaarden 1958, no. 78; Weber 1914, no. 271 and 273) have been dated to the Ptolemaic period (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 187, 3rd to mid 2nd century BC; Fischer 1994, no. 832, late Ptolemaic(?) = Vogt 1924, pl. 101: no. 3; Fjeldhagen 1995, no. 112, late Ptolemaic to early Roman) at Memphis (Smith et al. 1983, 88 pl. 6a, Temple A) and the Roman period in Middle Egypt, (Besques 1992, no.
