{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1905,0612.5"], "Description": [" Marble figure of a powerful muscular male cat pouncing, with front paws with claws extended resting on a twisted bird. One forepaw on duck or goose(?). The head, tail, bottom of the back legs and most of base has broken off. The rear left leg has a sharp ridge, whilst the rear right has flatter muscle. The marble is a fine grained white marble with mica, possibly Pentelic marble from the Penteliko Mountain near Athens. Traces of Egyptian blue paint on the chest of the bird. Most of the surface of this sculpture is covered with the marks of the claw chisel, and the sculptor has left several areas of the group unfinished. The area around the groin has been carved using the running drill technique, but the sculptor has left the marks of the holes that were drilled initially. This technique has also been used to separate, albeit only slightly, the bodies of the cat and the bird at the front, and where the cat\u2019s right leg holds the bird down. There are also signs of the use of the running drill around the tail and rump. Apart from leaving the evidence of chisel and drill work in various areas, the sculptor has modelled some parts of the group in a rather summary manner. At the front of the cat\u2019s chest, the surface has been cut back sharply to accommodate the bird\u2019s body, and this surface has been only roughly finished. The genitals are only sketchily covered with drill holes present, suggesting that the sculpture was unfinished. Behind the bird, the cat\u2019s body rests on a lump of coarsely worked marble, that is perhaps intended to be a rock. On the right side of the group, the cat rests its right leg on a block of marble that corresponds with the bird\u2019s body, but no attempt has been made to model the bird. This must be the back of the group. The plinth survives at the front of the group, stretching as far back as the end of the rock on which the bird and cat rest. The surface is weathered, particulaly the back of the group, giving it a dark yellow colour, with many dark brown patches. There are a few scratches on the top of the cat\u2019s body. Missing: the head, most of the tail and the two rear, lower legs. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Hellenistic"], "Production date": ["332BC - 200BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Egypt (?)

Part of a group of 20 cat sculpture fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance (Petrie Journal 26/11/1895; Petrie Notebook 21.4 1896-97). Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin (Greek & Roman Department letter no.755 8/06/1905 and no.756 16/07/1904). They were exhibited by Petrie in 1897. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Another parallel, Museum of Agriculture, Cairo, inv.601, was acquired from the Cairo dealer Khawam who provided a dubious Boubastis provenance. It is unlikely have been made by the same sculptor as the British Museum and Cairo Naukratis group. Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria. 1905,0612.4 and 1905,0612.5 were probably made by the same sculptor as both have the same carving style, subject and pose: that of a powerful, muscular, alert cat in an active pose with similar rendering of detail, sharply cut groin and stretched back leg (unlike other cats that are more rounded and less powerful, relaxing). 1905,0612.5 is slightly larger and more muscled than 1905,0612.4, but animals were often offered as pairs and may have been intended as such. Like most of the other marble cats in this series, this group is covered with the marks of the claw chisel, and the sculptor has left several areas of the group unfinished. Stragely the unfinished back of the group is the most severely weathered side, (we would expect it to have been the least exposed side to the elements) and the surface of this piece is generally weathered more severely than that of GR1905.6-12.4, giving it a darker yellow colour, with many dark brown patches. The bird appears to be a representation of a goose. All the birds represented in the British Museum Naukratis cat sculpture group were covered with traces of Egyptian blue plaint. Geese in the Late Period were commonly sacrificed for Horus, son of Isis, representing the symbolic destruction of the enemy (Junker 1910, 69-79; Wildung 1977; Graindorge 1996, 89-91; Bouanich 2005, 151), as represented in contemporary third century BC depictions of Harpokrates (Horus) strangling a fox-goose (British Museum GR 1845,0705.1; Ridgway 2006: 645 fig. 1; Schollmeyer 2003; 2007). Geese were also sacrificed during the festival of Isis in Alexandria and Philadelphia (Dunand 1973, 76; P. Cair. Zen. IV.59560; BGU VII.1501) and for the empress Arsinoe Philadelphos (P. Oxy. 27 2465; Schorn 2001, who was likened to Aphrodite and Isis). Bouanich, C. 2005. Mise \u00e0 mort rituelle de l\u2019animal, offrande carn\u00e9e dans le temple \u00e9gyptien, in S.
