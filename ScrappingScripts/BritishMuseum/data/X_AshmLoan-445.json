This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " For a parallel regarding the horse, see British Museum 1888,0208.70.a from Tell Dafana. The sherd possibly belongs to the same vase as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.130.9. The fabric of AN1896-1908-G.130.9 was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the fabric found great similarities with the fabric from Wild Goat Style sherds found at Bayrakli in Asia Minor, which Dupont had attributed production to Clazomenae. Based on the similar composition types, Dupont then suggested that the place of production for this sherd ought to be situated near Clazomenae, Erythrae, or Teos (Boardman 1986, 664). If AN1896-1908-G.130.5 does belong to the same vase as AN1896-1908-G.130.9, it must have the same production centre.
