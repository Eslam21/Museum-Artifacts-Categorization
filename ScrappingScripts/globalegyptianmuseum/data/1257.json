The lateral sides and the rear side of the chair carry hieroglyphic inscriptions which inform us of the identity of the owner. It is Neferouben, who exercised the important role of vizier under the reign of Tuthmosis III. The character is also known from a second statue preserved at the Boston Museum and from two canopic jars. It is probable that the Brussels statue comes from Memphis, which could indicate that Neferouben was one of the first viziers of Lower Egypt, a role created at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty,"}
