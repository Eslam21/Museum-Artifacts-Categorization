{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Torso of alabaster male figure (kouros).Only the torso, from the waist to just above the knee, survives. On the outside of the right thigh the contact point of the right arm with the hand remains, the penis is lost, and the surface is very damaged with dirt and rust-coloured marks found in grooves.The torso is slim, strongly reduced above the onset of the thighs; it must have been fairly short as the onset for the upper body starts immediately below the break. The underbelly is slightly protruding and is drawn in around the waistline. The inguinal ligament almost reaches the sides; the buttocks is small and rounded. The thighs are long and slender, their cross-section is oval; the outline of the left thigh is almost straight on the back. The wrist is slender; the left hand is closed.
