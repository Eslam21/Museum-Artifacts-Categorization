Such \u2018Asiatic\u2019 looking male figurines date to between the mid 7th to late 6th centuries BC, with very close parallels from Cyprus, probably from Arsos workshops (Karageorghis 1995, 19-21, Type I(ii)38. pl. 9.3). Karageorghis argues the \u2018Assyrian\u2019 look may coincide with Assyrian domination of Cyprus during the seventh century BC (1995, 21).
