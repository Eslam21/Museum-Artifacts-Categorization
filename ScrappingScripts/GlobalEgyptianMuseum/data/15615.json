{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 1412", "Dating": "6TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "FALSE DOOR", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "116 cm", "Name": "False Door of Pepi-Seneb", "Description": "The false door started to appear in Egyptian tombs after the Third Dynasty. It was a dummy communication door so that the Ba and Ka, the soul and guardian spirit of the dead, could always be in contact with the world of the living and receive offerings and hear prayers. This false door has a cavetto cornice, a cornice with a concave molding having a quarter circle curve. Below, in the window, a scene shows the royal scribe Pepi-Seneb sitting at an offering table heaped with offerings. On the lintel, the horizontal stone above the door, the Hetep-di-nisw formula of the offerings is written to allow the dead to receive eternal offerings. Pepi-Seneb is holding a long staff as a sign of nobility. He wears a short wig, a kilt, and a collar."}
