", " If the identification is correct, this figure belongs to a group of sow amulets relatively common in Naukratis. Sow amulets are associated to ideas of fecundity and to the sky-goddess Nut. They start to be popular with the Third Intermediate Period, though they were already produced in the Late New Kingdom: (Herrmann et al. 2010, no. 4) and are common during the Late Period (Andrews 1994, 35, fig. 32; Germond 2005, no. 6-7; Herrmann et al. 2010, 94). Sow amulets from Naukratis present usually a very schematic design, like this example.
