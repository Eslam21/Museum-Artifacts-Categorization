The body lies in the lower half of a brightly painted cartonnage coffin and was unwrapped in 1851, the bandaging roughly replaced. The local paper reported on the unwrapping, recording that there were no less than 280 yards of bandage around the body. The arms and legs were not wrapped separately but were covered in several folds of linen, more than twenty scarves (of which six were fringed) were used to pad the body and attain a more rounded appearance.The exposed face reveals that the body was covered in a thick layer of resin, which has turned black. The head still lies in the remains of the mask that originally covered the face, the laces that were used to close the cartonnage before it hardened are clearly visible on the X-ray. "}
