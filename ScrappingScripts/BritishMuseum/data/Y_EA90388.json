It is now clear that they form a coherent group of important figurines, probably produced locally already in the Late Period and into Roman times. Many examples from Naukratis are made in limestone and terracotta, with a few specimens in faience, such as this one. When made out of faience and of small size, they could be worn as an amulet (Herrmann et al. 2010, 67, type 32).
