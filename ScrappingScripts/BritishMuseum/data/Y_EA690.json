{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA690"], "Description": [" Upper part of a round-topped limestone stela depicting four Osiride statues of Mentuhotep II and Amenhotep I flanking an offering-table in shallow raised relief. The scene is topped by a winged sun-disc; just below are four cartouches bearing the titles of Amenhotep I, which pertain to the two statues on the left, who both wear the white crown of Upper Egypt, and the foremost statue on the right, who wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. In front of the statue on the far right, who wears the red crown of Lower Egypt, is the cartouche of Mentuhotep II. Each of the statues stands against a tall, round-topped back pillar, except for the right-hand statue, possibly because the artist ran out of space at the edge of the stela. Although the statues are mummiform in style, they are actually depicted wearing sed-festival (jubilee) cloaks, which terminate at the knee. All of the statues wear divine false beards, except for the left-hand figure. On the central table are four unusual offering stands, with two further stands with two lotus flowers between each pair of statues. Before the face of each statue is a lotus flower on a tall stem. Significant traces of paint remain: red on the red crowns and sun-disc, blue on its wings, the cartouches in yellow, red-brown on skin and offering table, and red outlines for the statues\u2019 back pillars. The lower half of the stela is broken and it sits on a restored base. A crack runs diagonally across the stela with chips missing at the top on the right-hand side and just below the cartouches, where the damaged hieroglyph \u2018mn\u2019 can still be read.

Tiradritti (ed.), Pharaonic renaissance, Ljubljana 2008, p. 177 The royal statues depicted on this stela bear a strong resemblance to those found at the temple of Mentuhotep II at Deir el-Bahri, one of which, a mummiform statue of Amenhotep I, is now part of the British Museum collection (EA 683). This type of Osiride statue was first introduced at the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II. The combination of the Osiride features and sed-festival (jubilee) robe are also found on a seated statue of this king now in the Cairo Museum (JE 36195). The identification of the king with Osiris was intended to aid his resurrection in the afterlife. While the deceased king had long been associated with both the sun god Ra and Osiris, the ruler of the Afterlife, the focus of mortuary belief in the Old Kingdom seems to have centred more on the solar aspects and the Middle Kingdom marked a shift towards Osirian funerary practices. Because Mentuhotep II achieved the reunification of Egypt after a period of civil war, many later kings sought to associate themselves with him by placing their statues at the site of his mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Some of these were executed in a style similar to that used for the statues of Mentuhotep II himself. New statues of Mentuhotep II were also dedicated in the New Kingdom (e.g. EA 53890).
