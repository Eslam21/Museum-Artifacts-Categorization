He was \"overseer of funerary priests\" and \"maker of the flagellum\". In his otherwise rather simple tomb, more than a dozen statues were found in 1913. The number of statues reflects the wish to be provided with as many statues as possible for the reception of offerings for an excellent afterlife, just as the king was.This uninscribed statue depicts Shepses-Ptah striding in the way usual for men. He is wearing a short echelon-curl wig and a knee-length kilt. The few remaining traces of paint on the statue follow the canonical colour palette."}
