{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "48.25.46", "Dating": "3RD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (not before); LATE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FAYENCE; PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "3.5 cm", "Name": "Amulet", "Description": "A small blue-grey glazed faience amulet of a striding ram, a symbol of virility. The face is fine but the body, striding with the left leg forward, is crude in comparison. This may represent the god Amun, the ram has the short, curling horns usually associated with this god. Definate attribution is difficult as there were several other ram-headed deities. There is a loop on the back for suspension."}
