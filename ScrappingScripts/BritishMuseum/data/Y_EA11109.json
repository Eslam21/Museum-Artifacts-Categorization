{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA11109"], "Description": [" Bronze standing figure of the goddess Maat with a tall feather and subtly indicated vulture headdress over a wig. A tang beneath the foot-plinth would have attached it to a base. There is a plumpness to the figure characteristic of the later Egyptian ideal female form, with a rounded face, prominent bust, and deep navel. The hands are held flat at the sides of the body and the feet are placed together. The long, clinging dress which the figure wears is only indicated by the ankle-length hemline.
