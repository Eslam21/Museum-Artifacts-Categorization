", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. Such amulets were common in the 25th dynasty (example dated to the Third Intermediate Period: Andrews 1994, 65, fig. 70b) and were popular on Nubian sites, such at Kawa. A few amulets discovered in Naukratis represent a ram, a ram-headed deity or, like for this specimen, a ram's head. They might be associated to the local cult of the ram-headed god Amun-Ra Baded, attested since the 26th Dynasty in Naukratis (Guermeur 2005, 126-138; Yoyotte 1982/83).
