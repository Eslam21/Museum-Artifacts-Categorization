{"artifact_name": "cylinder seal", "Object Type": ["cylinder seal"], "Museum number": ["89374"], "Description": [" Hematite cylinder seal; originally the design consisted of the king with a mace facing the suppliant goddess (with necklace counterweight, and chevron flounces on her robe). The space left for an inscription was filled by a couchant bull, facing left, on which stands a smiting weather god in ascending posture, facing right. There was no room for his left arm so it has been cut vertically to allow space for a nude goddess, and he seems to be holding weapons in each hand. Every remaining space has been filled with motifs: a hedgehog, a monkey and a \"bow-legged dwarf\" between the original figures; a lion-scimitar and a fly behind the weather god; a pot and a ball-and-staff alongside the nude goddess; chipped.
