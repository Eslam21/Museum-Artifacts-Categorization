Both humeral callosities are shown by a triangle. Head and eyes are visible, parts of the clypeus and both plates are broken off. The side shows three legs each in relief, no hairs indicated, on top of a base line that is only separated partly from the legs. The seal at the base is broken off in its upper third, it shows a circumferential line. An ibis-bird, with its feet as base line, the head is not preserved, facing to the right side. It stands in front of a cartouche, not legible anymore, but a seated deity in the uppermost preserved part. Perforated along its longitudinal side.
