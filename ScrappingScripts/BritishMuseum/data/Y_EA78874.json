The weave is plain, open and balenced. The spinning direction of warp and weft is 's'. The thread count is warp 6 per 10mm and weft 5 per 10mm (possibly reversed). Two patches are sewn on to the textile. The thread is visible only around the first patch. The thread is wool, natural-coloured and consists of 2 's'-spun elements, 'z'-plied. The first patch is natural-coloured brown and irregularly-shaped. The weave is plain and weft-predominant. The spinning direction of the warp is 's' and the weft appears almost unspun and is uneven. The thread count is warp 11 per 10mm and weft 22 per 10mm. The second wool patch (?) is natural and brown in colour with a thread count of warp 4 per 10mm and weft 7 per 10mm.
