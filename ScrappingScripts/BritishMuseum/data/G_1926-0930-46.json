{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.46"], "Description": [" Terracotta object in form of woman's head. The head and neck of a woman, and an entity in itself, with an elaborate 'melon' hairstyle, drawn back to a large plaited bun held by an encircling band. She wears ring-shaped earrings, each pierced through to the cavity within the head; a further piercing in the hair on the upper right side is presumably an unnecessary firing-vent. The eyes are blank and there is a decided curved groove across the neck. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with overall traces of a white dressing.
