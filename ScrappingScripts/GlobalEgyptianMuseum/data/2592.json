{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1913:333", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "EL-RIQQEH", "Category": "DISH", "Material": "CALCITE/ALABASTER ?", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "7 cm", "Name": "Duck dish", "Description": "Body of a cosmetic dish in Egyptian alabaster, the head separately carved and not now with the vessel. The cemetery where this was excavated lies near the villages of el-Riqqeh and Girza, not far from the Residence of the Middle Kingdom kings at Itjtawy (probably modern el-Lisht). The piece was found in the intact New Kingdom burial of a woman, whose body lay in a grave measuring 90 by 60 by 85 inches, the head to the east and the face turned to the north. The coffin was of pottery, and the grave-goods included another stone cosmetic dish, a stone snake-amulet, blue glass beads, a mirror, two gold penannular ear-rings, and a cowrie-shaped seal-amulet and scarab amulet. Together the group presents the items of adornment treasured by a relatively well-to-do lady of the late 18th Dynasty, when Egypt was at the peak of her power, about 1350 BC."}
