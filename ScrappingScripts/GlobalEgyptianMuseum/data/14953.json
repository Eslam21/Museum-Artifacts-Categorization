She wears a very beautiful tall wig and a long tight-fitting garment. She might have once held a scepter, as there is a hole in the right hand. In her left hand, the lady is holding the sistrum, or metal musical instrument or rattle. This probably means that she was a priestess of the cult of Hathor. The pedestal of this statuette once had hieroglyphic text written on it."}
