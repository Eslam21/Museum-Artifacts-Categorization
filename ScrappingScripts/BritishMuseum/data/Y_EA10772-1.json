Ramesseum 19, Frame 1. Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in hieratic script. The recto contains ritual/magical texts which continue on the verso. The text is written in horizontal lines. This frame contains twenty-two fragments, including a fragment of P. Ramesseum 19 (unmentioned and unpublished by Gardiner), a fragment of P. Ramesseum 3, lines A 5-8 (bottom right), a fragment of P. Ramesseum 4, lines Dv 1-2 (far right), and nineteen unidentified fragments. These fragments were first identified as part of a single papyrus and numbered 19 in 2006. This frame is labelled as 'P. Ram. Frags.'. The papyrus was probably a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
