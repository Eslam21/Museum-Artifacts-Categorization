The crossed arms are only slightly free of the body. The fists are visible but hold no tools. Eyes and brows were painted black. On the front are four carved lines of hieroglyphs. The layout suggests that the shabti was kept in its own coffin. The fine modelling of the figure and the shape of the hieroglyphs are reminiscent of the tradition of the Middle Kingdom."}
