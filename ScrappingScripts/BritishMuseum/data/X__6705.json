{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum D"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum D (P. Berlin 10495), Frame 4. Papyrus written on the recto in hieratic script. The recto contains an onomasticon. The text is written in numbered horizontal lines with the item's determinatives arranged in a separate sub-column. This frame contains three pages, with lines 183-216. These lines contain fortresses in Nubia and towns in Upper Egypt, listed with abbreviations (?) instead of determinatives. The papyrus was originally a half-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the rest are in the British Museum. The objects found with the papyri are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher. Images of P. Ramesseum D are \u00a9 \u00c4gyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Photographer: Lisa Baylis, the British Museum.
