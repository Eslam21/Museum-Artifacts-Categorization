{"artifact_name": "finger-ring; scarab", "Object Type": [" finger-ring ", " scarab "], "Museum number": ["EA14345"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring with steatite scarab bearing two cartouches of Sheshonq I. The scarab is rimmed with gold and set in a swivelling bevel, with a wire of gold passed through the bezel and wound around the hoop on both sides. The rim of the gold scarab mount is decorated with braid-style granulation. The hoop is stirrup-shaped rather than round and ends in cup terminations on either side of the bezel. The base of the scarab, which would have been used as a seal, is simply inscribed with the cartouches of Sheshonq I along a horizontal axis with no further decoration. The hieroglyphs are rough in form but lightly inscribed.

Petrie, \u2018Historical scarabs: a series of drawings from the principal collections arranged chronologically\u2019 (London, D. Nutt, 1889), p. 56. A similar scarab of Sheshonq I, with the order of the cartouches reversed, was recorded as part of UCL collection by Petrie (1917, pls. 49.11, 60.82). Another comparable scarab signet ring of Sheshonq I was part of the collection of Dr. James Grant, and was presumably donated to the Marischal Museum at the University of Aberdeen along with the rest of his collection (Newberry 1906, p. 185, pl. 37.8). The relatively uncommon, simple two cartouche-design inscribed along a horizontal axis can also be found on scarabs of 18th Dynasty King Thutmoses III and 23rd Dynasty King Pedubastis (Petrie 1917, pl. 28.117-19; Newberry 1906, pl. 37.10). Signet rings with swivelling bevels are known from the Middle Kingdom onwards. The seal is relatively simple, with much more blank space than is usual. There are no extra titulary or iconographic elements that are generally used as embellishment on other rings with the name of Sheshonq I. Bibliography: P.E.
