{"artifact_name": "incense-burner(?)", "Object Type": ["incense-burner (?)"], "Museum number": ["1960,1002.1"], "Description": [" Hollow terracotta object in form of head emerging from palm-capital. An object of uncertain use, with a socket apparently for the insertion of a wooden handle: probably an incense-burner, but ours has no signs of burning: this perhaps is not significant. The back is flat and plain, and the front depicts a female head with wavy hair parted in the centre and no attributes, except that the coils of hair on each side of the face below the ears might be truncated Isislocks. She wears ball earrings and her neck (forming the socket mentioned above) has three gadroons rising from a single moulding. Surmounting her hair is an oval opening with a raised rim. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown to red-brown surface. Minute traces of a white dressing, mainly on the front. At the back is a large patch of white, possibly plaster or a dressing, which may be modern; there are traces of a pink pigment on the patch.
