", " A rather close parallel was discovered in Herakleion: Goddio 2008, 259 and 312, No. 136. E. McCann precises that square lug handles are common on stone vessels of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (in Goddio 2008, 258). The mortar with its very characteristic handles resembles also dishes in slate typical of the Late Third Intermediate and Late Periods (mainly 25th and 26th dynasties according to Aston 1994, 164-165. For dishes from a late 26th-early 27th dynasty context in Karnak see: Anus and Sa\u2019ad 1971, 233, fig. 18; Masson forthcoming. For examples of the Third Intermediate Period from Herakleopolis Magna: Molinero 1995, 212, pl. LXIX j, pl. LXX g, pl. LXXI, pl. LXXVI). Such dishes however are usually finer in execution. Hogarth found two mortars in 1903, this one and Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4552. Both are mentioned in his diary: \u201cGranite shallow mortar\u201d uncovered on the 18th of April in a trench made in the area of the Hellenion, and, \u201c1 small mortar Eg[yptian]\u201d, discovered on the 2nd of May in the southern part of the site.
