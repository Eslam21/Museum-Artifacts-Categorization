A third, wearing a huge sabre (right), points with a gesture of menacing command to the 'Temple of Eunuch's' (right). Terrified Frenchmen are being pushed through the doorway by Turks, while a scowling Moslem priest stands by the door, a knife in his teeth. In the background a Frenchman is being strangled; the bodies of four others are bound to high posts, while serried ranks of Turkish soldiers stand on guard. Behind (left) is a massive Turkish fort with other buildings. 9 October 1798 Hand-coloured etching.
