", " The surfaces are very worn down, compared to the original published drawing (in Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 20). This small scarab belongs to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). It belongs to a type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites, and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A19-31, see especially A27 for this piece). Most signs are legible, but reading is difficult: the hieroglyphs are possibly only used here for their intrinsic magical value, as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). Similar inscribed scarab with no real sense to the inscription: BM 1886,0401.1670, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.868 and Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.12.
