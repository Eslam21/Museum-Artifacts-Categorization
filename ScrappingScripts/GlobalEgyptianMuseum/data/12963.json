{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "18577", "Dating": "SCORPION/SEREQ (not before); AY/KHEPERKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "15 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a royal family group", "Description": "The fragment is an upper part of a female figure from a family group. The right arm is stretched to the right to embrace the husband and a part of his embracing arm is seen below it. She wears a plain tripartite wig and a dress with its collar traced by a carved line around the neck. The face with large eyes, heavy eyelids and deepened ends of the mouth is characteristic of late Amarna and post-Aamrna portraits. Small but flabby breasts remind of the Berlin statuette of aged Nefertete. Another fragment of the group, the upper part of the figure of the king is in Musee d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva. The face with a grim smile inherited by the Amarna royal family from the queen Teje may well be that of Ay and, then, the Hermitage queen must be his wife Tii."}
