The wood has been covered with stucco on both sides, the decorated side is well smoothed.The upper registers are framed by a line border, in the arch is a winged sun-disk. The wings do not follow the curve of the stela but are painted lower and straighter instead. Beneath the disk are written the epithets 'The Behedite' and 'Great God'.The main scene shows the deceased on the right, kneeling and adoring three deities, two seated and one standing. The two seated figures are clear, Isis to the right and Nephthys to the left, both mummiform. On the far left appears to be the very faint outline of a third figure, standing and mummiform. The names of the deceased and Isis are crudely painted above the figures.The inscription consists of a shortened version of the htp-dj-nsw formula, it is damaged and many of the signs are difficult to read.Colours are indistinct but the deceased is depicted with a red body, as is Nephthys, traces of blue can be seen on Isis' headdress and the framing border is also blue.
