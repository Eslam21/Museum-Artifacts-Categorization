", " Crude limestone figure of reclining bearded male on couch, usually depicted drinking from a cup and covered with a decorated blanket are rare at Naukratis (Oxford AN1896-1908- G.1037; AN1896-1908-G.1038, AN1886.461) and without certain contextual information to provide information on date, meaning or function. Parallels of recliners and recliner groups from Sais are dated to the late 6th or early 5th century BC sympotic groups from Sais, (Daressy 1901, 230-239, esp. 234-235, pl. 1; Cairo JE 35185; Cairo JE 90242, exc. no.81; JE 90243, exc. no.82; JE 90244, exc. no. 83) and an unprovenanced example, dated 7th to 5th century BC (Dentzer 1982, 60, pl. 14 fig 83, Louvre E11741). These appear to be influenced by East Greek terracotta depictions of symposia from the late 6th to 5th century BC (Cambridge NA315 from Naukratis), but the reclining groups from Sais include female figures on couches, depicted similarly to the later types of Saite and Late Period \u2018concubine\u2019 figure plaques well known from Naukratis and other Delta sites (British Museum EA 1886,0401.1510, Type Thomas L-F.1.1), suggesting that they are contemporary. It is possible that this type influenced subsequent limestone reclining ithyphallic Harpocrates figures (British Museum GR 1965,0930.942, Type Thomas L.I.9) that continued to be produced into the early Ptolemaic period. Likely date 525BC to 450 or 400BC. Daressy, G. 1901. Rapport sur des fouilles \u00e0 Sa el-Hagar, Annales du Service des Antiquit\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c9gypte 2, 230-239. Dentzer, J-M. 1982.
