The group shows Isis offering her breast to her son, Harpocrates, who seems uninterested. Isis wears her usual knotted costume, which has been unbuttoned to expose the breast. Her long, corkscrew locks fall on to her shoulders. Harpocrates has a full head of hair and is wrapped in a cloak. A hole bored into the upper part of Isis' head is perhaps for a separately made crown, now missing. The fabric is a micaceous orange-brown Nile silt. There are minute traces of a white coating on the front. The back is unworked.

This group follows a series of similar compositions popular during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Bibliography: R.P. Hinks, 'Isis suckling Horus', 'British Museum Quarterly' 12 (1937-8), 74-5, pl.
