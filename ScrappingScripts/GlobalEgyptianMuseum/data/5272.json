{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "6609", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "EXTENDED MASK", "Material": "PLASTER", "Technique": "STUCCO", "Width": "29 cm", "Name": "Male head piece from a coffin", "Description": "The mask shows the head, upper body and hands of the deceased who is stretched out on a bier of which the head end is also visible. It was placed over the mummy to make the body seem lifelike. The liveliness of the masks was often enhanced by fitting the eyes with inlays. The face and hair have been shaped according to contemporary Roman taste. The only Egyptian element is the decoration. This type of object not only has aesthetic merit, but also eloquently attests to the continuation of ancient Egyptian burial rites and customs."}
