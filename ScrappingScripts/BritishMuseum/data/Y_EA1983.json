{"artifact_name": "stela(?)", "Object Type": ["stela (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA1983"], "Description": [" One half of a limestone stela (the other half is EA 1988), with incised Coptic texts on both sides. One side (here called A) bears the upper eight lines of a long text (EA 1988 bears the following ten lines). The other side (here called B) bears a shorter text of two lines. The two texts are evidently of a different date; one is upside down in relation to the other. One of the narrow sides bears remains of decorative reliefwork, which shows that the slab was extracted from a larger architectural element. If either inscription (side A or B) is viewed the right way up, the narrow decorated side is to its right.
