This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Naukratis Painter\u2019s Group. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it was found that the fabric originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286). It must also be pointed out that despite Jones' identification of the sherd as being in the Chalice Style, the sherd firmly belongs within the earlier Grand Style.
