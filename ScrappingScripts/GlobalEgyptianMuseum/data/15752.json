{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62268", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "DISH", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FAYENCE", "Diameter": "9.0 cm", "Name": "Blue Faience Bowl", "Description": "The polished blue faience bowl was typically used as a votive object in temples and shrines and was included in funerary equipment. Similar bowls were clearly associated with the goddess Hathor as part of her role as a deity of the necropolis. She was called the \"Mistress of turquoise,\" \"Mistress of lapis lazuli,\" and \"Mistress of the malachite land.\" The majority of these bowls, when discovered, were empty. However, a few were found containing milk, which implies that the bowls were used for offerings to the goddesses Hathor, Isis, or Nut in their roles as nourishing and protective deities."}
