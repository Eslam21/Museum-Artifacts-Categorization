{"artifact_name": "model; naos", "Object Type": [" model ", " naos "], "Museum number": ["EA36871"], "Description": [" Limestone model of a naos shrine. Much of the surface is now worn, but the outline of relief figures and details are still visible. Along the top edge of the naos shrine is a cornice detail, with small traces of an off-white coloured layer of paint or plaster. On the obverse, the upper relief scene shows the head and upper body of a figure carved in sunken relief, many of their features now worn. They are framed by a thin set of columns on either side. The lower scene shows another figure in the centre, possibly wearing a crown and their body cloaked. The corners of the naos are shaped into thick columns. On both sides of the naos are matching relief scenes of a hawk figure on the top, and below a jackal-headed figure wearing a short kilt and holding a sceptre, both facing towards the front of the shrine. The left side is considerably better preserved than the right side. On the reverse is a sunken scene of a doorway, topped with two birds and a winged sun-disc. The edges of the naos are particularly chipped and worn.
