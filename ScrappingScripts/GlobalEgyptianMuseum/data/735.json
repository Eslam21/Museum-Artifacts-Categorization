The owner of this funerary monument, who was of Syro-Palestinian origin, is shown adoring on the right, while king Tuthmosis III (1490-1436 BC) is seated on a throne. Between the two figures can be seen a table of offerings and a small stand supporting a jug. This latter perhaps provides a link with the job of Ramessesemperre, that of 'royal cup-bearer of the lord of the two lands'."}
