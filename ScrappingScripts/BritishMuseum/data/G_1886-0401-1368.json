Top face has been stamped or pressed onto a one-piece mould, then given a matt red slip. Stamped impression of a bull\u2019s head (boukranion) within a circle, surrounded by pointed-oval leaves or buds alternating with studs, all in relief. The back is roughly rounded. Brown Nile silt with red core typical of the Western Nile Delta. Frequent fine gold and silver mica <0.2mm, frequent off white (limestone) <2mm inclusions as well as fine organic vesicles, clay pellets (dung?) and very fine quartz. Traces of plaster adhere around the outside and bottom of the stopper, where it would have been attached to the amphora neck. Bottom was chipped, presumably when removed from amphora.

This seems to be an earlier Ptolemaic form, with a boukranion. The boukranion was a popular devise on Knidian amphora handles of the 2nd century BC (Omar & Thomas 2011). The red slip may be significant as plaster wine stoppers were painted red in Ptolemaic and Roman periods (Thomas 2011). Petrie\u2019s identification as a bread or cake-stamp is unlikely considering the presence of plaster and the form (Petrie et al. 1886: pl. xxix; Walters 1903: E 160). A good parallel from Thebes is dated 2nd to 1st century BC (Bailey 2008: no.3315), see also mould BM GR 1886,0401.1369 also from Naukratis for making such impressions BM (Bailey 2008: no.3308).
