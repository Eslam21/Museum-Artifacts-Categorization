{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA48982"], "Description": [" Brass lamp in the form of a standing female panther, with a long, octagonal-sectioned nozzle extending from the chest, terminating in an angular tip with a circular wick-hole. The animal is harnessed and wears a collar with circular pendants. The collar forms the rim of the filling-hole, and is stepped and hinged for a lid, which was formed by the panther's head, now lost. The straps of the harness and the collar are decorated with lozenges and transverse grooves. Suspension-loops (one lost) emerge from the harness on each side of the body; a third suspension-loop may have been placed on the back of the animal, just above the tail, where a cut down patch occurs. A large rectangular repair patch is let into the underside of the body, between the teats. Hinged lid missing. Surface colouration: patchy brown, dark and light green.
