{"artifact_name": "knob", "Object Type": ["knob"], "Museum number": ["EA85653"], "Description": [" Knob-shaped object made of fine brown Nile clay. The base is round and very flat, it was pressed onto a flat surface to form it. The upper side shows a central area that is raised with concave sides running upwards from the base and forms a cylindrical part with a shallow indentation in the middle to attach another object. The depth of this indentation is 0.9 cm, it has a diameter of 1.4 cm and the wall around it is 0.5 cm wide with an outer diameter of 2.2-2.3 cm for the central raised part.
