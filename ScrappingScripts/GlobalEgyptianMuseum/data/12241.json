{"Present location": "ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM [06/002] AMSTERDAM", "Inventory number": "APM 1387", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP II/AMENOPHIS II/AAKHEPERURE (not after); TUTHMOSIS III/MENKHEPERRE (not before)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "QUARTZITE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "27.5 cm", "Width": "18.5 cm", "Depth": "19 cm", "Name": "Head of a king's statue", "Description": "The fragment represents the right part of a head originally part of a larger statue. The head is that of a king with the nemes-head cloth hanging over the shoulders. The workmanship on the head is excellent: the eyes, nose and mouth are very finely carved. Between the neck and the ceremonial beard the stone has been left in its place.A discussion of this fragment is not possible without mentioning the missing part of the head, which has been found in 1968 in the Amun-temple at Karnak. In 1973, Ms Biri Fay discovered that the Amsterdam and Karnak fragments fitted together.Since neither one of the fragments bears any inscription, the attribution of the head to Thutmosis III or Amenhotep II is uncertain. A certain resemblance to heads of Amenhotep II cannot be denied, especially the view in profile and the rather broad nose. The treatment of the eyes and mouth though is different and resembles a head of Thutmoses III."}
