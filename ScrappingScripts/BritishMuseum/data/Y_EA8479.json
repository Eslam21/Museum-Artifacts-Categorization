{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8479"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Neskashuty: there are four sections of unequal size on this round-topped stela. At the top is a winged disk with two uraei under a curved sky. There follows a line of text naming Ra-Horakhty and Atum. In the third register the deceased stands on the right with arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a pottery vessel. Behind the altar stand Osiris, Isis whose wings enclose an 'wedjat'-eye, a standing serpent, Nephthys, and the four sons of Horus on a lotus-blossom. The final section contains three lines of text with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Atum on behalf of Neskashuty, son of \u1e32\u02bf\u1e25\u0292 and Mwt\u1ec9. The stela has suffered much loss to the surface especially the left lower corner. There is a blue border around three sides of the stela and the general background is white. The registers are divided by multi-coloured borders of blue, red, green, and pink-orange rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in light green. The sky is blue. The disk is red with pink-orange upper wings with blue dots and upper edge and blue lower wings edged in red. The uraei are pink with blue heads and dots and a white and red crown respectively. The hieroglyphs between the uraei are black while those on each side are blue, red, and green. The line of text in the second section is black. The human figure is red with a blue wig, green collar, and white and green garment. The altar is blue with a red vessel which has a blue top. Osiris has a light green body, face and sceptre, red hands, orange collar, and white crown with blue feathers. Isis has a green body and face, red dress and blue wig and head-dress. Her upper wings are light green with a patch of pink-orange dotted in blue, while her lower wings are blue edged in red. The 'wedjat'-eye is blue with a black pupil and red band between eye and eyebrow above a green basket. The serpent is blue with red feet and crown. Nephthys has a green body, red dress and streamers, blue wig, and green and red head-dress. The four sons of Horus have green bodies, pink-orange collars, and blue wigs. The first two have red faces, the third green and the fourth white with apparently black features. The lotus has green leaves with a blue and red blossom edged in white. The lines of text here and in the final section are black between blue lines. The text on the back is black. The back and sides of the stela are plastered white.
