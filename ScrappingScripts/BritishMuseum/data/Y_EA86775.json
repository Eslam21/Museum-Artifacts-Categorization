{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86775"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows not recognisable impressions, in the break the impression of a turned cord with a width of approximately 0.1 cm, but the object had not been cleaned before conservation which makes it hard to estimate the width of the cord. The front side is convex and is covered in finger impressions. It shows a part of a seal impression of an oval scarab-like seal showing a circumferential line and the lower end of a cartouche with a seated mAa.t with a sun disc, behind her a wAs-sceptre?
