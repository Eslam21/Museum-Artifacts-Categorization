The verso, on which the orientation of the text is inverted, consists of a single column of thirty one lines on the right hand side of the sheet in three sections. The columns on both sides get wider towards the bottom of the sheet. The papyrus was well-made and is in fairly good condition, although a few small fragments are missing on the right hand side in the middle along a crack in the papyrus and at the top of the sheet. Published: E. Peet, Great Tomb Robberies (1930), translation and commentary: pp. 169-75, pls. 36-7, but also referenced: p. 3, 7, 29, 69 n. 25, 128-9, 164 n. 56; K. Kitchen, \u2018Ramesside Inscriptions\u2019 Vol 6, p. 828. To be republished by CJ Eyre and M Collier (agreed 2006) Thieves of portable chests are also dealt with in the dockets on the verso of P. Abbott (EA 10221) and P. Mayer A in Liverpool (Peet 1930, 128-9). The inscription dates the trial to year 2 of the whm mswt period during the later part of the reign of Ramses XI. The handwriting is noted by Peet (1930, 169) to be very similar to that of Papyrus Mayer A and EA 10052, but differences prevent ascribing it to the same author. Most full-size accounts papyri measure 40 to 42 cm in height, but EA 10403 is unusually large at 45 cm.The crack in the middle of the papyrus and the associated missing fragments could be, but are not necessarily, due to folding in ancient times.
