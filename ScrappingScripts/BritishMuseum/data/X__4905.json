", " There are similar pieces to this head fragment in the British Museum of a standing Kore (GR1860,0404.57 from Kamiros), a seated Kore and another fragment (GR 1886,0401.1400 and GR1886,0401.1398 also Naukratis) or as an alabastron (GR1861, 0425.34 from Kamiros), all in similar micaceous orange fabric and all dated to the late 6th century BC (Higgins 1954, no.61). There is a close parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC-400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2114). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9). Probably from South Ionia, Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). A parallel from Erythrae, Turkey, dated between c. 540BC to c. 520BC (Bayburtluo\u011flu 1977, 80-1, pls. 9, 11 and 16, nos. 17, 19 and 27).
