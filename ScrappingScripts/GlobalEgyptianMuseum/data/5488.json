{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "75", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "51.8 cm", "Width": "33.5 cm", "Depth": "30.5 cm", "Name": "Scribal statue of Hen-Ka", "Description": "Uninscribed statue, acquired together with a sitting figure of Hen-Ka (\u00c3\u201eOS 74) in 1873. According to the records, both come from a tomb \"in the ruins of ancient Memphis\". There are other indications that the Vienna statue once also belonged to Hen-Ka. There are close stylistic parallels with another scribal statue of Hen-Ka in Berlin, which has similar facial features - strikingly wide ears, large eyes - and particularly the very rare posture, which is very similar to the Vienna piece. Some chisel marks which have not been smoothed can still be seen. The lack of any inscription also indicates that the statue arrived at the tomb in an unfinished state."}
