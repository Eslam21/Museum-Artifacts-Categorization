Lady Thuya was buried along with her husband in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes. The tomb was found nearly intact and displays the funerary furniture of high courtiers. The mummy of Lady Thuya, placed in three anthropoid coffins, one inside the other, has a beautiful gilded and inlaid cartonnage mask. This mask, which was supposed to preserve the features of Thuya, aimed to help the soul recognize its wrapped corpse to facilitate resurrection. Linen gauze covered the mask, which depicted the fine looking, distinguished and smiling face of Lady Thuya. The eyebrows, eyes and eyelids, as well as the broad collar, are all inlaid with stones and colored glass."}
