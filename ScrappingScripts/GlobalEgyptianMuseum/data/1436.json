{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8215", "Dating": "COPTIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FRIEZE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HIGH RELIEF; HEWN", "Height": "23 cm", "Depth": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Birds drinking", "Description": "The theme of birds drinking from a source of living water is widespread in Christian art. This fragment of a frieze shows in the middle a vessel from which two plants protrude, which then spill out in spirals towards the outside. In the hollow of each leaf perches a bird; that on the right is only half-visible, while that on the left appears more fully. Their heads are crowned by a crest, and their greedy beaks seek out the refreshing water."}
