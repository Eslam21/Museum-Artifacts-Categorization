{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 85802", "Dating": "21ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "TANIS", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "GOLD; LAPIS LAZULI", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Name": "Heart Amulet with a Chain", "Description": "The heart symbolized the conscience, which guided human beings to do good or evil. According to ancient Egyptian beliefs, it was the heart of the deceased that would be weighed on the scale in the court of justice of Osiris, in the afterlife, to find out whether its owner was guilty or innocent. Some spells from the Book of the Dead dealt with the heart, which is asked by the deceased not to oppose him at the judgment in the court of Osiris, or not to be driven away from him in the netherworld. In other spells, the deceased receives his heart again and wishes that it would stay with him and not be stolen or crushed. This is a heart amulet of lapis lazuli, made to be hung from a golden chain. It should have hung from the neck of the owner's mummy. The heart amulet (or a scarab) should be placed within the chest of the mummy as a substitute for the real heart. Then, the deceased would regain his vitality, have control over his organs, move, and live again."}
