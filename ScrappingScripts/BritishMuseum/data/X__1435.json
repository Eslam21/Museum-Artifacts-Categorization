The body is nude, except for an abbreviated garment with short sleeves, fastened at the chest and drawn up high at the rear, leaving the lower body uncovered. The detail of his face is lost and has been crudely carved with a flat instrument. He wears a cone shaped hat. Plastic oil-lamp made in three-piece plaster mould. Dark grey-brown Nile silt (over-fired) with abundant mica and white inclusions. Eroded.
