{"artifact_name": "necklace", "Object Type": ["necklace"], "Museum number": ["1917,0601.2709"], "Description": [" Bead ornament with pendant discs: the beads are threaded on modern brass wire. The two principal types of bead are small orange-red hardstones described by Marshall as garnet, but looking more like cornelian, and spacer beads formed of a short spiral of fine gold wire. In addition, there are two small, blue-green faience beads and seven dark blue beads, probably of glass. Hanging from the string of beads are twenty-nine gold-and-pearl pendants. These consist of a pearl capped with gold at each end and a wire loop from which hangs a small gold disc with a cut-out (making a crescent shape) occupied by another small pearl on a wire. The disc element of one pendant is lost, and next to this defective pendant are two additional ornaments, an oval dark green glass bead and a small faience, uraeus pendant. The twisted gold wire which attaches the uraeus to the necklace looks modern. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Roman Imperial"], "Production date": ["1stC-3rdC"], "Materials": [" garnet (?)

In the absence of any history, there must be some doubt about the overall integrity of the piece, though its appearance is akin to the hair ornament worn by the subjects of some Neronian portraits.
