{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "16029", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "EL-GABALIN/GEBELEIN", "Category": "BOAT (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "INCISED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "13.5 cm", "Width": "8.5 cm", "Name": "Model of a funerary boat", "Description": "Funerary boat, of low keel and not too high ends. Six persons are standing in line on its deck, holding a lamb to be sacrificed. On one end of the boat there is a squatting man, who would be in charge of the rudder, and next to him another man standing up, completing the crew. This piece is not of high artistic merit; it is the product of a workshop for middle class customers who were improving their lifestyle in this period. It is not a boat for going on pilgrimage to Abydos, but a model of offering bearers that were placed inside the tombs."}
