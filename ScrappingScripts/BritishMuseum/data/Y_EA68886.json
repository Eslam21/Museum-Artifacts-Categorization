From Shurafa: at the edge of the cultivation on the east bank of the Nile, about four miles from Mazghuneh, on the river, and about eight miles south of Helwan. The site may be the ancient Scenas Mandras (see R. Engelbach\u2019s discussion in Petrie et al. 1915: 40\u2013 2: the Roman fort and town seem to have been founded shortly before the third century AD and may have lasted until the twelfth century). This terracotta figure probably comes from a grave, and probably from the south cemetery (ibid.,: 44, described with fig. 26, where several examples of the type are mentioned, and are thought to be local products). Late Roman, fourth to fifth century AD? Comparanda: See a good quality plaster version in bust form from the same site: Petrie et al. 1915: pl. xxxix:26. Close: Bayer-Niemeier 1988: no. 259, also with scalloped wreath, dated to the second half of the fourth century AD.
