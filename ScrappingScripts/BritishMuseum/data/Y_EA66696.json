{"artifact_name": "sealing", "Object Type": ["sealing"], "Museum number": ["EA66696"], "Description": [" A sealing for an unknown object which included a palm-fibre cord, now gone: oval impression from an intaglio gem with a helmeted head, perhaps Ares or Athene, to right and a spear in front; the rest of the device is obscure, but may include two men in combat: the whole may be a combination of images to produce a single object (a gryllus). Adjacent is part of an impression from the same gem, showing the spear more clearly, and the edge of another seal. Unfired yellow-brown mud.
