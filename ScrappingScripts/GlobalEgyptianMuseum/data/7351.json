It possibly presents the name of Senwosret III. There remains but a fragment of the main print, put together in a fashion similar to that of R 23 (a). Here, it can once again be observed that the closing of the doors of the granary was controlled by a suboridnate civil servant. His personal seal, in scaraboid shape, bears neither his name nor his title, but is engraved with hieroglyphic signs grouped together in a decorative motif. "}
