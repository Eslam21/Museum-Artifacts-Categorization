It is particularly distinguished by a strange facial appearance: the eyes, the ears, the nose and the mouth are marked in an unrefined  way. The \"nemes\" head-dress, surmounted by a single uraeus, also has a special form. The shabti is holding a pair of hoes in the hands. The left shoudler supports an oblong sack.
