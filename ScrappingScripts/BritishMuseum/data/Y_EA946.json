{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA946"], "Description": [" Fragmentary black stone figure of a king, only the right side arm and torso remaining. The royal figure is depicted wearing a kilt which is belted at the waist, with a portion of a knot of material displayed across the lower torso. The central edge of the kilt appears to have a decorative sash across the clothing, though much of this is now lost. The portion of the torso and the right arm appear to be bare. Much of the statue is now lost, with considerable damage to the top and front of the stone. The figure has been attached to a modern support that obscures the left side and reverse of the figure. The object has been attached to a modern rectangular base.
