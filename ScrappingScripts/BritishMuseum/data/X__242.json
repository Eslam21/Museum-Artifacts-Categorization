", " Simple naked female plaque figures are common in Egypt during the Late Period and in the Levant at contemporary Phoenician sites. Parallels are generally dated to the Late Period and early Ptolemaic periods in Egypt. Thought to be fertility figures or ex-voto in honour of, but not representing, Hathor (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.109, nos 203-9, particularly no.208; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148, no.263-7, for wig, see no. 265; Weber 1914, no.199; Petrie 1909, pl.35.7 and 11 from Memphis; Kaufmann 1913, fig. 69:3). Tambourine players with Egyptian wigs are common figurine forms from Cyprus and Samos in the 6th century BC (Karageorghis 1999, pl.51.5-6 #VI(ii)10-11). Bayer-Niemeier identifies a clear \u2018Pharaonic tradition\u2019 clear with New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period parallels from Medinet Habu (Teeter 2010, nos 1 to 9 and 24 to 26) and the Temple of Mut in Luxor (Waraksa 2009, no. 3) and similar examples of this Pharaonic tradition come from New Kingdom domestic religion parallels from Deir el-Medina, Saw\u00e2ma and Amarna (ibid.). Similar figure plaques found at Naukratis in the British Museum (Bailey 2008, nos 3108 to 3110; Higgins 1954, 404; GR 1888,0601.113, GR1886,0401.1543, GR 1886,0401.1458), Cambridge (NA576, NA577, NA578, NA579, NA581, NA582, NA583, NA584, especially NA589), and by recent excavations at Naukratis by the Supreme Council of Archaeology, (SCA), (unpublished).
