{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 29168", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "SISTRUM", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "FAYENCE", "Height": "14.5 cm", "Width": "3.5 cm", "Name": "Double-Headed Hathor Sistrum", "Description": "The sistrum was one of the important instruments and amulets that accompanied the deceased in the hereafter. It was a symbol of the goddess Hathor, and was carried and shaken by her priestesses and priests in ceremonies, to appease the goddess. This sistrum amulet, in the shape of a miniature column, is one of the finest examples made of faience so far found in Egypt. The handle is surmounted by double heads of the goddess Hathor who has an almost human face, but cow's ears. Hathor wears a wig with long lappets that is incised with vertical and horizontal lines simulating strings to hold it in place. She is wearing a beaded collar. Cobras adorn the right and left sides of the head. The upper shrine still retains the two metal bars, on which the metal disks or loose rods for creating the rhythmic sound were hung. The cobra figure is shown as if emerging from the shrine to protect the cow's head and the user as well."}
