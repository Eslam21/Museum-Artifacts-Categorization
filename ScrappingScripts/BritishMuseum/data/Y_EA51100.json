{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA51100"], "Description": [" Limestone seated figure of Horus wearing Roman military costume; traces of paint; arms lost. The figure originally wore a crown, probably of another material, inserted into the top of the head. The falcon head is rendered with careful attention to the feathering around the face; the eyes are human and the pupils are incised. The feathers of the falcon god double as the scales of a mail shirt (described by the modern term lorica plumata), the sleeves of which end below the shoulders. A knotted cingulum encircles the waist, dropping to the hips in contrast to the more typically depicted position at a soldier's natural waist. A cloak fastened at the right shoulder by a round plate fibula is pushed back over the shoulders. A separate garment covers the legs. The attitude is one of casual repose, common to images of senior Graeco-Roman deities.
