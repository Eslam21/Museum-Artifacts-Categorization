It shows a goddess (Isis or Nephthys) raising her arms in a gesture of protection, wearing a black tripartite wig, and clothed in a simple sheath dress with white straps leaving the breasts exposed and a black wesekh collar. This simplicity of dress, inspired by older times, is one of the characteristics of the representation of divinities. The texts name the goddesses Selket and Neith and entrust the lady of the house Ibet to their protection."}
