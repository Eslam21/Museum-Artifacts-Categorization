{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.51"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Seilenos with a panther. Seilenos standing on a ground-line above a low plinth, naked and with his legs apart. He is bearded and balding, wearing a tightly woven wreath crossed by a horizontal fillet. He has anklets or possibly boots. A hole for the insertion of a separately made large phallus remains at the appropriate place. He holds a kantharos in his lowered left hand, and supports a panther with his right hand as it reaches across him to drink from the cup. At his left side a vine with a bunch of grapes grows up. The back is plain, with a suspension-lug placed behind the satyr\u2019s neck. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with the remains of a white dressing, mainly on the front. Traces of pink paint remain on the flesh of Seilenos.
