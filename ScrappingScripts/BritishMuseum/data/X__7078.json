", " Label reads 'Naukratis', though the type and date seems unusual for a Nile Delta site, as these have better Fayum parallels. Roman parallels from the Fayum have been interpreted as priestess' (Dunand 1979, 85-6; Dunand 1990, no. 322-4, particularly 323). Other parallels have been dated more specifically to the late 1st century AD (Bayer Niemeier 1988, no.292), or the late 1st to 2nd century AD (Fjeldhagen 1995, no. 105). A dubious 2nd to 1st century BC date was ascribed to an example thought to have come from the Roman site of Antinoe(?) (Besques 1992, D/E 4516) and a British Museum parallel has been dated Ptolemaic (Bailey 2008, no. 3202).
