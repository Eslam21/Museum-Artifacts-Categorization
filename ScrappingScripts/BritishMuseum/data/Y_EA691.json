{"artifact_name": "relief", "Object Type": ["relief"], "Museum number": ["EA691"], "Description": [" Pink sandstone stela of Zanakht: King Zanakht is smiting a foreigner (no longer visible) who personified the tribes of the Eastern Desert. The sovereign, whose name is inscribed in a 'serekh' surmounted by the falcon god Horus, is wearing the red crown, symbol of his power over Lower Egypt. In front of him on a pole was the emblem of the god Wepwawet, now lost. The few hieroglyphs surviving in the right corner of the fragment signify \"turquoise,\" a highly prized stone, which the Egyptians went to the mountains of the Sinai peninsula to extract.

It does not display the same sculptural qualities as reliefs almost as old from Saqqara or Heliopolis. It belongs to a series of inscriptions with the names of kings Djoser, Sekhemkhet, and Sanakht that commemorate the first expeditions launched by the pharaohs to the so-called turquoise terraces. Distinguished from nonroyal inscriptions by their bellicose iconography, they magically mark the limits of the pharaoh's domain and immortalise his appropriation of the world. A text from the time of Djedkare-Isesi, a Fifth Dynasty pharaoh, reveals that royal troops also came to Wadi Maghara to seek another very precious resource, copper. Bibliography: A. H. Gardiner, E.
