Brown Egyptological Studies 1. ", " This papyrus from the late Nineteenth Dynasty (around 1225 BC) is one of the most extensive calendar of lucky and unlucky days that survived from ancient Egypt. It yields entries for days during eight months. The entry for each day is prefaced by three hieroglyphs that indicate 'good' or 'bad'. The 'bad' hieroglyphs are written in red. If a day is partly good and partly bad, the relevant hieroglyphs can be mixed to represent the assessment of the day. The character of a day often derives from events told in mythological history. For some days the text is quite obscure, and others may not appear to the modern reader as good or bad as they did to the Egyptians. An example of a bad day: 'Do not go out on this day. Do not turn your back to do any work at sunset. Whoever is born on this day will die through a serpent'. An example of a good day: 'This is the day on which the gods received their hearts. The world keeps the festival'. Published: Leitz, Ch. 1994.
