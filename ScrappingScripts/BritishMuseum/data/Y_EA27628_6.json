Petrie noted that \u2018many thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u2019 as well as unfinished vessels in alabaster were found in the temenos of Apollo, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). The bulk of calcite vessels discovered in Naukratis are alabastra, but other shapes are present such as bowl, jug and lekythos. The drilling was performed by using a tube in copper alloy with abrasive, usually dry sand. On Egyptian stone vessels and their production: Nicholson, P.
