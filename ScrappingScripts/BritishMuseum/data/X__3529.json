A bowl from Naukratis, Boston 88.1033 (Fairbanks pl.33, 315; Samos 6.1, pl.125 no.1018), also has a band of checkers on the exterior and Cook cites as \"an abnormal [Clazomenian] oinochoe\" a vessel with a band of \"five chequers...around the top of its belly\" (\"List of Clazomenian Pottery\", p.144).
