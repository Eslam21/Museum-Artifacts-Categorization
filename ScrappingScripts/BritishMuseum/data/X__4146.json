", " Amulets representing a hieracocephal male figure can refer to various Egyptian deities (when double-crowned particularly various forms of Horus: Andrews 1994, 27-28). For another amulet from Naukratis representing a hieracocephal deity, but wearing a sun-disc with uraeus: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H1030. On amulets of falcon-headed deities see: Andrews 1994, 27-30; Herrmann et al. 2010, 61-63 (type 26). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
