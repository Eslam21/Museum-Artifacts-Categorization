The tablet has been carefully smoothed on all sides and the corners are rounded off. One face has six incised horizontal dividing lines, accurately spaced with care. At the top a small hole has been drilled, almost exactly in the centre, 7 cm from the left edge. It appears that the slab was never actually used."}
