", " Part of the Egyptian \u2018frog lamp\u2019 group with moulded decoration of a frog that has the lamp nozzle in place of its head all in a buff clay, frequently dated to the 3rd or 4th centuries AD (Bailey 1988, Q2178 to Q2181). Bailey warns that late 2nd or early 3rd century AD \u2018frog lamps\u2019 from Myos Hormos (Whitcomb & Johnson 1982, pl.60dd) and from el-Ashmunein (Bailey 1998, pl.87 X13), suggest these have also been made before the 3rd century AD. Recent excavations have allowed for the chronology to be refined and reviewed for this form, that is now known to date back to at least the early or mid 2nd century AD (and possibly the end of the 1st century AD). This example is similar to a late Augustan example of an early Frog lamp found at Quseir al-Qadim (Peacock 2011, no. 6, pp) dated to the end of the 1st century BC to early 1st century AD, however it is closest to later variants found in mid 2nd to early 3rd century AD layers (Peacock 2011, nos. 27, 28, pp; Van Rengen & Thomas 2006, 149). Parallels from Mons Claudianus were found in Trajanic, Hadrianic and Severan contexts (Knowles 2006, Types 6-9 have closest form, Types 21-23 have the same fabric and decoration). Clay similar to lamp in Bolton Museum (1886.31.10). Parallel from Schedia (Abd El-Fattah 1998, 51-2, fig. 24). Abd El-Fattah, A. 1998.
