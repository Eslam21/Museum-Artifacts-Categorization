{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "6220", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "20.9 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a servant", "Description": "The statuette represents a striding, slightly bent man with his left foot advanced. He wears a short garment and a wig covering his ears. The body is painted red, the whites and the garment are white, the wig and eyelids are black. Since the arms that were originally pegged are lost, the attribution of the statuette is questionable. It might be an image of a servant either empting a basket of corn or pouring water or beer into a large vessel."}
