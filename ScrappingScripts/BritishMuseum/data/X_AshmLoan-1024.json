", " Lemos places this sherd in Stage 2 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless. The vases in Stage 2 have even more basic rosettes than the vases from Stage 1. Furthermore, the deterioration of the Sphinx and Lion Style appears quite clearly in the execution of the face of the different figures. Lemos identifies the sherd as coming from a lekane with offset rim, however, if this were the case, the frieze of lions is upside down. Beazley suggests that the sherd may come from the rim of a dinos, but the interior of Chian dinoi is typically undecorated and unslipped. The fabric of the sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it was found that the fabric originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286). It must also be pointed out that despite Jones' identification of the sherd as being in the Chalice Style, the sherd firmly belongs within the earlier Sphinx and Lion Style.
