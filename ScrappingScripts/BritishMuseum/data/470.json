suckling Harpocrates.<br/><br/>Relief representations of the gods feature across the front of the obelisk shape – on the left, Isis is shown seated with the god Harpocrates (Horus-the-Child) seated in her lap. She cradles his head with her left hand while she offers him her breast with her right. The bodies and faces of both Isis and Harpocrates are only minimally outlined, with little detail of hair, clothing, or other adornments. Isis in particular does not appear to wear any vulture cap or headdress. Osiris is depicted in mummified form on the right, wearing the feathered atef-crown and with his entire body enveloped in material.

of a male figure, the body and base now missing.   The figure is depicted with a shaven head, with emphasised modelling of the skull around the back of the head. The figure has rounded cheeks with the fleshy appearance of the skin particularly prominent at either side of the nose and at the chin. The eyes are rounded and wide, with an incised rim along the upper eyelid and raised ridges above indicating the arched eyebrows. The sunken skin underneath the eyes creates the suggestion of the eyes bulging out from the sockets, and though damaged the nose also appears broad in size.

rectangular base.<br/><br/>The god wears the feathered atef-crown with a uraeus cobra at his forehead, and a divine false beard. His eyes are lopsided and uneven in size, with the left eye much lower than the right eye. The nose is broad and the lips are pursed together. The face is particularly fleshy around the jawline. There is little definition of the neck area, particularly at either side of the body. He is depicted in mummified form with the material open at the top as indicated by a stiff upper ridge at either shoulder, exposing part of the upper body.

His nose is damaged, and his mouth appears small in size with a fleshy and rounded appearance of the face at the cheeks and jawline. The outer corners of his mouth appear upturned to create a slight smile. He wears an ankle-length garment wrapped high on the waist, with a knot of material visible on the right side of the torso.

theophorous statue of a male official carrying the image of a lion-headed goddess.  The male figure wears a smooth shoulder-length ‘bag wig’, a simple headcloth style typical of the 26th Dynasty. His eyes are narrowed and almond shaped with elongated cosmetic lines at the edges. He has thin arched eyebrows, a slim nose  and a small mouth with visibly upturned corners that suggest a slight smile. His face is rounded and fleshy, particularly at the cheeks and around the jawline. He wears a knotted strap of clothing over the left shoulder and a further strip of material is visible on the right side of the statue’s torso. Though his arms are lost, he likely held a base or seat which the deity’s image was placed upon.

female suckling a child, shown seated on a high-backed chair.<br/><br/>The female wears a long wig detailed in black paint, with a broad floral band across the front and sides of the head delineated with thick lines of red-brown paint. On the top of her head appears to be a section of a headdress or possible crown, which is now damaged. Her facial features are crudely rendered, with narrow eyes, thin eyebrows and a long slim nose. Her mouth is wide and the lips are pursed together, with traces of a red-brown colour around the edges. There is little definition between her neck and upper body. Her arms are simplistically modelled, with the right arm held up to the chest and the left arm placed across the waist.

Above his forehead the headcloth is adorned with the coiled body and raised hood of the uraeus cobra, its head now lost. Both arms of the king are damaged from the elbow but were likely held flat against the sides of the body. The torso is bare, with subtle modelling of the musculature of the chest and narrowed waist. A semi-circular shape on the left side of the torso was likely a section of looped material from the kilt.

The inscriptions are incised on the right shoulder of the figure and on the stela. The stela comprises two registers. On the first, a cluster of flowers is placed before the ram of Amun, on whose head is a head-dress consisting of two plumes with sun's disc and uraeus. The scene is carved in sunk relief.

on a backless chair.<br/><br/>He wears a short striated wig with a centre parting which has been painted black, and red-brown paint has been applied to convey his skin. He has almond shaped eyes delineated with white paint and a thin outline of black paint around both eyelids. His eyebrows are thick and slightly arched, and also painted black. His nose is short and his mouth is wide with thick, pursed lips. He has rounded fleshy cheeks and a rounded chin. The head is slightly disproportionately sized and the neck is short and broad, while the slightly hunched upper back creates the suggestion that the figure is leaning slightly forward.

gneiss male figure, the rest of the statue now lost.<br/><br/>The figure wears a striated wig, with only the section across the top of the head still intact. The wig is set low on the forehead and tucked behind the right ear. His eyes are narrow with a thick upper eyelid and thick eyebrows modelled in raised relief. His nose is damaged but the outline appears broad at the nostrils, and there is a clear cupid’s bow above his upper lip. The mouth is fleshy with thick lips that are pursed together.

The tip of the nose is also lost.

male figure, the lower body and back-pillar now missing.<br/><br/>The figure wears a smooth shoulder-length wig with flared ends, and the hair is tucked behind slightly oversized ears. His eyes are large with a thick ridge across the upper eyelids and a faint thin line underneath the eyes. His nose is broad and there is no delineation of the nostrils, though there appears to be a faint line on either side of the nose. The mouth is small with faintly incised lips, and the face is rounded and fleshy at the jawline.

Two dedications to Ptah on behalf of the High Priest of Ptah, Hori, are lightly incised around the front of the naos. His name and titles appear again on the front base of the naos and on the top of the naos. On the right side of the naos is incised an invocation to Hathor on behalf of the High Priest of Ptah, Hori, son of the High Priest of Ptah, Khaemwaset, made by his son the pure-priest and lector-priest of Ptah, Wr-?rp-?mww or ?mww-wr-s?m.

He is shown kneeling and resting on his heels, and on his feet he wears sandals. His arms extend out in front of him to support a tall naos shrine with the image of the god Ptah. The god is identifiable via his mummified form, skullcap and the was sceptre he holds in both hands. The top, edges and front of the naos are inscribed with text that provides the name and titles of Hori and some of his family members.

roughed out in the form commonly used for many Old Kingdom sculptures of women. The subject is shown standing with her legs close together and her arms at her sides, with the hands open, the palms resting on the thighs. A line in black paint runs down the front of the body from between the clearly marked clavicles down through the navel (marked by a black spot), over the pubic area (sharply marked as a triangular feature), and between the legs, petering out at about the level of the knees. Although some parts of the figure have been worked almost to a finished state, much remained to be done to complete it. The head is particularly informative. The facial features are clearly established but by no means molded to acceptable forms. The eyebrows are strongly marked but need a fining down suitable for a female figure; the eyes are marked out as simple lentoid shapes; the nose is a triangular protuberance awaiting detail; the mouth is pronounced and unshaped. The wig is covered with small tool marks, little facets produced by a chisel, or, more probably, a small adze. The body of the figure, however, is in an almost finished state. The breasts are neatly modeled, the waist slender and set rather high, as is common in figures of the late Old Kingdom; the buttocks are well formed and somewhat prominent. The arms and legs, in contrast, are lacking in modeling, and the fingers and toes are simply marked out by grooves. No suggestion of dress is apparent in this carving.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9312","id":"x9312","uuid":"0824d86c-c883-3454-aefc-32d57c22401d"}},"value_combined":"_statuette|statuette","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"sculpture","summary_title_combined":"_sculpture|sculpture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x8949","checksum":4233206721,"id":"x8949","uuid":"5da4d4c3-ae96-3503-a873-24b20458514c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure","summary_title_combined":"_figure|figure","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","checksum":2122460216,"id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"statue","summary_title_combined":"_statue|statue","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9311","checksum":1129859422,"id":"x9311","uuid":"442682fc-81b9-3306-a127-3b48477d6d57"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"statuette","summary_title_combined":"_statuette|statuette","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9312","id":"x9312","uuid":"0824d86c-c883-3454-aefc-32d57c22401d"}}]],"sort":"statuette","type":"object
