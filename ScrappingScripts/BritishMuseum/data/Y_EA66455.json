Petrie illustrated a number of different versions, with the specific motif displayed on this scaraboid being found on several examples and notably in the Scarab Factory (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45, see especially 44 for this piece). This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A72a). It should correspond to Gorton A184, though this number is used for two different scaraboids, this one which is decorated with a seated lion and another one decorated with a seated winged griffin (BM 1886,0401.1698).
