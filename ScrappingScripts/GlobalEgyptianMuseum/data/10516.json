In the upper scene we see the state god Amun-Re standing in front of a naos containing the statues of the mummiform creator god of Memphis Ptah and of the king, deified in his image. The latter is identified as Ramesses II by his formal name and the additional name  \"Montu of the two lands\". Behind the king is a vertical column of six ears. Beneath this is the family of the dedicator, represented kneeling and with their arms raised in adoration. On the right, Sethi-er-neheh himself is represented first, followed by his wife, then another woman, and finally his son and daughter who are represented standing."}
