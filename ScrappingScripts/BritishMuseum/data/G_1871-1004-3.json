These usually support an image of the horned god (variously interpreted as Baal-Hammon, Zeus-Hammon or a Cypriot deity using the iconography of these foreign deities (Sophocleous 1985,.58-69; Buchholz 1991; Counts 2008; Kleibel 2007). Buchholz mistakenly attributed the item to the Lang collection, though it may well have originated there (perhaps as a gift to Cesnola from Lang) if the Dali provenance given by Myres (ABSA 41, 1940-45, 64) is correct, though this is uncertain.
