Some of the vases in this group have a unique rim pattern and have filling ornament; the birds featured on the cups are well proportioned and balanced. It must be noted that this sherd has no filling ornament. She also places the sherd in Stage 2 of that group, all made by the same artist; the composition is well-balanced and the images are precise; with a repeated pattern of incisions. Incision marks on this sherd are not the same as those on British Museum 1886,0401.1563, which Lemos also places in this group."], "Bibliographic references": [" Johnston 1978 / Pottery from Naukratis: An Exhibition on the Occasion of the 11th International Congress of Classical Archaeology (no. 87.)
