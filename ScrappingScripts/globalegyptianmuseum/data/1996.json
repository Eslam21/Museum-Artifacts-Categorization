{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1901:786", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "JEWELLERY", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Width": "3 cm", "Name": "Collar terminal in form of an open lotus flower", "Description": "Polychrome faience inlay or collar terminal in the form of an open lotus flower, with white background, lapis-blue for the three main petals, and smaller details in yellow and green. Late 18th Dynasty craftsmen made particular use of different colours in faience production. This piece was found at Deir el-Bahari, where numerous votive offerings had been made to the goddess Hathor. Those are often in blue, the colour of the heavens and of the life-giving Nile waters. Other finds at the site include tomb goods, and it is not certain whether this lotus is a votive gift to the goddess or a fragment of burial equipment from a local tomb."}
