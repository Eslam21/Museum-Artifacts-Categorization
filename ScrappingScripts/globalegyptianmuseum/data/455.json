It consists of a board and twelve pyramidal-shaped pieces, all made of unfired clay. The table and its four feet have been separately modelled, dried, and then assembled using fresh clay. The surface is divided into three rows of six squares, and the grid is indicated by means of small holes. The object is most probably a funerary model and not intended to be actually used by the living."}
