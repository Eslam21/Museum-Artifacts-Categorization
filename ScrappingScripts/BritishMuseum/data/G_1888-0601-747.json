Petrie listed a number of different amulet-moulds, including one used for Bes head (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 14), which could be this specimen. The negative mould was made by pressing a positive model into a ball of wet clay, with smooth band all round above the details of Bes head to aid extraction of the moulded object. An identical mould, BM 1920.0417.2, was likely made from the same matrix/positive model. The drawing in Petrie 1886 (pl. XXXVIII, no. 14) is a slightly simplified version, but must be of the same piece(s). However, he does not mention these Bes heads in either his letter to Mr. Poole of 28th February 1885 or his publication (Petrie1886, 37b). Gorton, A.
