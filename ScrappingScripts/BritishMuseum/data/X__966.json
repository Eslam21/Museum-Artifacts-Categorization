This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This type of inscription (especially \u2018praised by Khonsu\u2019 and \u2018praised by Amun\u2019) is very common on scarabs. In Naukratis itself: Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 112 (hieroglyphs arranged in a column). For other parallels, see: Petrie 1888, pl. VIII n\u00b064-65, 76; Newberry 1907, pl. X nos. 36609, 36623, 36626, 36879, 36900, 36914; Newberry 1908, 190, pl. XL, no. 10; Teeter 2003, 21, no. 1. Since the Museum register mentions that it was found in the Scarab Factory, a 26th Dynasty date could be a possibility. However, the Scarab Factory is a findspot that has been reported for scarabs and scaraboids of a secure earlier date. This scarab presents affinities with Gorton's type IX (Gorton 1996, 27-30, see particularly the example found in Ischia no. 21), mainly distributed in the Western part of the Mediterranean, especially in Carthage) and little attested in Greece. Type IX scarabs are documented from contexts dated between the mid-8th till the 6th century BC (Gorton 1996, 30). For a similar inscription arranged vertically, on a glazed composition scarab see BM 1886,0401.1611. Newberry, P.E. 1907, Scarab-schaped seals, CGC n\u00b036001-37521, London.
