In October of that year they visited the Castle of St Peter at Bodrum to assess, on behalf of the British Ambassador at Constantinople, Stratford Canning, whether it was possible to remove the slabs originally from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which had been incorporated into the wall of the castle. Unable to gain authorisation by the Turkish authorities to enter the castle, Dadd was only able to draw the four slabs visible from the outside. Phillips sent his report, which included the four drawings by Dadd, to Canning. The drawings, which are now lost, were passed on to Walter Devereux. In 1844 permission to enter the Castle was finally granted to Canning\u2019s Oriental Secretary, Charles Alison, together with Devereux. Devereux made sketches of seven slabs and had them lithographed together with Dadd\u2019s drawings, or rather his copies of Dadd\u2019s drawings, for his 1847 publication 'Views on the shores of the Mediterranean'.
