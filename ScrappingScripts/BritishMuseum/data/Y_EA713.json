According to Laurent Coulon (CNRS, Lyon), the item was reused in the doorstep of the gate of the chapel of Osiris Wennefer Nebjefau, built under the reign of Amasis, in the northern area of Karnak,where it has been discovered by Georges Legrain at the beginning of the year 1900 (cf. correspondence Legrain Maspero 12/2/1900). The statue was originally standing in an earlier chapel (XXVth dynasty) dedicated to Osiris Wennefer Pa-Hapy, possibly in the area. The so-called chapel of Osiris Neb-Neheh (Amasis / Psametik III), situated immediately to the south of the chapel of Osiris, might have replaced this earlier chapel and, in fact, mightalso have been dedicated to this Osiris Pa-Hapy."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["good"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Rev Chauncey Murch"], "Acquisition date": ["1906"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA713"], "Registration number": ["1906,0714.4"]}
