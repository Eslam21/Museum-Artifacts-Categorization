The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Most of Naukratis votive boxes displayed a figure of a reptile (lizard and snake) or an eel, such as this one. Reptiles are particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (for the snake relic-box: Weiss 2012, 276-278). Snake votive boxes pertain particularly to the types T 13 and T 14 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 725-731, Taf. 42c-e, 75a/g, 77l, Typ T 13 and T 14, esp. Nr. 741-743, 745-746, 750-754, 758-762, 764-767 from Naukratis). For this specimen, Weiss proposes the type T 14 (Weiss 2012, Nr. 766). Type T 14 usually represents a coiled snake, looped over itself to form a figure of eight (Taf. 42d-e), though in some instances, a short elongated snake is possible (Taf. 42f). Type T 13 represents a snake with head erect (raised cobra/uraeus). Since the head of the snake on this relic-box is damaged, it is uncertain to which type this votive box pertains. Petrie, W. M.
