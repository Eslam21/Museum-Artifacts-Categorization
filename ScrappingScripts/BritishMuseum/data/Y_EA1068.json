The outline of the legs is concealed by a long garment which is suspended from the neck by two braces, tied in a cartouche-shaped knot at the nape. The inscriptions, including the prenomen of Amenhotep III, are incised on the front of the right shoulder and down the centre of the dress, and are carved in low relief in the cartouche on the back. The head and much of the shoulders and left arm are missing, but the text, apart from slight mutilation of the cartouche on the back, is well preserved.
