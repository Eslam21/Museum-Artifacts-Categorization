The container takes the form of cartouche or royal name-ring, symbol of universal sovereignty in which the name of the king was written. A figure of a kneeling king is welded to it; he wears the close cap typical of 25th Dynasty Pharaohs, with the royal cobra or uraeus rising at the brow. Fully preserved examples show that the part where the incense was burned took the form of an outstretched human hand, and the handle was in the form of a falcon head."}
