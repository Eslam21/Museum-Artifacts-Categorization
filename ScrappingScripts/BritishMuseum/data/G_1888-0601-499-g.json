Although Lemos does not specifically classify this sherd in the Group of Late Wild Goat sherds from Rizari, she does include one of the joining sherds (1888,0601.460.c) in this group because of its milky white slip which is found on all examples from this group and because of the debased character of the patterns and filling ornament (Lemos 1991, 77). Williams notes that Chian Wild Goat Style dinoi sherds are often mistaken for oinochoai because of the lack of slip on the interior surface."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
