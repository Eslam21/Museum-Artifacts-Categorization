It is inscribed in Egyptian hieroglyphs on the right side of the base: 'Harpokrates grant ... to Us-ankh, son of Pethy' and on the other three sides in Phoenician: 'May Harpokrates give life to Amos, son of Esmunyaton, son of Azarmikk'. This is a votive object, offered to a deity with prayers for the god's favour or help. The Greeks created the name of Harpokrates from the Egyptian 'Har-pa-khered', literally 'Horus-the-child'. He acted as an amuletic force warding off dangerous creatures. In the Phoenician world he was a popular deity. The Phoenicians were closely connected to Egypt by both geography and trade, and adopted many Egyptian deities."], "Bibliographic references": [" British Museum Report of the Trustees 1966 / Report of the Trustees 1966 (p.38) ", " Barnett 1963a / A review of acquisitions 1955-62 of Western Asiatic Antiquities (I) (p.85, pl.41a) ", " Ferron J 1974a / La statuette d\u2019Harpocrate du British Museum ", " Vittmann G 2003a / \u00c4gypten und die Fremden im Ersten Vorchristlichen Jahrtausend (pl.7a) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 2009 1 May-20 Sep, Victoria, Royal BC Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures Exhibition: 'Phoenicians and the Mediterranean' / 'La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e des Ph\u00e9niciens de Tyr \u00e0 Carthage', L'Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris, 6th Oct 2007-20th Apr 2008. 2007 3 Feb-27 May, Taipei, National Palace Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2006 18 Mar-4 Jun, Beijing, Capital Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2005 27 Oct-2006 31 Jan, Haengso Museum, Keimyung University, Daegu, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2005 25 Jul-8 Oct, Busan Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2005 11 Apr-10 Jul, Seoul Arts Centre, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2004 26 Jun-29 Aug, Niigata Bandaijima Art Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2004 10 Apr-13 Jun, Fukuoka Art Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2004 17 Jan-28 Mar, Kobe City Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2003 18 Oct-14 Dec, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Treasures of the World's Cultures 2022-2023 13 Oct-19 Feb, London, BM, G30, Hieroglyphs: Unlocking Ancient Egypt "], "Subjects": [" ancient egyptian deity ", " serpent ", " symbol "], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Us-Ankh (dedicator of statue) ", " Named in inscription: Pethy (Father of Us-ankh) ", " Named in inscription: Amos (dedicator of statue) ", " Named in inscription: Esmanyaton (Father of Amos) ", " Named in inscription: Azarmikk (Grandfather of Amos) ", " Named in inscription: Harpocrates "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Spink & Son Ltd"], "Acquisition date": ["1960"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "BM/Big number": ["132908"], "Registration number": ["1960,1210.1"], "Conservation": [" Treatment: 13 Sep 2007 ", " Treatment: 16/02/1962 ", " Treatment: 11 Nov 2021 "]}
