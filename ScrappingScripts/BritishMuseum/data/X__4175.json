", " Several 'offering spoons', often referred to as cosmetic dishes or toilet spoons, were discovered in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). They are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. They occur for example at Bubastis, Tanis, Zagazig, Sais, Saqqara and Memphis (Wallert 1967, 53). As demonstrated by J. Bult\u00e9, the general theme displayed on offering spoons is often associated with the act of offering or with the offering itself (Bult\u00e9 2008). This specimen belongs to a very popular type, an open hand holding a mussel-shaped scoop. Most of the offering spoons from Naukratis pertain to that type and are made out of bone, such as this specimen (for the other specimens: Cairo, Egyptian Museum JE33549, BM 1888,0601.75, a possible unfinished one Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.113). Already common in the New Kingdom, the hand-shell type persisted in the Third Intermediate Period, with some differences in the material and innovations in the overall shape (Bult\u00e9 2008). During the Late Period very close archaizing copies of the New Kingdom are again produced. For example, two hand-shell spoons in bone were discovered in the Priests\u2019 Quarter in Karnak in a sealed context dated to the late 26th-early 27th dynasty (Masson 2007, pl. XXIX, 1-2). Considering the archaizing tendency of the 26th dynasty and this parallel, this piece should probably be dated to the Saite Period - early Persian Period at the latest.
