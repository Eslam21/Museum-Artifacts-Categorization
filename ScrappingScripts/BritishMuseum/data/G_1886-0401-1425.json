Part of a handle, probably of a wide-mouthed jug or, less likely, a wide-rimmed bowl or krater. Applied to the rim and to the curve of the handle below it is a dramatic mask, probably of an Old Man in the New Comedy. His hair rises over the forehead and is brushed back, the brow is creased and prominent, twisted above bulging eyes, the moustache is wide, extending to the beard, but most of the beard is lost below the mouth. The mask was pressed into a one-piece mould and applied to the handle. Traces of a white dressing survive on the face and beard, the flesh was painted pink. Traces of green paint on handle. Red-brown Nile silt with a red and brown core, common fine gold mica and sparse white inclusions.
