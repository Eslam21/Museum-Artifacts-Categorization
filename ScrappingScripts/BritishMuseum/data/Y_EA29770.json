The wings are examples of protective symbolism that, like the feather patterns on many anthropoid coffins of the Seventeenth and early Eighteenth Dynasties, evokes the guardianship of Isis and other deities. This woman's name, once written at the bottom of each column of hieroglyphs, has been lost. There are two columns of hieroglyphic text on the chest.

The striped wig, predominantly blue in colour, together with the white ground of the front and rear flaps associate the mask stylistically with the 'white'-type of anthropoid coffin which was in use at Thebes approximately from the reign of Tuthmosis I to that of Tuthmosis III.)"], "Production date": ["1500BC (circa)"], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Egypt, Probably from Thebes "], "Materials": [" linen ", " plaster ", " gold "], "Technique": [" painted ", " gilded "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 45.50 centimetres ", " Height: 61 centimetres ", " Width: 32.50 centimetres ", " Depth: 19 centimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["The frontal inscription may have given the name of the owner, but, if so, this is now lost. The mask was acquired together with several large pieces of fine linen inscribed in ink with the name Satdjehuty, who is described as 'one who is praised' by Queen Ahmose-Nefertary (wife of King Ahmose I). Samuel Birch, who inspected the items before purchase in 1880, suggested that the mask and the textiles had belonged to the same person (Minutes of the BM Trustees Standing Committee, 8 May 1880), which appears probable as the stylistic features of the mask are consistent with the date suggested by the linen-texts. The fine quality of the mask would also be appropriate to an individual who was in favour at the royal court. Bibliography: T. G. H. James & W. V.
