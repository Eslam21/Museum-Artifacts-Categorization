{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "39.4042A", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS OF HUMANS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "PAINTED; VARNISHED", "Width": "49.5 cm", "Depth": "27 cm", "Name": "Coffin", "Description": "The lid and box of this coffin are clearly not a set (for the base see number 39.4042Ab). The lid is mummiform, the headdress coloured blue, red and white and the beard is still in place. Under the pectoral is a figure of Nut with wings outstretched, to either side of her is a ram-headed figure wearing a double-plumed headdress and flanked by short vertical lines of inscription, the htp-dj-nsw formula. Further down is a horizontal band of decoration depicting the judgement of the deceased, Thoth leading him to a pair of scales, past 'the Devourer'. To the right is Osiris accompanied by an indistinct figure and beyond them a damaged winged figure and eight more bearded, standing figures, all human-headed (see Text Comment in Advanced Mode/Textual Data).Below this is a scene showing the body of the deceased lying on a bier, Anubis stands at it's foot and over the chest seems to be a Ba-bird partially erased. There are seven vertical columns of inscription, the last of which names the deceased as Pedneferhotep. His father's name has an uncertain reading, possibly Pedneb-amun, and the mother's name is Neswa. Over the feet is a large scarab beetle, on either side of which are representations of the god Anubis as a jackal couchant upon a shrine. On the footboard is a sun-disk."}
