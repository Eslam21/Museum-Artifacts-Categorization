The 'Actium' coin issues In the late 30s and early 20s BC Octavian issued a series of inventive coin-types. His bust is beautifully modelled and divinely anonymous. His image is assimilated to a variety of gods very much as Mark Antony's was. The frequent use of symbols of victory on these coins might suggest that they were made after Actium in 31 BC. But in 36 BC Agrippa, Octavian's principal general, won a great sea victory off Sicily against Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey the Great and another major player in the power politics of the early 30s BC. All these victory symbols could thus refer to this earlier victory, allowing all these coins to pre-date Actium.
