The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. ", " Interpretation of the scene is much disputed; there is no clear evidence that the head is decapitated but there are hints that it is.
