Separating the two animal groups is a diamond shaped element with double outline, filled with crossed lines. The elephants are shown with tusks, curving trunks, small ears, their body are filled with dots, and dots at the tips of the tail represent hair On the interior are two crocodiles shown from above, placed vertically, head to toe, their bodies filled with triangles representing scales, and two hippopotami, facing each other but with a cross-hatched triangular element depending from the rim between them. Their tusks are depicted; their bodies filled with chevrons. Separating the two animal groups is a plant motif on one side, and on the other, three nested zigzag, perhaps representing water. The scenes of the interior shows two of the most common and most feared animals of the Nilotic milieu for the Predynastic Egyptians: the hippopotamus and crocodile. On the exterior, the aurochsen and the elephant are their desert counterparts. Each animal was the most powerful force their respective ecological niches. The decoration on the bowl then would provide protection from or channel the power of these animals, and was a means of controlling the forces of nature. Navajas, however, suggests that these animals had a more political meaning, and represented the inhabitants of the respective areas where these animals might be found: for example, the elephant in Nubia, the aurochs in the western desert. This is the only vessel of the predynastic \u2018white cross line\u2019 class to depict elephants. Bibliography: E. R. Ayrton & W. L. S.
