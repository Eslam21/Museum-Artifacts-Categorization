The decorative motif finds parallels with Schlotzhauer's South Ionian little master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9C. Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana, Band, and Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. ", " Also treated by Emil Kunze in Ath.Mitt. 59 (1934) 93-4, Beilage 7, 3.
