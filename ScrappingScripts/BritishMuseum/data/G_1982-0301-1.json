{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1982,0301.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Harpocrates. The figure stands on a plain flat-faced plinth. He is almost entirely naked, with ahimation over his left shoulder, caught up by his left hand, to fall beside his left leg: there is a possibility that the drapery covers a pier on which he leans, but the details are unclear. His finger is to his mouth and he has a full head of hair, with a side-lock falling on to his right shoulder. He wears a tightly woven and bound wreath, with the lappets of its ribbon draped over his shoulders. Surmounting the wreath is a Double Crown. He holds a cornucopia in the crook of his left arm. The back is plain, with a small roughly circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould: the back and front pieces of the figure are not quite in register. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt; the front of the figure bears substantial traces of a white dressing, with pink paint on the lower part of the himation, on the cornucopia and on the wreath.
