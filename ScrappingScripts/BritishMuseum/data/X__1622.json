This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to Ashmolean registers from 'from the Hellenion precinct (area 14), under wall of 2nd temple'. However Gutch publishes this as from '9 (see plan) 2 ft. above the mud' (Gutch 1898-9, 81 no. 25, pl. X. no.21, note, published as no.21 in plate, but no.25 in text). Gutch dates this to 500 BC - 450 BC (ibid. 81, no. 25). Ashmolean have this dated as 500BC - 470BC. Likely local made, though similar Greek influenced pieces were also produced in Persian Period Memphis and now in the Petrie Museum. Egyptian plaque figures wearing Greek dress are rare, but show clear Classical Greek influences. Rare examples from Naukratis that may be from similar figurine types include head fragments wearing polos of a classical Greek date and influence (Oxford, AN1896-1908-G.78; Cambridge NA368) and plaques of the dress only (Cambridge NA329, NA330), that may be later. One example is shown with nude male child, like types of P-F.1.1 (Cambridge NA 632). One example was found in the Hellenion precinct below the 2nd temple phase, confirming a Late Archaic (or early Classical) date for this piece (Hogarth 1898/1899,81, no. 21, pl. X.21; Oxford AN1896-1908-G.78). One example attributed to Naukratis appears to represent a woman with the Greek \u2018melon\u2019 hair style typical on Tanagra figures of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC (Chicago E18841) and so is likely one of the latest of this type and of the figurines made using the mould-made plaque technique. Figures in a similar style wearing chiton found at Memphis and dated to the Ptolemaic period, but occasionally described as Male (Petrie UC47921, also UC48120, UC48119, UC47961, Dynasty 27 UC48095 in \u2018Persian headdress\u2019, UC48038 Greek male?). Male variants have been found at Memphis, dated to 27th Dynasty or second Persian period (UC47966, UC47964, UC47960, UC48447-9). Dating for this varied type is difficult as they are so rare and represent Greek subjects using an Egyptian medium. Some may have been made as early as the late 6th or 5th century BC, though later types continued into the 4th century BC and possibly into the 3rd century.
