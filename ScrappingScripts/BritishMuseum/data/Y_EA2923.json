{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA2923"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring: the bezel is lozenge shaped, its edge decorated with a double row of granules and its underside inscribed with a scorpion. On top squats a frog with solid cast body and added wire legs. The sides of the shank, which is of sheet metal over a core, are bound with gold wire, which passes through a cup at each end of the shank before passing through the length of the bezel to provide the swiveling mechanism.

The goddess Heqat, who participated in the creation, crouched beside the potter's wheel on which the ram god Khnum shaped mankind, was also a frog. Consequently this ring might have been worn to bestow on its owner fertility or resurrection. A scorpion, however, suggests it had a funerary purpose since this creature was the symbol of Serqet, one of the four goddesses who protected the dead and were particularly associated with the Four Sons of Horus and the embalmed internal organs.
