", " The goose, a sacred animal for Amun-Ra, or the duck is a regular theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie listed different variants with a goose or a duck as a central motif (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88; see also Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 34). This scaraboid belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 102, 106-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B32-35). On close compositions, the cross-shaped symbols are often replaced by a solar disk or a Maat feather. In these later cases especially, it is possible to recognise the name of Amun written in a cryptographic way (Drioton 1957, 17, no. 5).
