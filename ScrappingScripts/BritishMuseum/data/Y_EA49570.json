Rows of solid triangles, representing mountains are painted between the boats.

A band composed of six wavy lines divided into alternating long and short segments encircles the shoulder below the rim. Below, arranged between the handles (which are outlined with three painted strokes) are three boats with many oars, a double branch frond at the prow, and two central cabins to which a standard has been attached, each bearing a different emblem: a Z-motif or zigzag; a curved motif often identified as double horns; and crossed lines, identified with the crossed arrows, later known as the emblem of the goddess Neith. Above the boats stand human figures. 1) A single man facing right, holding a long curved staff. To the right, an antelope with twisted horns, identified as an addax, is painted above the stern of the boat. 2) A large female figure with arms raised above her head, with a smaller male figure on the left holding her arm. To the right, another male figure, facing right, holds a curved staff. 3) An addax, facing right, is painted above the cabins, and to the right, above the boat\u2019s stern a male figure facing right holds a long curved staff. Vertical and diagonal lines of s-motifs appear around the figures. Rows of solid triangles, probably representing mountains, appear between the boats. Similarities in the way the human figures are painted suggested to Smith that the hand of a single painter can be identified connecting this pot to other elaborately painted vessels in other museum.
