No less than six of them were discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41-42; Masson 2015). This figure could pertain to this hoard since it was discovered during the first season of excavation at Naukratis. This group-figure belongs to the type G12 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, Taf. 56). It became truly popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (for example: Grenier 2002, 51-58, pl. VIII-X; Goddio and Fabre 2008, 318-9 no. 178-180; Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314). Isis nursing is also a theme which is popular in other material in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b).
