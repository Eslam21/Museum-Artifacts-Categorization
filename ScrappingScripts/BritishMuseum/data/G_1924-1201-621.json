Scholtz suggests the inscription on this sherd may be a prostitute's erotically inflected pseudonym from the term 'iunx', which was an erotic charm used by Jason to seduce Medea in Pindar's fourth 'Pythian'.

The lack of decoration on the exterior surface of the sherd may be a result of the sherd's size. The decoration on the exterior surface of Simple Animal Style vases is not usually extensive and filling ornament, with the exception of a simple rim pattern, a single elaborate rosette and simple handle zone pattern, is absent."], "Bibliographic references": [" Gardner 1888 / Naukratis II (p. 63, no. 712, pl.
