{"artifact_name": "bead", "Object Type": ["bead"], "Museum number": ["EA86302"], "Description": [" several beads made of stone and faience A: barrel-shaped bead made of a black and white colour, one copper alloy fragment stuck to its surface, like a wire with a circular section, corroded and broken off. It has a length of 0.80 and thickness of 0.2 cm. A second patch at the surface shows remains of a second copper alloy fragment. B: small stone pebble with another copper alloy fragment stuck onto the surface, same thickness 0.2 cm as in A and length is 0.70 cm, as seen on the sketch originally joined to A C: six and a half small barrel-shaped beads made of faience, few remains of a whitish glaze, no colour preserved, most beads have no glazed preserved at all. One of the beads has few remains of copper alloy stuck onto the surface as well. This suggests that the whole assemblage was part of bracelet or something similar.
