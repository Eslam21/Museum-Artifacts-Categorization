The commemorative scarab series: asserting royal equality' Nile Magazine 29, 11-23 ", " Blankenberg-van Delden (1969) detailed that this scarab had been in the collection of a Mme Hoffmann by 1880, and cited in numerous publications from that point until the mid-1900s, by which time its location was unknown. The scarab reappeared at Sotheby's in 1974, when it was purchased by the British Museum. Key to confirmation that the 1974 acquisition was the 'Hoffmann Scarab' was the drawing published by Maspero (1893), reproduced by Blankenberg-van Delden (1969), and the following identifying information from the latter: \"in the first cartouche stp n Ra is added to the prenomen; in contrast to all other scarabs the title nsw bjt in line 4 on this scarab is followed by nb jrt xt; in perfect condition (at that time)\" A fuller provenance was published by Blankenberg-van Delden in 1976: \"location of find unknown; purchased in Egypt by a Mme Hoffmann ([Blankenberg-van Delden, 1969] pp. 161-2, pl. xxxiv); since then it was lost from sight; acquired by the British Museum at the Sotheby sale April 29, 1974, lot number 238. It is certain that, notwithstanding the differences in length and width, the British Museum scarab and Mme Hoffmann's specimen is one and the same. Emil Brugsch in 1880 made several paper squeezes of the Hoffmann scarab which he sent to his brother Heinrich Brugsch and G. Maspero. H. Brugsch published a text based on these squeezes in ZAS 18 (1880), 81, and Thesaurus 6 (1891), p. 1413, as did Maspero in Rec. Trav. 15 (1893), 200. Comparison points out the conformity. The deviation stp-n-ra [...] from tjt-ra may be due to misreading the squeeze. The mistake on the scarab in rendering rn (n jt.s) by [hieroglyphs, see publication for images] instead of by [hieroglyphs, see publication for images] was correctly copied by Maspero, and can be seen on the B.M. scarab. The difference in dimensions may also be due to the measuring of a paper squeeze.\" See also James, T. G. H. 1976. 'Egyptian antiquities'. The Classical tradition, 221-225.
