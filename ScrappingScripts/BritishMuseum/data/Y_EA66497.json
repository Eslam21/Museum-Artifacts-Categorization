This name is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 117-118; on the various productions of the factory, see Webb forthcoming). They belong to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and in South Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 103-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B16-23, see especially B16 for this piece). Let's note that the motif is incised, not stamped, so it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII. For a similar inscription on glazed composition scarabs found in Naukratis, see: Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.13; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.858. Various parallels: Fraser 1900, pl.
