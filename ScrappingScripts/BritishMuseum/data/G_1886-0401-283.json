The lack of rim and other diagonstic features makes it impossible to confirm the type to which the cup belongs. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 54, no. 17) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.260) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.283"]}
