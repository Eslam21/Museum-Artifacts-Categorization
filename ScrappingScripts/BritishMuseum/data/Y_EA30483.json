{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA30483"], "Description": [" Fish amulet: of gold with rock crystal or translucent chalcedony inlay. The inlay in the shape of a fish is unbroken. A band of gold foil across the front end is pressed down the sides of the cloison, and scraps remain by the head. Probably the whole stone inlay or at least the head was covered in gold foil. The striations on the fins and tail have been almost obliterated by rubbing. A striated ring for suspension is soldered to the front of the base-plate. The fins, tail and base-plate were cut from a single piece of sheet gold; the body cloison is a strip of gold soldered at right angles to the base-plate.
