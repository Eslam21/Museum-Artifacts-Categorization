", " Similar rim forms have been produced in Egypt since the Late Period, see for example 4th and 3rd to 1st century BC parallels (Nenna 2013, Fig. 6.4, T6.4). However, the paste and glaze is distinctly Roman, commonly dated 1st to 2nd century AD as on similar ledge rim bowls (Nenna 2013, T12.5 variant). Similar, but rare variants of this form have been found within late 1st to early 3rd century AD contexts at Mons Claudianus, probably produced in Memphis (Tomber 2006, types 4 to 10; Petrie 1909). Close parallels from workshop in Elephantine, Early Roman in date, and based on Italian Roman Red slipped tableware forms (Rodziewicz 2005, 28, pl. 12, no. 215).
