He is represented with a long wig falling down his back and wears a necklace, two bracelets and a white kilt. The scene is broken off on the side of his wife, but it is evident that she is embracing her husband lovingly. The wife usually played the part of Isis, by whose love Osiris was resurrected. It is to be noticed also that the man's skin is ochre, whereas that of his wife is lighter, in accordance with Egyptian artistic convention. Above the scene, there are four columns of hieroglyphics, in which the wife is described as \"the beloved one.\""}
