A fragment of a model of a dramatic mask, presumably tragic, but perhaps of a Satyr. Part only of its left side remains: a prominent nose and wide eye, a fierce eyebrow and a pointed ear, an open mouth drawn down at the corner, and straight radiating hair. The eyeball is pierced, and there is a hole through the ear. This hole and its lost companion were probably used to pin or hang it on a wall. The back is plain. Pushed into one-piece mould, then Red-brown slip added on front. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions.
