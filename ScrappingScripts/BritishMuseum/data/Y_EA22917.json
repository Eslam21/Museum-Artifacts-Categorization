{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA22917"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Nesmut: a small round-topped stela carrying one scene in which the deceased Nesmut, wearing a long gown with full sleeves covering apparent rolls of fat, stands on the right in adoration of Ra-Horakhty mummiform, who is enthroned on the left. Between them is an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Above are six columns of text with an invocation of Ra-Horakhty on behalf of Nesmut, daughter (?) of Ns-\u1e24wt-\u1e25r and a curved sky-sign. The ladies cannot be further identified. The stela is badly worn along the edges and surface, which is plastered, with loss to scene and text. The body of the lady is yellow, outlined in red, while her dress is outlined in red and blue on the white background of the stela. Her wig is black, her eye black on white, and her collar red with blue dots. The disk of the god is red with a white border and yellow uraeus edged in red. His face is white with features in red and a black beak. His wig is blue, collar grey with red lines, and sceptres grey and blue edged in red. His upper body is red with blue dots, while the lower is white edged in red. The throne is blue and red divided by white edged in red. The altar is blue and white with a grey pot outlined in red and a red-stemmed lotus with a grey flower. The figures rest on a green and blue base with white red-lined ties. The hieroglyphs are black on a grey background, while the sky-sign is blue.
