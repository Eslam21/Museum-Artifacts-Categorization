", " Protome bust (or \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of an early Classical Greek type. Fabric and style suggest an East Greece origin dated 500BC-425BC. Very similar, possibly from same mould as joining fragments from at least two protomes from the same mould were found at Naukratis in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology. The fragments include two heads (NA350 joins NA355; NA354 joins NA353) and 5 joining body fragments (NA390 joins NA850, NA426, NA803 and NA509). Close parallels, probably from the same mould, from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.120, no.2525, who notes three copies from the same mould, Type B2) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated mid 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 238, GR1885, 1213.41). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the early and late 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
