{"artifact_name": "offering-table", "Object Type": ["offering-table"], "Museum number": ["EA94"], "Description": [" Black granite offering-table of Amasis: in the centre of the slab are representations of the sorts of foodstuffs which might be expected to be offered; here we see two symmetrical ranges of jars, loaves, cakes and fowl framed on either side by tall libation jars and placed on a reed mat. Around the outside of the food representations is a line of hieroglyphs running clockwise around the table, with a prayer for offerings of a variety of items in the classic Egyptian measure of a thousand of each. Further from the viewer is a stylized loaf on the table, which gives the object the shape of the hieroglyph 'hetep' \"offerings;\" through the middle of this loaf runs a small channel which was probably to allow water poured as libations over the offerings to run away. The name of the king for whom this was set up has been erased, but it is evidently Amasis.

The cause of this revolt by the Egyptians was that Apries was thought to be giving too much preference to the Greeks and Carians who were becoming increasingly numerous in Egypt. The residence of the 26th Dynasty was at Sais where this table is supposed to have been found. The tombs of the kings are also reputed to have been at Sais (Herodotus II, 169) but have never been discovered. It is possible that this slab was intended either for an offering or even tomb-chapel of the king, or that it was placed in the main temple at the site dedicated to the goddess Neith. The reason for the erasure of the name is uncertain. Either a later king was planning to reuse the slab, or else (perhaps) a disgruntled descendant of Apries might have damaged it in retribution for Amasis' coup. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
