{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.105"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Bes. Bes seated on the capital of a column, naked, with his hands on his knees; he wears a feathered headdress. The shaft of the column is broken away below its upper double moulding, how much is lost is unknown. The capital has one complete leaf in the centre, and probably half leaves on each side, it may be meant to represent an Egyptian palm-leaf capital, rather than a Corinthian one. The back is plain, except for an expanding element behind the feathers of the crown, which is pierced at the top, perhaps to hold a stick of incense. Hollow, from two-piece mould, with the remains of a white dressing on the front. Bes\u2019s flesh is painted red, and there are traces of blue on the left shoulder; the capital appears to have been painted very pale-pinkish beige. Brown Nile silt with a grey-brown core and abundant fine gold mica and sparse white inclusions. The hollow underneath is filled with modern plaster, presumably for a stand.

Similar Bes figures have been found in Ptolemaic contexts, or dated to the Roman period (Bailey 2008, 38; Dunand 1990, 42-3, no. 42-45; Gutch 1898\u20139, 95n. 5). A similar example found at Naukratis (British Museum GR1886,0401.1455), was previously considered to be late 6th century BC in date and made in Naukratis (Walters 1903, C 594; Higgins 1954: no. 1546). Though the fabric is consistent with Nile Delta kiln products, it is impossible to confirm a Naukratis origin for it. Dunand, F. 1990. Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.
