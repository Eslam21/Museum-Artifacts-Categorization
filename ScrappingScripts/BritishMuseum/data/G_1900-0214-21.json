{"artifact_name": "relief", "Object Type": ["relief"], "Museum number": ["1900,0214.21"], "Description": [" Unfinished warrior relief of a probably previous architectural frieze. The fragment shows an armed man walking to the right with a crested Corinthian helmet, spear and a shield held out in front of him, whereby the inner side is being shown. The rear leg has the heel raised and shows the scratched outline of a greave which does not appear on the other leg. At top and bottom was a moulding, now broken away, and with imperfect slab. The relief is in a low single plane, carefully smoothed and flat, save that the calves are slightly rounded. No traces of inner detail save the scratched greave that is visible. Around are deep grooved outlines and the background is smoothed. The outlines extend beyond the shaft of the spear on the left. The slab has certainly been left unfinished, as the right edge is imperfectly tooled, and only a beginning has been made on the left, while the back is rough. On the other hand, the smoothness of relief and background suggests that the front is to be regarded as finished and that details were added in colour.

The relief is certainly of the archaic period and in view of its curious technique may well be early. L. Curtius, comparing it with the well- known Euphorbos plate from Rhodes (Salzmann, Necr. de Camiros, pl. .53), assigns it to the seventh century B.C. Comparison may also be made with the East side of the Xanthian Lion Tomb (Sculpture B286), which shows the same flat relief, but appears more advanced. (Koneigs 2007, 346f. Cat. 45) Both Edgar1898/99 and Koenigs 2007 argue for the relief originally being part of an architectural frieze. See C.C. Edgar, \"Excavations at Naukratis, C.
