The owner of the stela, the scribe Tuthmosis, is depicted in raised relief on the right in front of an offering table and a seated Osiris. Underneath is the classic scene with the offering table: his father Si-Amun and his mother Nebt-nuhe are sitting in front of an offering table, under which sits the daughter of Tuthmosis, Eset. Facing them are Tuthmosis and his wife Tjef. The inscription, in six horizontal lines near the bottom, invokes all kinds of offerings for the Ka of Tuthmosis."}
