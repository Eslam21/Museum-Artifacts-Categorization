John Gere was the first to point out that it was more likely Genoese, provisionally suggesting that it was by Domenico Piola. Yvonne Tan Bunzl first proposed the idea that it was by Gregorio de Ferrari (note on mount), an idea endorsed by Piero Boccardo and Mary Newcome. The latter in her monograph dates it on stylistic grounds to c. 1675 on the basis of similarities in movement and composition with the painter's two works in San Siro, Genoa, 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' and 'Ectasy of St Francis' (Newcome Schleier 1998, nos. 10 and 13). Label text from Nativity show: The dramatic possibilities of Christ's nocturnal birth are explored in this work by the Genoese artist De'Ferrari. The composition is flooded with light from Christ. This has a symbolic importance because it relates to Christ's description of his mission: 'I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness' (John XII: 46). Label text, 'Genoa, Superb Line' (2023-4): This is a stunning example of Gregorio's manipulation of light for dramatic effect, a light that is given the added symbolic weight of Christ's description of his mission: 'I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness' (John XII: 46). This is probably a design for a now lost painting. On stylistic grounds it can be dated relatively early, when Gregorio's work reflected his admiration for the ecstatic religiosity of Antonio Correggio's nocturnal paintings of the 1520s and 30s.
