As further humiliation, the monkey wears a colourful patched costume usually associated with the comic figure of Harlequin. Gilbert Pidcock (1743\u20131810) was the owner of a collection of animals, known as the Royal Menagerie, which included lions, tigers, beavers, ostriches and other wild birds and animals. It toured all across the country, but from 1793 was based in an exhibition hall in London\u2019s Strand. This printed image was first published in 1803, however, in this later print, the satirist has adapted the words to associate it with the political events leading up to the abdication of Napoleon. Pidcock announces, \u201cThis surprising Animal was taken by John Bull and his Allies... But Bull and Co. coming up with him by break of day, compelled him to surrender, and transported him to Hell Bay.\u201d \u2018Hell Bay\u2019 was a popular reference to the Island of Elba, where Napoleon was exiled in 1814.
