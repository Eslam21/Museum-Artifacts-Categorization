The boat is not like any other kind of boat; it has neither sail nor oars and it has no crew. On the boat are two rectangular objects and a cylindrical one, over which is a statuette of the falcon god Horus. These objects are painted in red and yellow. In the front of the boat are six feathers of Maat, the goddess of justice, and another rectangular object, in the shape of a sarcophagus surrounded by black rods. The bow and stern of the boat are not like those used in daily life."}
