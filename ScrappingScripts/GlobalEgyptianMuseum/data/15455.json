{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 46216", "Dating": "4TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "RESERVE HEAD", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "19.5 cm", "Name": "Reserve Head", "Description": "The reserve heads display a natural grandeur and are all fully shaven, as if they wore skullcaps, so that it is often difficult to distinguish between male and female portraits. This head, which depicts a member of Chephren's family, is characteristic of this type of sculpture. The eyes continue towards the nose in deeply cut lines. The eyebrows and high cheekbones are in raised relief. The typical nose and the slightly frowning mouth add to the realistic character of this portrait of a self-assured member of the upper classes."}
