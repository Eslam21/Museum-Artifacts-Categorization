{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA24619"], "Description": [" Calcite figure of a royal (?) woman: neither this woman's dress nor her attitude reveal whether she is a commoner or a member of the royal family. Her full breasts, flat abdomen (but for the slight mound below the navel), and, in profile, the firm, protruding buttocks and full thighs all seem to belong to a nubile young woman. The slight roughening of the surface around the wrists, for wide bracelets, and at the neck, for a deep collar - unnecessary preparations if paint were to be applied - probably indicate that gold leaf or foil was affixed to these areas, also favoring a royal attribution. She wears a tripartite wig. There is curtain-like rendering of the woman's natural hair at her forehead beneath her wig. In its expression the full face is extremely gentle. The large eyes are almond shaped, and a horizontal incision accentuates the corners. The upper eyelids are indicated by a fine fold, and the eyebrows are barely suggested. The nose is wide and the mouth soft, with full lips that seem to bear the trace of a smile. WIth their unusually supple fingers and nails carefully defined, the hands give an impression of extreme refinement.

The fine modeling and the sensitivity to the subtle forms of the woman's body may imply that the statue was a product of a royal studio. Beyond the excellent quality of the carving, the proposed royal attribution is also suggested by the type of stone from which it is carved. Initially, at least, white calcite appears to have been restricted to royal use. See B. Porter & R.
