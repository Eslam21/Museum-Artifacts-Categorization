", " The size of the sherd, the lack of diagnostic details and the absence of decoration on the exterior surface make it impossible to determine whether it came from a kantharos or a chalice. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration. Kantharoi Type B1 have lotus flowers and lotus buds on the interior above two concentric white bands (Williams 1983, 169) and many kantharoi Type B have painted inscriptions beneath the rim; several have been found on Aegina as well as at Naukratis.
