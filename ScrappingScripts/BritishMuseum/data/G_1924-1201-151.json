Goats typically fall out of favour after the Wild Goat Style in circa 610BC but they do surface occasionally on later chalices as well. For example, London UCL 167 and Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA72 and NA103. The rim pattern, the lack of filling ornament and the interior decoration are all consistent with the Simple Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
