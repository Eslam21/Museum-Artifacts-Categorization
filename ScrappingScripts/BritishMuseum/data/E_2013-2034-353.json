Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933.
