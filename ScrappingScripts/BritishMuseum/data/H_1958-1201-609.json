The dial does not belong to the dial plate, there being numerous unused holes for the original dial. A soldered hinge element in the dial plate replaces the former hinge element crudely filed away on the movement front plate. This suggests aswell that the movement does not belong to the present dial plate or the inner case. The pendant is a later replacement for an original with loose ring. The outer case, being cast silver is very likely to have been made in Geneva."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": [" Latest: 5 (2015) active rust on steel parts and chain, verdigris ", " 4 (1994) Rust on steel parts "], "Associated names": ["Repaired by: William Orme"], "Associated places": [" Repaired in: Dinting Vale "], "Associated events": ["Associated Event: Flight into Egypt"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Courtenay Adrian Ilbert"], "Acquisition date": ["1958"], "Department": ["Britain, Europe and Prehistory"], "Registration number": ["1958,1201.609"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: B9 (Ilbert Ledger) ", " Previous owner/ex-collection number: CAI.0609 (Ilbert Collection) "], "Conservation": ["C&W Treatment"]}
