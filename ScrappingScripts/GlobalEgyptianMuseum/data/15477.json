The chiton is a knee-length garment and the himation is a rectangular cloth draped over the left shoulder and wrapped about the body.The modius is a turban-shaped measure of grain symbolizing fertility. The front of the modius is decorated with a disk and three erect branches, rather deeply cut and not stuccoed. There is also a small circular hole above the central branch. At least part of this ornamentation probably was originally inlaid. The eyes are also inlaid and are composed of white stone; the iris, which was inserted separately, is made of dark material. Part of the hair has been added in plaster; the back is left somewhat rough and flat. The bust is covered with a coat of white plaster on which the paint was applied. Remains of black on the hair, eyebrows, and drapery and traces of red on the lips are still visible."}
