Petrie noted four scarabs with the same motif as this scarab (published in Petrie 1886, pl. 37, no. 57). It belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A140-148, see especially A141 for this piece). Gorton, A.
