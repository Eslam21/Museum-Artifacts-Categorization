This animal symbolises Wadjet, the goddess of Lower Egypt, assimilated with the fiery eye of the sun. It is for this reason that the uraeus adorns the brow of the farao and that it is often crowned with a solar disk. It also served to protect precious objects like the chapels and naos of the temple. It is possible that this exemplar once decorated a royal head. "}
