{"artifact_name": "jar-sealing", "Object Type": ["jar-sealing"], "Museum number": ["EA22002"], "Description": [" A domed mud sealing from a small jar: the upper shape of the pot survives underneath; it was a closed vessel with only the start of the neck, the upper part of which was presumably broken away at some time before it was sealed. The aperture was first closed by a wad of textile, probably linen, with at least two pieces of fabric joined by a roughly sewn seam, and then the wet clay was added, shaped, and stamped ten times round the edges with the same intaglio gem. The impressions are rather blurred, but appear to show a draped woman standing to right holding a vessel in front of her. Micaceous grey-brown Nile mud, unfired.
