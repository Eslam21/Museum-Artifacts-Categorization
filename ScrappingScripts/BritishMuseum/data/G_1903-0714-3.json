{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1903,0714.3"], "Description": [" Head of terracotta bearded soldier. A head of a bearded man, broken from a figure, with stylized beard and features, wearing a conical cap or helmet. It may be hand-modelled but was probably made in a two-piece mould, with the beard added and other manipulations effected, such as the piercing of the nostrils. Light-brown clay with no visible mica, covered with a white dressing, and with substantial remains of pink paint on the flesh. Black paint outlines the eyes, colours the beard, edges the cap and remains as a couple of vertical lines on the cap. Black paint was also used to indicate the upper edge of a garment, but some of it is restoration. Other black splodges on the object appear to have nothing to do with its decoration, but were probably acquired fortuitously. .
