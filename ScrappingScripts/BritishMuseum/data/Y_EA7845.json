{"artifact_name": "amulet", "Object Type": ["amulet"], "Museum number": ["EA7845"], "Description": [" Glazed composition quadruple 'wedjat'-eye amulet: this openwork multiple 'wedjat' eye amulet is made from green glazed composition with black glaze for the pupils and eyebrows; the back is flat and undetailed. Its design comprises four 'wedjats', two at the top and two at the bottom, in mirror image and separated by two horizontal papyrus columns, head to head, pierced from end to end, so the amulet could be worn. The papyrus was a symbol of regeneration. Each 'wedjat' resembles a human eye and eyebrow but beneath is the drop and curl, which are the distinguishing markings of the lanner falcon's eye.
