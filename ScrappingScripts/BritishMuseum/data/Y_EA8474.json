{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8474"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Irtyru: there are three sections to this round-topped stela. In the upper register, below a curved sky-sign, is a winged sun-disk with uraei beneath which is an 'wedjat'-eye. In the middle register the deceased stands on the right in an attitude of worship with the goddess of the West and Anubis behind him. In front of him is an altar on which rests a lotus. On the other side of the altar stand Ra and the four sons of Horus. The names of the last two are inverted. In the third register are five lines of text with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty on behalf of Irtyru, son of Iw\u02bfn\u1e2b. The stela has suffered loss from gouges on the surface. The stela is also cracked in places. It has been darkened, making the text difficult to read. Some of the text has been partially restored from a copy made byBirch during last century. The original background appears to have been buff. The sky-sign was blue. The disk is red with blue upper wings, having pink patches and edged in red, and green lower wings edged in red.
