{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86699"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with two slightly rounded impressions at the rear which might be from a basket as well, but in comparison these impressions are not as clear as the others described above. The dark brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica and small charcoal bits. The clay was hardened after excavation. The front shows finger impressions as well as the impression of a scarab-like seal. The seal motif consists of a circumferential line, a nfr-sign on the left, a seated baboon right of it, facing to the left, with a moon crescent (N12b) above his head. Behind him a lying ram with a double feather crown with uraei hanging from it, behind his back further illegible sign.
