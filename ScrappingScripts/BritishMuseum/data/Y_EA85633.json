{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85633"], "Description": [" Part of a figurine or a vessel in the shape of an animal head, probably a bovide. The clay is fired and shows some voids from chaff, the object had originally a red slip that is mostly eroded now. The ears are partly chipped off, preserved until the neck where the head was attached to the vessel or main body of the object. The part under the chin is reinforced by additional clay. The mouth is pierced and also in the end of the neck a small perforation is visible, not clear if these two holes are joint especially as the holes are very thin. If so the water would have run out of the mouth of the bovide.
