{"artifact_name": "stamp", "Object Type": ["stamp"], "Museum number": ["EA18160"], "Description": [" A rectangular terracotta bread-stamp, with an applied rectangular grip on the centre back. It has an incuse pattern: within a frame of mouldings, bead-and-reel and dentils (on opposing sides), and large ovolos, a gryphon stands to right (in the impression), with right foreleg extended, its wings recurve. It is of attenuated feline form, with an arched neck and a crested eagle's head; a snake's head at the tip of the tail may be fortuitous. One corner is broken away. Pressed over a modelled form. Red-brown Nile silt, with a little mica. Face varnished in modern times for an impression to be taken and released. Also with impression.
