", " Padibastet (Petoubastis) is a royal name for three pharaohs between the 23rd and 26th dynasty, as well as a common private name during the Late Period (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 283). This name is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). They usually belong to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and in South Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 103-107, type XXVIII B, see especially subtype B16-23), though this type concerns normally only glazed composition scarabs and not Egyptian blue ones. This scarab actually belongs to her type XXX A, type widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites, and in Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX A, subtype A19-31, see especially A31 for this specimen). The motifs in her type XXX A are similar to the ones found for her type XXVIII A, but they are roughly carved on coloured pastes and especially Egyptian blue (Gorton 1996, 109-111). For a similar inscription on a scarab in glazed composition found at Naukratis: Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.858. A stone scarab from Naukratis bears also this inscription (Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 70). Various parallels: Fraser 1900, pl. XIV, 407-408; Vercoutter 1945, 103-104, 36-39; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 282-283, 455-458. Fraser, G. 1900.
