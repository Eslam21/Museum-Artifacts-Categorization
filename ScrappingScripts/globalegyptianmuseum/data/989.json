{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6194", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HARP", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Width": "144 cm", "Depth": "12.2 cm", "Name": "Harp", "Description": "This instrument is a so-called shoulder harp, carried by Egyptian musicians on their left shoulders. This type of harp originally consisted of a body, a stick to stretch the strings, a skin that acted as a sounding board, and a handle. The Brussels specimen is characterised by a stretcher that is held in place on one side by a ring that was attached to a knob on the front of the body of the instrument, and on the other side by being wedged under the back of the body. This enabled the musician to adjust the tension of the strings and thus the pitch. The harp originally had four strings. Neither the strings, the screws nor the stick that acted as the stretcher have been preserved."}
