It likely totaled over 14m in length. The French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero (1889, 512) suggests that it may have been found in the Royal Cache in Deir el-Bahari but sold by looters before formal excavations began. Photographs of the papyrus in London and Paris were shown to Maspero in 1877. The coffins and mummy of Nedjmet were found during the official opening of the cache in 1881. A second book of the dead papyrus is also attributed Nedjmet (EA10490). Nedjmet is one of very few owners of a Book of the Dead about whose life we know any details; she was married to King Herihor (1070 BCE), shown prominently in the vignettes, and was also the mother of a king. Surviving letters on papyrus (P. Berlin 10489) written by her son, the powerful army commander Piankh, show that she was involved in the political murder of two policemen who had made rebellious speeches. Referenced: Regulski, I.
