It bears a scene in shallow sunk relief, without inscriptions. The relief has been divided over two registers, each with a base line in raised relief of c. 1 cm in width. The first register shows three men preserved up to their knees. The first man on the left has both his feet on the ground. Of his kilt only the fan-shaped billowing apron can be seen. He is holding a stick in his right hand. Of the second man only his legs remain, and the third man has his back foot raised. In front of each of the first two men is a pedestal, perhaps an altar. The second register has two bulls and a man carrying a knife. To the left lies a butchered bull, of which only the back half has been preserved. The right front leg has already been severed, and the head has also disappeared."}
