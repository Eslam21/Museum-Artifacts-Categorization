{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA700"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Tunennekhebkhons: on the top of this round-topped stela is depicted a winged sun-disk carved in raised relief. Below, in sunk relief, the metal-engraver Tunennekhebkhons holds an offering before an altar piled with other offerings to the god Osiris who stands on the left. Behind the owner of the stela stands his wife the chantress of Amun Henuttaneb, with her arms raised in worship. Seven columns of texts are incised above them, and three lines of text below the scene contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty, Osiris and Anubis on behalf of Tunennekhebkhons and his wife. There are a few gouges along the edges and on the surface. The lower right side has become darker than the rest of the stela. There are traces of red paint on the lower left edge, although this may not be original.
