{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1912:176", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "CARNELIAN", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Fine carnelian scarab, symbol of regeneration, found in the intact burial of a woman, in one of four chambers cut from a shaft in the rock, beneath the largest of a series of 12th Dynasty offering-chapels in the middle of the north cemetery at Abydos ('cemetery S'). The wing-cases of the scarab are marked as a single T-line over the back, and the notches at the front of the head mark in naturalistic style the edge of the beetle's headplate. Such details are characteristic of hard semi-precious stone scarabs at the peak of production in the 12th Dynasty. Other items of jewellery buried with the woman and in the plundered burials in the same shaft tomb, are also now in Dublin, numbers NMI 1912.173 to 181."}
