", " Fabric suggests this may be local. There are no identical Egyptian types, though 1st century (mostly late) AD examples are in the British Museum (Bailey 1988, nos Q1922-44, Q1917 and Q1920) are similar. Probably an imitation of Cnidus Broneer type XXI, see also Bailey (Bailey 1988, British Museum Lamps III, Q2702-7 and Q2744-5 for plant decoration). A similar example from Malta is given early 2nd century date by Bailey (Ibid. Q1863). Probably dated between 70AD and 100AD, though possibly made until the early 2nd century AD.
