Maria della Salute, Venice. A comparable example from this group by Giovanni Battista, that also highlights the slightly heavier touch of Domenico in the use of pen in the present study, is found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, see J. Bean and W. Griswold, '18th century Italian drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art', New York, 1990, no. 234, p. 242. Lit.: R.

Schilling was born in Germany and came to Britain in 1937 after the rise of the Nazis. He was prominent as a specialist in German Old Master drawings and his widow\u2019s bequest in his memory was predominantly made up of studies that he had collected in this field. Given its importance, the Museum accepted the bequest for public benefit in good faith, and has afterwards researched its history, insofar as it has been able. There remain however many works in the bequest with uncertain or incomplete provenance for the years 1933-45 and the Museum welcomes information and assistance in the investigation and clarification of the provenance of these works during that era. This drawing was acquired by Edmund Schilling for a small album (no.20) that he compiled for his wife, Rosi Schilling (see for further details 1997,0713.1; for the original album, see 159.b.28)."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1997,0712.51"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 29 May 1997"]}
