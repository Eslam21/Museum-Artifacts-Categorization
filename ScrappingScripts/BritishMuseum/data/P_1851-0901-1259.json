The New Spanish Encyclopaedia. Edit. 1808.\" Napoleon's flaming nest is the terrestrial globe, resting on sheaves of bayoneted muskets laid on a flat-topped pinnacle inscribed 'Pyrenean Mountains'. Clouds and crags frame the design. The phoenix, with flaming wings, has the head of Napoleon, turned in profile to the left. He is terror-stricken; his blazing crown flies upwards from his head; his predatory claws are raised in horror; from one his sceptre falls, from the other the orb. He wears a high military collar; round his neck is a tricolour'Cordon d'Honor' fringed with daggers. On the globe is a map of countries surrounding the Mediterranean, the central spot being 'Corsica'. The burning countries are 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'France', 'Sicily' [south of Corsica], 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Turkey'. At the base of the globe is the north of 'Africa' with 'Morocco' and 'Algiers' [in flames]. Above the flames by which Napoleon is surrounded are heavy clouds; from above these emerges a dove holding an olive branch, its wings inscribed 'Peace on Earth'. It is irradiated, rays descending from behind the clouds. 2 August 1808 Hand-coloured etching "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: James Gillray ", " Published by: Hannah Humphrey "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1808"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 360 millimetres ", " Width: 265 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.
