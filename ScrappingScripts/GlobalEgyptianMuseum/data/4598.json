The small head has bored, close-set eye sockets, presumably once inlaid with bone. In the middle of the underside are two holes 1 cm deep, bored for legs made of a different material.Prehistoric stone falcons of this size are only seldom seen. They were probably placed on palace fa\u00c3\u00a7ade stelae, where they are known to us from depictions and small three-dimensional models. This was the first form of the Horus name of the king."}
