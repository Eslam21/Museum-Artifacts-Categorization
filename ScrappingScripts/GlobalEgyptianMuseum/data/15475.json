{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 38043", "Dating": "25TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "50.8 cm", "Name": "Statue of Djed-ist-iufankh, Son of Khensmosi", "Description": "This standing statue is composed of three fragments with a modern restoration bridging the missing portion between the torso and the feet. The head has been directly reattached to the torso. Djed-ist-iufankh holds an offering table mounted on a pillar placed between his feet; the left foot is forward. His horizontally pleated skirt, girded by an undecorated belt, was common during the New Kingdom. The torso is that of a well-conditioned athlete, with a slender waist, powerful chest, and broad shoulders. The upper half of the back pillar bears a single column of inscription. The square base is inscribed only on its upper surface. The shaven head of Djed-ist-iufankh is rendered in a strikingly natural manner. The face is deeply lined, suggesting an older, dour man."}
