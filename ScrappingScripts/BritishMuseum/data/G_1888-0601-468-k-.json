The lotus flower and bud pattern found on these vessels appears on the exterior surface of the vases and in the later vases the pattern resembles that found on Fikellura vases. However, the same pattern also features on the cul of Wild Goat Style chalices, to which this sherd bears closer similarities. See Lemos no. 114 from Emporio. Whilst the heavy chalice does not typically appear as early as in the Wild Goat Style, the thickness of this sherd suggests that it comes from a vessel much larger than a chalice. Perhaps this sherd marks a transition from the Wild Goat Style to the Mature Animal Style."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1532) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.468.k.+"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 1924,1201.530 (Re-registered in error.)
