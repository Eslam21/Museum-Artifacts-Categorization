The earlobes are pierced. The dark hair falls in rounded waves onto the shoulders. A monochrome green cap covers the hair on the head and is pulled low on the forehead. The shoulders still show traces of a cape with the representation of a large plant and two gazelles opposite each other. The shape of the cape suggests that the arms were originally stretched out in front of the figure."}
