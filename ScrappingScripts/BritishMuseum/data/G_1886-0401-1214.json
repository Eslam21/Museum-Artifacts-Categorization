Br. Mus.), however, they are no longer preserved. Due to the straight lines and the joint area only two interpretations are possible: the ovolo moulding belongs either to the bottom of a volute acroterion of an altar, which would be double as thick as the moulding of fragment B 419, or it was a mending piece for a middle sized Ionic capital. The latter is very unlikely (Koenigs 2007)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Sculpture / Catalogue of Greek Sculpture in the British Museum (B428) ", " Koenigs 2007 / Archaische griechische Bauteile (Cat. no.35, p.337, fig. 6.)
