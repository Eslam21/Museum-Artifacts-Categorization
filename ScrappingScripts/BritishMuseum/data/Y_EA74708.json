{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA74708"], "Description": [" Portrait of a man in encaustic on limewood: the panel is cut down at the sides as well as at the top. A crack extends from top to bottom through the centre. The lower part was left unpainted. The surface of this expressive portrait was worked with a spatula, and the background is more thickly rendered with brush-strokes than is usual. The wax was remelted by Petrie, and a thin coat of paraffin wax was applied to conserve the surface. The mummy was wrapped in coarse linen, which has left diagonal impressions framing the portrait, so only the face and upper neck were visible. The hair, black and cropped close to the head, is very similar to Roman court portraiture of the Trajanic period, as is the shape and contouring of the face, which confronts the viewer directly in the Roman manner. Short black brushstrokes on the chin may indicate stubble. The outline of the face is drawn in reddish brown, also used to part the lips. The face is painted in ochre and burnt sienna tones, with highlights in pink and cream. The brown eyes are deeply recessed and shaded.

The Romanised appearance could indicate high social status, but the overall impression (somewhat lessened by inconfident painting of his left ear) is of maturity and physical strength, the latter expressed in the rugged physique and sunburned countenance.
