", " \"Naukratis 1888\" written in black ink on base, so the amulet comes from the early excavations of the site by Petrie or Gardner. Cats are usually associated with the goddess Bastet, a deity particularly revered in Lower Egypt (Kessler 1989, 150-154). The goddess was linked with fertility but also festivity and drunkenness (Andrews 1994, 32). Bastet is relatively well-represented at Naukratis with some figures and amulets in bronze and glaze composition (Masson forthcoming). Even if they appear already previously, amulets of cat started to be very popular with the Third Intermediate Period (on amulets of cat in general: Andrews 1994, 12, 33-34; Herrmann et al. 2010, 89-90).
