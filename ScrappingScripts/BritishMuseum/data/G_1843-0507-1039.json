{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1836,0224.455"], "Description": [" Roman terracotta lamp with an Egyptianizing scene: only the rear and upper part of the body are ancient: the nozzles are restored (but wrongly angled) in fired clay; the underside is completed with the base of an ancient pot.The pierced handle-ornament of this very large lamp shows an obelisk with indications of hieroglyphs, including a royal cartouche. It is flanked by Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of writing and the recording of history, and the ever popular child god, Harpocrates. Seshat wears a long tunic (chiton) and shawl (himation), and a headdress, partially restored, apparently of bird form. She holds a looped garland or perhaps a pen in her right hand and a palm-branch in her left; from her left wrist hangs an inkwell. Harpocrates is naked, with his right hand to his mouth, and has the sidelock of male childhood. In his left hand he holds the royal crook and flail, and perhaps a feather; he wears a crown of horizontal ram's horns surmounted by a sun disc flanked by leaves. Behind him is a tall basket containing ring-shaped objects. Directly below the plinth of the obelisk is a hawk with wings displayed but drooping; on the stem of the handle-ornament are three lotus flowers. This scene is incongruously matched with a representation of Hercules and the Nemean Lion on the top of the lamp. The lamp is covered with an orange to brown slip.
