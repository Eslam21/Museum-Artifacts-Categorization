{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1440"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of satyr. The upper part of an elderly satyr, broken from a figure, probably reclining. He is balding, with a generous beard, and his right arm is extended downwards: it is lost below the elbow. He probably leans on his left elbow, but the arm is broken away above it; a himation falls off his left shoulder, covering his arm, and part of it can be seen close to his body, under his right arm. The rear of the figure has come away at the join. Hollow, from two-piece mould, with traces of a white dressing survive; there may be red paint on his beard, but it may just be the surface of the fabric. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant mica and white inclusions.
