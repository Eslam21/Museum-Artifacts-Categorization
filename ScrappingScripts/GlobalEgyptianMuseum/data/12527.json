The middle and left vignettes show the same scene, the uraeus is absent in the left one. Legenda are written in the vignettes.The representation on the inside is rotated 90 degrees in respect to the outside: Isis and Nephthys bewail a multicoloured Djed-pillar, crowned with a sun-disk.

On the head, the goddesses carry the hieroglyph for their names. The background colour of this scene is red."}
