{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.111"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Isis. A large figure of \u2018Isis-Aphrodite anasyr(o)mene\u2019, perhaps Isis-Bubastis, holding up the front of her tunic to show her pubic area; the back of the garment falls in curved folds of drapery beside her legs. She stands on a small, roundfronted, inadequate plinth. Her hair is parted in the middle and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears large earrings and an enormous wreath with decorative elements, including discs with raised points, bound across the front with a narrow horizontal garland tied at each side; leaves fall beside her upper arms, below these leaves hang wide ribbons from the headdress. From the top of the wreath rises a large flaring kalathos, decorated with long tongues or petals and an Isis/Hathor-crown of cow\u2019s horns, disc and feathers. The back is largely plain, with summary incuse indications, formed in the mould, of drapery low down, a horizontal jog at the lower level of the headdress, and a small circular vent, slightly off centre. A few traces of a white dressing on the front and red paint on headdress. Hollow, made in a two-piece mould, with a vent in the back. Orange-brown Nile Delta silt fabric with a red-brown surface and abundant gold mica , quartz and some white inclusions. Broken in half, and repaired recently.

Parallel dated first half of first century AD (head and shoulder fragment without a kalathos, Philipp 1972, figs 19 and 20).
