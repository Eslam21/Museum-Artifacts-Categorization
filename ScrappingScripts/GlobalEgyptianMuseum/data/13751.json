{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "736", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTOR'S MODEL", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "10.4 cm", "Name": "Model of a kig's head", "Description": "Models of heads, hands, feet, torsos and other parts of the body were used by ancient Egyptian sculptors both for teaching purposes and as studies for manufacturing statues. This model represents a king's head with a royal head cloth and uraeus on it. The face is elongated, the bridge of the nose is very thin, the eyebrows and upper and lower eyelids are marked by cosmetic lines, the mouth is large and full, with a slight smile. These features are characteristic of the Ptolemaic sculpture, while the shape of the uraeus with two bends forming a horizontal figure of eight and its very long body reaching the crown of the head and slightly deviating rightwards shifts the dating to the second part of the period."}
