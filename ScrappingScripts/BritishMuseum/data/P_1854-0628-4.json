The composition is based on a Veronese drawing in Cleveland. The present drawing probably served as a model for Veronese's painting of the subject, now in Ottawa, although there are a number of differences (Pignatti, II, fig. 689). A more faithful painted version of the drawing by a follower of Veronese is in the High Museum of Art, Atlanta (Pignatti, II, fig. 721). Van Dyck made a copy of the present drawing, see 1957,1214.207.2. Another copy with an old attribution to Erasmus Quellinus but offered as Hans Rottenhammer was sold at Sotheby's, New York, 30 January 2019, lot 9. Lit.: G.
