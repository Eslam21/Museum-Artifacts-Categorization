{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA11131"], "Description": [" Bronze figure of Isis seated and suckling Harpocrates: Isis, the archetypal mother goddess, is represented characteristically as a woman presenting her breast to suckle her son who sits on her lap. She must once have sat on a separately made bronze low backed throne. Her eyes are gilded and her eyebrows are of lighter coloured copper. Over her heavy wig she wears a carefully delineated vulture headdress; the bird's head at her forehead is an insignia only worn by queens and goddesses. A circle of upreared cobras' form a 'modius', which is surmounted by cow's horns and sun disc, the goddess' typical head adornment and a reminder that Isis could take the form of a cow. Her garment is long and she wears a collar with an outermost row of drop pendants. Harpocrates is naked: a conventional indication that he is a child. Another invariable indication of his youthfulness and that he was heir to the throne of his father Osiris would be a sidelock. In this instance, a ring at the right of his head suggests the missing sidelock was of precious metal attached separately. He also wears a collar, a double heart amulet on a string and a uraeus on his brow as sign of his royal status. This was a votive statue donated to a temple or shrine: the donors name is inscribed around the base asking for life from the goddess.
