{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["EA58937"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring: consisting of a thick circular hoop, supporting a square bezel with slightly rounded edges, inscribed with three lines of hieroglyphs. The content of the inscription is problematic, as the signs do not make any immediate sense, although this does not exclude the possibility that they conveyed some meaning in a very cryptic fashion. It has been suggested that the last line of signs may contain an unusual writing of the name Psamtek, perhaps commemorating a king of that name of the 26th Dynasty, but this is uncertain.
