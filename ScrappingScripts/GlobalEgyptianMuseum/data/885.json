{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.5850", "Dating": "PREDYNASTIC PERIOD (not before); EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD ?; EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "10.2 cm", "Width": "6.7 cm", "Depth": "3.7 cm", "Name": "Figurine of hunchback", "Description": "The wooden figurine, which was purchased during the public sale of the Amherst collection at London in 1921, consists only of a naked torso surmounted by a head with a pointed beard. The person represented has lost the upper limbs which were once held in place by the tenons at the chest. Of the lower limbs only a part of the right thigh has survived. The function of the quadrangular hole, hollowed out  in the abdominal region, is not clear: could it have served to fasten a kilt or to provide a place of attachment for the genitalia? The most characteristic detail is nevertheless the enormous protruding thorax and the dorsal hump due to a pronouced curvature of the vertebral column. The paleopathological exam of the symptoms prove that this person was struck in childhood by vertebral tuberculosis."}
