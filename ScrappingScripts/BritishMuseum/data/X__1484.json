The rider's head is, and the horse is considerably damaged: the head and most of the neck are gone, much of the surviving foreleg and rear leg are missing: the group has split away at its join with its left side, and only the right side remains. The rider wore a garment that reached almost to his knees, and appears to have had boots. Part of the harness survives, the rein over the horse\u2019s neck. From a two-piece mould, the two pieces would have been joined, one side since lost. Orange-brown Nile silt, with a grey-brown core.
