The largest single group of examples outside Egypt is in the British Museum, where there are in excess of thirty such statues, complete or broken. Most of them were recovered from the temple of Mut at Karnak, where many are still visible. But their original provenance was without doubt the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III on the West Bank at Thebes. Amenhotep's temple fell into decay around one hundred years after his death, and was used as a convenient quarry by many later pharaohs. Reliefs from the walls were reused in the nearby temple of Merenptah, and considerable numbers of the Sekhmet statues were moved to the Mut temple, and some kings added their names to the statues in their new locations. The association between Sekhmet and Mut is probably to be sought in the form of the lioness common to the iconography of both deities. In addition, most of the statues were positioned near the sacred lake in the temple. This lake has an unusual kidney shape, and there are other places in Egypt in which rituals to Sekhmet were carried out near similarly shaped lakes. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
