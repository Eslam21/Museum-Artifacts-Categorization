{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "1977.109.35", "Dating": "11TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "INCISED", "Height": "32.5 cm", "Width": "21 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "A round-topped limestone stela belonging to Sobekemhat, decorated on one side only with a single scene. The face of the stone is framed on three sides by an incised line border, painted yellow and black, the back has been left rough. The figure is carved in very shallow sunk relief, the inscription is incised. The scene shows the deceased standing on the left facing right towards three vertical columns of text. Sobekemhat wears the traditional short kilt and broad collar, his head is shaved in the manner of a priest. He appears to be holding an object in each of his hands but damage to the stone makes it difficult to define what they are. Two columns of the text run the full length of the stela while the third, by the torso of Sobekemhat, is much shorter."}
