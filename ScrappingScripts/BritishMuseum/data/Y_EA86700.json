{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86700"], "Description": [" Comparatively small seal-impression with a partly flat, partly convex rear, showing traces of a surface, maybe a leather or textile bag or similar, perpendicular to this a deep impression of a turned cord, similar to EA86689 and EA86690. The dark brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica and small charcoal bits. The clay was hardened after excavation. The front shows finger impressions as well as the impression of a scarab-like seal that is partly broken off at the left. The seal motif consists of a circumferential band, a standing figure on the left, facing to the right, towards a lying sphinx wearing a double crown and an uraeus as well as a beard. Behind the sphinx a cobra facing to the left holding its wings in front of it, between them a sun disc. Above and underneath it possible further illegible signs. Same seal used on EA86707.
