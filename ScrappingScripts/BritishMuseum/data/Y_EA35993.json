However, the shape and distribution of the foliage motifs owe much more to Egyptian styles of vase-painting, which go back to the early New Kingdom. While plentiful in the Theban necropolis, they were not known elsewhere, so this amphora may have been produced in Thebes. It has a time span from Dynasty 26 (664-525 BC) to the Ptolemaic period.
