He is seated with crossed legs on the pedestal, but with neither a roll of papyrus nor a pen. He is wearing a shoulder length striped wig and a short kilt with a broad belt. His face has a slim, oval shape. The lines of the nose and protruding cheekbones create a kind of a frame around the long, narrow eyes. The vizier has broad shoulders, a torso that curves toward a slim waist, and an unnatural breadth of hip."}
