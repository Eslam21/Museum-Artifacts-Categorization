{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "E92:613", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "FLASK", "Material": "POTTERY", "Width": "7.5 cm", "Name": "Pottery pilgrim flask", "Description": "Small pottery flask, the body moulded and stamped on each side with an indistinct scene of a standing male figure and rosettes, the handles applied. The form of the flask is attested in Egypt already in the early New Kingdom, and faience examples are common in the 26th Dynasty. During the Christian Period pottery water-flasks were mass-produced in particular for pilgrims visiting sacred places such as the shrine of Saint Menas, a third century martyr buried in the desert west of Alexandria. This flask may derive from the shrine of the saint, who may be depicted in one or both of the figures."}
