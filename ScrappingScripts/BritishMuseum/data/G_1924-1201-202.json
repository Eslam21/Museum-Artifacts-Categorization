Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Group of Worshippers. According to her, a worshipper is depicted on the exterior. The main vase of this group is the St. Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos 1991, no. 964). Most of the vases in this group display a mixture of techniques consisting female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black-figure. Lemos identifies the sherd as coming from a chalice, but the shape is distinctly that of a mug.
