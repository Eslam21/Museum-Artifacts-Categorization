This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Similar compositions are found on scarabs of the beginning of the New Kingdom (for example Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 209, no. 93). A comparable treatment of the back and legs is found on other scarabs from Naukratis that can be dated to the Second Intermediate Period: BM 1888,0601.65; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.4 and H5115.8. A dating between the Hyksos and the early 18th dynasty seems probable. The collection of Bristol holds a series of early scarabs from Naukratis, often said to come from the Scarab Factory, and which were not illustrated in earlier publications. Petrie illustrated several other early examples of scarabs and scaraboids. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
