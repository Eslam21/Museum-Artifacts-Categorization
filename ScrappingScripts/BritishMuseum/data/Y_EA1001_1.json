On the base of the 'slipper' is a figure of Isis, standing with arms uplifted, between two vertical columns of inscription. The lower section has figures of Thoth, Anubis and the Sons of Horus carved on each side. On the right side, a portion from the head-end is preserved, giving part of the feet of the figure of a god (Thoth) and of two vertical columns of inscription. Continuations of text from the lide also appear here. Almost all of the left side is preserved, and provides the continuation of text from the lid, which precedes to the figure of Thoth at the foot. There are three vertical columns of text which precede a figure of Anubis, a further three columns preceding Qebhsenuef, and two columns of inscription preceding a figure of Thoth on this side. The end of the coffin has a large 'djed' column carved into its lower section. The coffin has been reassembled from the fourteen fragments (excluding the one acquired in 1965) into which it was broken. The lid is almost complete, but considerable portions of the lower section are missing.
