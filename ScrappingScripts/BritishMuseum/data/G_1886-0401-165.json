These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup Type A2 or B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are few at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (p. 712, no. 704) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.135) (Phase 3) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Named in inscription: Apollo"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1886,0401.165"]}
