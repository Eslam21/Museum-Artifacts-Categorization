{"artifact_name": "spacer-bead; amulet", "Object Type": [" spacer-bead ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA30486"], "Description": [" Gold foil recumbent sphinx: the head of the uraeus is broken off and there are signs of repair on the right shoulder. The whole of each side including the pedestal was made in one piece with a punch in a shaped mould - the join is visible down the centre of the nose and the middle of the back. The back of the pedestal on which the sphinx sits is rounded. A base-plate, slightly turned up at the edges, was added to the bottom. Under the chin of the sphinx is a cylindrical tube, slightly corrugated, representing the beard; this in turn rests on another tube, set at right-angles, providing the passage for the stringing and protecting the figure itself from being rubbed by the thread or wire, as did a collar of gold wire at the back of the sphinx where the thread or wire emerged. The sphinx has a human head and lion's bodies. On its heads it wears the 'nemes' headdress with a uraeus made from wire curving across the top of the head in four loops. The sphinx's tails ismade from wire and arranged around the right haunch; it is thickened into a knob at the end. Signs of solder under the uraeus and joining the tail to the body are visible.
