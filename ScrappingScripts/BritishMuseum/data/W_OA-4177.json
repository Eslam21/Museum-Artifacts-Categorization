", " The whole range of al-Q\u0101sim's recorded fals weights is represented in the British Museum's collection with the exception of types of 15 kharr\u016bba and 33 q\u012br\u0101\u1e6d, both known from unique pieces and with crude script (Miles 1948, 31; 1958, 48). Of the remaining types, the dated issues of 119, 121 and 122 fill much of the latter part of his term of office and the 24- kharr\u016bba and great-fals or fals-al-kab\u012br weights, on which no executive appears, belong earlier. The semicircular ornament of the 24- kharr\u016bba weight may also support an early dating since it is similar to the ornament found on al-Q\u0101sim's first issue of qis\u1e6d-system stamps and an anonymous counterstamp associated with his first issue of heavy weights (see OA+ 4292, OA+ 4293, OA+ 4025, OA+ OA+4032, OA+ 4033, OA+ 4103 and 1895,1220.7). Al-Q\u0101sim is the first Muslim official in Egypt whose name is found on the copper coinage (e.g. Walker, p. 294). Bibliography: Miles, G.C. 1948. \u2018Early Arabic Weights and Stamps\u2019.
