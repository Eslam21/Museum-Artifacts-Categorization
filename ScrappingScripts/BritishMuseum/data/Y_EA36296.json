{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA36296"], "Description": [" Fragmentary head of a limestone male statue. The figure wears a striated wig tucked behind the oversized ears. The edges of the wig are now damaged, but at full length they likely reached to his shoulders. His eyes are narrow with faintly modelled eyebrows, and the surviving outline of the nose shows that it was broad in shape. The corners of the mouth appear slightly upturned suggesting a faint smile, while the rest of the lips, chin, and nose are now defaced. The face is fleshy in appearance, with further damage to the cheeks and around the brow. The object is now attached to a modern rectangular base.
