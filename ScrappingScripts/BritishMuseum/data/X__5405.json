", " This piece is now lost. Brief description ('scarab') with sketch from Chautauqua distribution list of the Egypt Exploration Fund. It is possible to identify the scarab with Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 36. The publication states that it is a paste scarab, not a stone one. The \"Scarab Factory\" in Naukratis produced variants of the name of Amun-Ra on scarabs and scaraboids made out of glazed composition (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 25 and 36; on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). If the identification is correct, this scarab belongs to a type which was distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Greece and Punic sites (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI, subtype 16-22, see especially 22 for this piece; a type which is well-related to her larger type XXVIII B).
