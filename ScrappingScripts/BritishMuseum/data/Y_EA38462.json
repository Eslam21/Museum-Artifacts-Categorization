{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA38462"], "Description": [" Light-brown pottery pilgrim-flask with circular body, double-neck and two handles, the mouth of each neck is damaged. On each side, within a border of large sunken points, Saint Menas stands to front, his arms outstretched in blessing. Above each arm is a quincunx of sunken points, perhaps representing a cross. He has curly hair, wears a short tunic with long sleeves, and a long cloak, and is flanked by camels. Both sides are from moulds produced from the same archetype, but one of the moulds was more worn than the other.
