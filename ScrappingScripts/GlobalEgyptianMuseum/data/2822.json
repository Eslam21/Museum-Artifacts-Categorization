{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:158", "Dating": "MODERN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "2.5 cm", "Width": "3.8 cm", "Name": "Modern scarab with the name of king Tuthmosis III", "Description": "Large glazed steatite scarab, with a fragment from a mummy bandage fastened to the back. Many modern imitations are covered in shreds of cloth, sometimes ancient, to lend an air of authenticity. The underside of the scarab bears a text in garbled hieroglyphs including the throne-name of Tuthmosis III. The forms of the incised signs and the combinations are typical of modern imitations. This example is important, as the date of acquisition indicates a relatively early modern date, in the 1840s."}
