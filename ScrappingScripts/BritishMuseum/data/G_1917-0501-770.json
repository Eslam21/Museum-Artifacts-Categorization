{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["1917,0501.770"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring. A single, long piece of gold wire has been coiled around thirteen times to form the bezel of this ring, one end of which was formed into a simple snake's head. The other end has been coiled around three times to form the tail. The scales of the snake have been summarily rendered with a few hatched lines and dots formed by a punch. Below the snake's head a cabochon garnet has been soldered into an oval setting made of sheet gold, around which gold wire has been shaped to emulate the forms of rearing snakes.
