{"artifact_name": "figure; plaque", "Object Type": [" figure ", " plaque "], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.113"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta naked female figure plaque. A thick plaque with a rounded top, the front showing the naked figure of a woman in high relief. Her arms are by her sides and her breasts are prominent. She has a short but full hairstyle or wig, brushed back all round, with a narrow fillet above the forehead. She probably stood on a projection from the lowest part of the plaque, now lost. The edges and the back of the plaque are square and smooth. Pressed into a one-piece mould, the edges were cut to shape. Traces of white coating in naval and red paint on the pubic area. Brown Nile silt with a thick grey-brown core, abundant fine mica and white inclusions. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period ", " Ptolemaic (early, ?)
