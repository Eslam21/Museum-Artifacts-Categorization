However, the curvature of the shoulder is consistent with his Type 9.B. For parallels regarding the shape and decoration, see See Berlin 3678 from Rhodes (Samos 6.1, pl.42 no. 346). The inscription is unusual as these typically appear on the lip not the wall if they are placed on the inside of the vessel.
