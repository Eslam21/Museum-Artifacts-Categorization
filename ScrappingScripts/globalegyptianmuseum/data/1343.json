{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7611", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; WRITTEN WITH A REED PEN/REED WITH SPLIT NIB", "Height": "12.2 cm", "Width": "4.6 cm", "Depth": "3.6 cm", "Name": "Figurine of bewitchment", "Description": "This figurine in clay is part of a large number of identical objects that Jean Capart purchased in Cairo in 1938. They probably come from the necropolis of Saqqara, like a share of figurines preserved at the Museum of Cairo. The pieces represent, in a very schematic manner, a person kneeling, the arms tied behind the back. They must have served in the performance of bewitchment rituals in order to render the enemies of Egypt and of the king harmless. This example is entirely filled with written texts in black ink and noted in a very cursive hieratic text, difficult to dicipher."}
