{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5768", "Dating": "RAMESSES II/USERMAATRE-SETEPENRE", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "DIORITE", "Technique": "STONE-TECHNIQUE", "Height": "154 cm", "Width": "58 cm", "Depth": "52 cm", "Name": "Naophorous statue of Kha-em-wese", "Description": "This damaged naophorous statue of a high priest of Memphis was never finished. The front part of the statue, with the knees and part of the legs, has broken off where the naos begins. Also missing are the arms, the right shoulder and the head with the upper part of the back pillar. Traces of the first phase of polishing can be seen on the soles of the feet. The inscription reveals that this statue depicts the priest of Ptah and king's son Kha-em-wese and that it was dedicated by his son Ramesses. Perhaps this statue was erected unfinished, as it is the inscription, which really makes it complete."}
