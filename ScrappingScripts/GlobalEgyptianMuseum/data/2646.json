{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1920:273", "Dating": "2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "ENGRAVED; CARVED", "Height": "34 cm", "Width": "26 cm", "Name": "Stela of Ankhefeni", "Description": "The hieroglyphic formula for offerings names the singer Ankhefeni as the deceased and Nakhtiankh as 'his brother who causes his name to live at the terrace of Osiris'. The line of hieroglyphs at the centre of the image names a third man, the local temple accountant Iy, who presumably supervised the cutting of the stela. The scene shows Nakhtiankh burning incense in an arm-shaped censer before Ankhefeni, a rare motif on non-royal monuments of the period. The relatively crude cutting is typical of Upper Egyptian stelae of the latest phase of the Middle Kingdom and the 2nd Intermediate Period, and reflects the loss of training and control by the royal workshops at a time of increasing political disunity."}
