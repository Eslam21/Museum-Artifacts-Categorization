{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA460"], "Description": [" Limestone seated male statue of Mahu, part of a pair composition with his wife Duat now broken into two pieces. Mahu sits on the left side of the high-backed chair. He wears a double wig with an undersection of tight curls that reaches to the shoulders. Black paint has been applied to the wig. His eyes are almond shaped with a thick upper eyelid and an incised line above indicating the eyelid crease. The arched eyebrows are indicated with faded black paint, and his nose is long and broad at the nostrils. There is slight damage to the tip of his nose. His lips are thick and fleshy, and slightly uneven in shape. The lips are pursed together, and both sharply incised along the edges. His face is fleshy and rounded at the nose, mouth, and jawline. Red-brown paint has been applied to the face and body to indicate his skin. He wears a tunic with long ridged sleeves, decorated with faded white paint. On top of the upper body he wears a broad collar with visible rows of beaded detail with traces of red and yellow paint. His arms are placed across his lap. His long kilt appears belted at the waist and extends to the lower legs with a pleated front panel. A single column of text is inscribed along the centre. A horizontal line of inscription is featured around the statue base, beginning at the front and moving to the left side of the seat. Seven columns of text are inscribed on the left side of the seat, and on the reverse a further six columns are inscribed behind Mahu. There are traces of blue paint in some of the hieroglyph signs, and red paint within the incised borders. There are several chips across the edges of the chair and front of the statue base, resulting in damage to some of the inscription. The figure of Mahu has suffered damage to the nose but is otherwise in good condition.

The figure of Mahu\u2019s wife, Duat, arrived at the Museum two years before her husband\u2019s statue (EA 460: https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA460_1). The surviving inscription across the monument features various dedications to Theban deities, and their professions also suggest a link to the Theban area. Mahu is given the title \u2018overseer of the work of Amun at Karnak\u2019, while Duat is described as the \u2018priestess of Amun-Re and Hathor\u2019, thus it has been inferred that the statues originally came from Thebes. Such statues would have typically been established either in tomb or temple contexts, where the statue was likely intended to receive offerings for the afterlife. Further Bibliography: J. Assmann, M.
