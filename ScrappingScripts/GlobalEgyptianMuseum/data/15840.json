The Amduat describes the journey of the sun god through the 12 hours of the night. Nespaqashuty was the \"Overseer of the Treasury of the House of the God's Worshiper of Amun.\" He is shown on the right, presenting offerings to the god Osiris, \"the Lord of Eternity, the Foremost of the beautiful West.\" Following this scene, three registers, or sections, show the 12th hour in the underworld when the sun god, in the middle register, is travelling on his solar boat. The boat and its crew are about to go through the body of a huge snake through its tail. The text describes how, \"all these beings enter the snake's tail old, frail, and weakened by age and emerge from its mouth as newborns.\""}
