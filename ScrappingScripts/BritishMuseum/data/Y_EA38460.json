{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA38460"], "Description": [" Grey-brown pottery pilgrim-flask with circular body, short neck and two handles, the fabric is very worn. On side (a), within a plain border, Saint Menas stands to front, his arms outstretched in blessing. Above each arm is a cross. The mould-pressed impression of the saint is featureless, but he wears a short tunic; no cloak is visible. He is flanked by camels. On side (b), within a wreath-border, is a cross, surrounded by an inscription in relief, probably, but it cannot be read due to a covering of concretion.
