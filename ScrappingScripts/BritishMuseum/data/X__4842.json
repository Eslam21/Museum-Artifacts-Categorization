", " This scarab is published as coming from Naukratis (Budge 1893, no.186). Most signs are legible, but reading is difficult: the hieroglyphs are possibly only used here for their intrinsic magical value, as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). Although this specific motif is not listed by Gorton, it could pertain to her type XXXIV A (Gorton 1996, 121-123). The style and technique applied to the motif, as well as the general shape and treatment of the scarab fit well with this type.
