{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["1926,0415.12"], "Description": [" Forepart of head of a gypsum statue; resembling Caesar. A plaster portrait head, probably of Julius Caesar, with the hair brushed forward around the ears, and receding considerably above the forehead. The brow is furrowed, the nose is damaged, and ridges run from the nose, round the mouth, to the chin. The pupils of the eyes are marked, the gaze upwards. A small area of drapery shows on the left side of the neck. The rear of the head is hollow behind the face, and casting webs run across the top of the head and down each side. A cleaned-up casting web runs down the centre line of the face: what survives of this object was made in a multipiece mould. White plaster. The hollow at the back is now filled with modern plaster used to mount the object on its stand.
