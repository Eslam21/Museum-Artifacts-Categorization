{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7358", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "6.9 cm", "Width": "5.1 cm", "Depth": "4.2 cm", "Name": "Serpent", "Description": "This object in bronze depicts an upright cobra, also called  uraeus. The animal symbolises the goddess of Lower Egypt Wadjet, assimilated with the burning eye of the sun. It is for this reason that the uraeus ornaments the brow of pharaoh and that is is often crowned with a solar disk. It served also as the protector of precious objects, like the chapels and naos of temples. It is very probable that this example once decorated a royal head and that the eyes and the different parts of the erect body were inlaid."}
