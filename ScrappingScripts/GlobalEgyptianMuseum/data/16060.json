To the left, a small Eros, god of love, lifts Leda's thigh to help in the union. Zeus, as the swan, stands in front of Leda, his swan mouth kissing her. This depiction is similar to another piece in the Coptic museum, but this part is missing now. Leda is depicted nude with a strong body and her facial features are influenced by the style of early Byzantine art."}
