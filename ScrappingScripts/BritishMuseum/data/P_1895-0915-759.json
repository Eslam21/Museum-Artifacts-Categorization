Popham attributed this to Vanni in 1940 (his note in interleaved copy of the Malcolm catalogue). As Peter Anselm Riedl pointed out on a visit to the BM in 1963, it is a study for Vanni's altarpiece dated 1609 executed for the Oratory of St Antony Abbot in Siena and now in the chapel of S. Antonio in the Cimitero della Misericordia. There is a oil sketch for the painting in the Louvre (2014; Viatte 1988, no. 541) and Riedl also records related drawings in the Biblioteca Comunale, Siena (E.I. 14/79v) and another in a private collection. A full list of related drawing is given by Ciampolini. The upper part of this design also features in a painting in the Villa Torrigiani at Capannori near Lucca (Ciampolini 2010, p. 920), on which see 1895,0915.586. Another preparatory drawing for the S. Antonio picture, still closer to the Lucca painting, is now in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid. Lit.: J.C.
