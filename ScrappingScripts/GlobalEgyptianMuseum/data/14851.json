The queen's facial features follow the stylistic canons of the reign of Amenhotep the Third in the almond-shaped eyes, the arching eyebrows, and the thin nose. The down-turned mouth with fleshy lips is a typical detail of the portrait of the queen, making her image unique and unmistakable. The queen wears a wig of tight curls leaving her ears uncovered. Two winged cobras protecting her name flank the diadem of the head. The head was found in the temple of Hathor, protective goddess of the turquoise mountain at Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai"}
