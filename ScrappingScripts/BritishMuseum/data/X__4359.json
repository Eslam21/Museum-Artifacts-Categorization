", " Naukratis provided various scarabs and scaraboids, in glazed composition, Egyptian blue and steatite with a similar inscription (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 83-85; Gorton 1996, 102-103, type XXVIII B, esp. no. 24). Depending on the identification of the bird, a goose or a duck, its translation can be either a cryptographic reading of the name of Amun-Ra, the goose being a sacred animal to him, or the motto 'Shu, son of Ra' (for both readings: Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). Drioton translated this trigram by Amun (Drioton 1957, 17, no. 5). Although the registration list of Boston states that this stone scarab was discovered in the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming), it is uncertain that it was produced locally. On the other hand, variants of this type, found in many examples and made out of glazed composition or Egyptian blue, were definitely produced there (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 83-88). The precise and naturallistic style in which the hieroglyphs are engraved is comparable with other scarabs bearing the same inscription. One was tentatively dated to the 25th dynasty (scarab in glazed composition: Magnarini 2004, 317, 10.55). Another was found in Cerveteri in Etruria dated to the second half of the 7th century BC (scarab in steatite: H\u00f6lbl 1979, 34, pl. 74/1, no. 109. For the latter, H\u00f6lbl mentions a parallel from the tomb 268 in Monte Abatone, near Cerveteri, that belongs to the first half of the 6th century BC.
