This obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis, in Egypt, in 1300 B.C. It was one of the first to be brought to Rome, in the time of Augustus, and stood in the Circus Maximus. Sixtus V decided to put it in front of Santa Maria del Popolo, which had temporarily taken the place of the basilica of St. Sebastian as one of the seven churches of the Jubilee. It was to be the first obelisk seen by pilgrims arriving in Rome from the North along the Via Flaminia and was to be the focal point of the three streets fanning out from Piazza del Popolo: Via del Babuino, Via del Corso and Via Ripetta."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["monument"], "Associated places": [" Associated with: Rome "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Charles Francis Arnold Howard, 5th Earl of Wicklow"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Hugh Howard"], "Acquisition date": ["1874"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1874,0808.597"]}
