{"artifact_name": "tomb-relief", "Object Type": ["tomb-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA994"], "Description": [" Part of a limestone tomb-relief: parts of three registers carved in good, low relief are preserved. In the bottom register, on the right, is a scene of fishing with a drag-net from a boat; on the left are parts of a harvesting scene - three men are shown harvesting grain and two donkeys are being led away, their backs loaded with great sacks of grain. The centre register contains a scene in which young girls dance and boys play various games; one of the boys is shown wearing an unusual mask. The top register, of which only the lower half is preserved, originally contained a scene of boat-building; on the left, part of one boat is visible; the remainder of the register shows a number of workmen engaged in preparing timber for further construction. The block is in two pieces, the division running down the middle; some damage has occurred on each side of this cut. Some colour still remains: considerable traces of red on the bodies of the men, traces of yellow on the grain being harvested, a few spots of blue on the water below the boat in the bottom register.

The importance of agricultural themes and cyclical iconography in Old Kingdom tombs, however, led other Egyptologists to suggest that the relief portrays events in a seasonal harvest festival intended to ensure the renewed fertility of the land once the crops had been gathered. The female figures were dancers or singers who belonged to a train of musical performers found at most important Egyptian ceremonies. The central group depicts boys dancing around a harvest deity (perhaps shown as a statue) who guaranteed fecundity once reaping was done. The scene of the boy struggling to escape the hut may be part of a puberty ritual marking his transition to a state when he, like the fertile land, could create new life. Bibliography. B. Porter & R.
