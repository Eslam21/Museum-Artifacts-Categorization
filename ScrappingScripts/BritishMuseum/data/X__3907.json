", " This stela is called the \u2018Damanhur stela\u2019, but originated probably from the North Eastern part of the Great Temenos of Naukratis: \"A copy of the hieroglyphic version of the Rosetta stone was found at Naukratis in 1884 and taken to Bulaq; a Greek version must of course have existed there also. We heard in the winter of 1884 that a large inscribed stone had been found in the north-east part of the great Temenos, and taken away\" (Gardner 1888, 83). Copy of the hieroglyphic text of the Rosetta stone. Yoyotte suggested that, because of the direction the text is written in, there must have been a symmetric stela to the left side, possibly the stela Cairo Museum TR 2/3/25/7 unprovenanced (Yoyotte 1993/94, 690-692). The latter presents similar dimensions, material, crude execution and bad writing as well as a similar composition of the top scene. The only difference is that it represents the holy triad of Naukratis (Amun, Mut and Khonsu). Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis. Part II (Sixth Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund), London.
