{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1936,0903.3"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of a devotee of Isis. A devotee of Isis standing on a curve-fronted plinth with several mouldings. She is clad, probably in an Isis-mantle (the knot is hidden by garlands crossing diagonally from her left shoulder to her waist); the mantle reaches to her ankles and her feet are bare; drapery also falls on her right side. A row of curls crosses her brow and Isis-locks fall in front below her shoulders. She wears a narrow wreath above her brow and a larger one above it, on the front of which is a disc and horns: a break at the top has removed the feathers of her headdress. Her right arm is bent at the elbow, the hand raised to hold what might be a sistrum but seems more likely to be a cobra (as held by Isis-Thermuthis). Her lowered left hand holds a situla with a knobbed base. The back is plain with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, the front covered with a white dressing, much worn: scientific analysis shows it to be gypsum (BM Department of Scientific Research Report 7048, 10 May 1999).
