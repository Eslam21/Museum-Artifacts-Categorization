In the upper section is a winged sun-disk with two uraei and two recumbent jackals holding sceptres. In the middle register the deceased stood on the right before an altar heaped with offerings. Behind it stand Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, an effaced deity (Tefnut?), and Anubis. Six lines of text in the third register contain a prayer on behalf of the sistrum-player of Amun-Ra Ast(em)khbit, apparently daughter of P?-d?-'lmn-nb-nswt-t?wy and  a sistrum-player of Amun-Ra whose name is lost. On the back is painted a rising sun between standards, one of the West on the right and the other lost. Space has been left for two pedestals, now lost, at the bottom of the stela. The right side of the stela, which was made from a separate plank of wood joined by dowels, is now lost. The surviving part of the stela is badly damaged along the top and sides. The surface is cracked and effaced in places. There is a red border around the stela and a multi-coloured border of blue, red, blue, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes along presumably three sides and between the registers. The background of the stela is yellow. At the top is a curved blue sky. The disk is red with yellow uraei which have blue heads and red disks. The wings are blue with a yellow patch with red dots. The area between the uraei is white with red dots. The jackals are black with red sashes and faded blue flags. The text here is black as it is elsewhere. At the top of the middle register beneath the border is a frieze of green, blue, and red ovals on a white background and a blue sky. Only the edge of the white dress of the deceased is visible. The altar is blue and the offerings blue and red. The deities had red bodies and hands, green aprons, blue wigs, black sceptres, and black-striped yellow collars for the first four. Ra has a yellow face and red disk, while that of Atum is green with a red and white crown. Khepri and Shu have red faces and black head-dresses. The fifth deity has a red disk, while Anubis has a dark (green or black) face. There is a blue curve at the end of the register. The border between the middle and lower register lacks the separating black stripes between the rectangles. The text in the lower register is black on alternating white and yellow backgrounds between alternating red and blue dividing lines. The sides were plastered. The scene on the back is red on a white painted background.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}},{"processed":{"preview":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/preview_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":288}]}},"small":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/small_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":288}]}},"large":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/large_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1300},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":833}]}},"max":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/max_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":2500},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1602}]}},"mid":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/mid_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1000},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":641}]}},"huge":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/huge_00246200_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1600},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1025}]}},"zoom":{"resizable":true,"format":"pyramid tiff","modified":1174641258854,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/f7e1328c_9fa8_422b_b43e_a3ba01238ed8/00246200_001.ptif","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":3047},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1952}]}}},"sequence":1,"@link":{"type":"reference"},"view":"Full: Front","use":{"date":[{"date":1412377200000,"availability":true,"earliest":2014,"latest":2014}],"warning":false,"collection":true,"free":true},"legal":{"credit_line":"© The Trustees of the British Museum"},"admin":{"uid":"odin-246200001","id":"246200001","source":"odin","uuid":"d812d43b-d2f9-35d9-a615-c8f8d35ee3e4"},"description":[{"value":"Sycomore fig wood stela(paint on plaster) divided into three registers: 1 - Winged sun-disc with uraei and jackals below. 2 - Scene depicting Astemakhbit adoring Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnet(?) and Anubis. 3 - Prayer in six lines of Hieroglyphic text on alternating cream and yellow rows.

In the middle register a male figure stands on the right with arms raised in worship before an altar on which rests an offering cooled by a lotus-bud. Above him his name is given as Astsy(?) with the title 'nb pr'. On the other side of the altar stand Ra-Horakhty, Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, and Anubis. The lower register consists of three lines of text with a prayer to Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, and Anubis. The stela is cracked twice down its height where the three planks which compose it adjoin. The surface is worn in places. There is a patch in the back to fill a hole in one of the planks. The background of the stela is yellow. There is a red border along three sides of the stela beside which is a thin blue border. Further in is a multi-coloured border consisting of blue, green, blue, and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes. A similar border separates each register. The disk at the top is red. The wings have a red upper edge and are in three sections: blue, yellow with red stripes, and blue with white tips. The uraei are blue with light green crowns and enclose an area of white with red dotted rays. The jackals are black with red sashes and blue sceptres. The text is black here and in the next register where it is written between black lines, apart from the last column which is set off by green lines. The deceased has a red body, yellow kilt with blue lines and a red fringe, black belt, blue cap, green cone, and black flower. The altar is blue with a green offering and blue lotus. The deities have red bodies, yellow black-striped collars, blue aprons, green hands, apart from Anubis, holding red cloths, and blue wigs. Horakhty has a yellow face with black features and a red disk with black uraeus. Osiris has a blue face, black beard and uraeus, and green crown and streamer. Horus has a similar face to Horakhty with a green and red crown. Isis and Nephthys have green faces and green and red and green, blue, and red crowns respectively. Anubis has a black face and black hands. The text in the third register is black on alternate white and yellow backgrounds between blue lines. The sides are painted half red towards the front and half white towards the back, apart from the bottom edge on which there are only traces of white. The back was painted white, most of which has faded. The fronts of the pedestals are yellow with a blue grid and bottom red edge. The outer sides are half red towards the front and half white towards the back. The inner sides and bottoms appear to have been entirely white of which only traces remain. The 'ba'-bird has a blue wig and beard, yellow face and front with black details, and red wings and legs.

sides.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

In the upper portion there appears a winged sun-disk with two uraei and two 'wedjat'-eyes. The first and second registers are divided by a 'kheker'-frieze. There is a sky-sign decorated with stars at the top of the second register below which is a scene. The deceased stands on the right in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind it stand Ra-Horakhty and Isis, whose outstretched wings enclose an 'wedjat'-eye above a basket-sign. On the third section are four lines of text consisting of a prayer to Osiris on behalf of Pabakmeher, son of P?-d?-?nm. The rest of the text is damaged. The stela is badly worn especially along the edges with loss to some of the original design and the last line of text. The surface is cracked and flaked in places. The top and sides of the stela and the three sections of the stela are bordered by a band of blue, red, green, and yellow rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in green. The background of the stela is now buff. The disk is red with white upper wings with blue dots and a green upper edge, blue-feathered middle wings, and green-feathered lower wings with red edges in the middle. The uraei are yellow with blue heads and one white and one red crown. The eyes are blue with black pupils on white and a red band between eye and eyebrow. The hieroglyphs are black. The 'kheker'-frieze is blue with red ties on a white background. The sky-sign is blue with black stars. The human figure is red with black features and a white kilt with black folds. The altar is blue, the pot yellow-brown, and the lotus green where not faded. Ra-Horakhty has a red disk with black uraeus, white face with black features, blue wig, yellow collar, green body, red hands, and green sceptres. Isis has a green face and body, blue head-dress and wig with red fillet, and red dress with black hatching. Her right outer wing is divided into four sections: white with black dots, blue, green, and blue with feathers indicated in black and edged in red. The left inner wing is faded badly but appears to have had an area of green with black dots and a central red patch on the upper left side, red with black lines on the lower left, and blue black-edged feathers on the right tip. The 'wedjat'-eye is blue with a black pupil and a red band between eye and eyebrow. The basket-sign appears to have been green. The hieroglyphs are black between blue dividing lines in  both the  middle  and lower registers.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications equipment","summary_title_combined":"_communications_equipment|communications equipment","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6113","checksum":2704100869,"id":"x6113","uuid":"ad6300a0-b8a7-3569-9e5e-a3c3d2d21727"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"stela","summary_title_combined":"_stela|stela","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}}],[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"architecture","summary_title_combined":"_architecture|architecture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x5214","checksum":532947864,"id":"x5214","uuid":"d2f1d9fe-54f5-3ad7-b5ee-3e1095128c3f"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"monument","summary_title_combined":"_monument|monument","admin":{"uid":"mip-x7948","checksum":622761761,"id":"x7948","uuid":"08ec80f3-1713-381a-9312-2a0e2efcf78f"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"stela","summary_title_combined":"_stela|stela","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}}]],"sort":"stela","type":"object name","value":"stela"}],"xtemplate":{"brief":"{\"Object Type\":{\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">stela</span>\",\"id\":\"x9321\"},\"Museum number\":\"EA35467\",\"Cultures/periods\":{\"id\":\"x13554\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">26th Dynasty</span>\"},\"Findspot\":[{\"id\":\"x30299\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Excavated/Findspot:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Thebes (historic -

Nehemesbast: this round-topped stela has a curved sky-sign at the top. Beneath is a sun-disk with uraei, each with an 'ankh'-sign. The disk is flanked by  udjat-eyes and below is a 'kheper'-beetle. The god Ra-Horakhty stands on the left, while on the right the lady Nehemsibastet, daughter of the mry-n?r priest P?-d?-'lmn, raises her arms in worship.

The stela is cracked in places and some of the plaster has fallen away along the edges. The background of the stela is white with a blue sky-sign at the top. The disk is red with a white border edged in black. The uraei appear to have been browny yellow with blue heads and blue anfch-signs. The 'wedjat'-eyes are blue with a black pupil on white.

The garment of the god is browny yellow, faded in places, with a blue belt and ankh-sign. His bangles and collar were also browny yellow. His tail is blue and his 'was'-sceptre green.

Her dress is white with red stripes and tinged in browny yellow with blue edges to the sleeves and lower edge which also has black and red   tassels. Her collar is green. The altar was yellow-brown, now faded, with a blue top. The offerings are blue, black, or white with red-stemmed lotuses of green, white, and red. The pots under the altar are red with white and green tops resting on blue stands. Around them are entwined blue-stemmed lotuses. The figures rest on a red platform edged in blue which has diagonal stripes of varying shades of red and pink. The black hieroglyphs are between blue lines on a browny yellow background.

In the upper section is a winged sun-disk beneath which is a scarab beetle and a šn-sign. On either side of these an 'wedjat'-eye and a recumbent jackal are depicted. In the second is a 'kheker'-frieze. There is a scene in the third register below a sky-sign with stars. The deceased stands on the right with arms raised in worship before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind the altar Ra-Horakhty is enthroned. A winged Isis stands behind him enfolding a šn-sign, and behind her stand the four sons of Horus. In the fourth register four lines of text contain a prayer to Osiris on behalf of the lady Qeres, daughter of ??-n-rw? and the lady ?s-Mwt-prw. The stela is composed of three planks which have cracked apart and been rejoined in modern times. There are other cracks on the surface and along the edges. The background of the stela is white or buff-brown. There is a multi-coloured border around the stela and between sections composed of red, blue, orange, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes, all edged in green. The disk is red with white black-lined uraei. The upper edge of the wings is green and the wings are tripartite: white with blue dots, blue feathers on white with a patch of green all edged in red, and green feathers outlined in black with white tips and edged in red. The beetle is blue with black feet and a red disk. The sn-sign is green with a red centre. The eyes are blue with black pupils on white and red patches between eye and eyebrow. The jackals are black with green flags. The kheker-frieze is green with red ties. In the third register the sky is blue with black stars. The deceased has a green body, black wig, and white dress. The altar is blue, while the pot and lotus are green with a red edge on the latter.

Behind the altar stand Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Horus, Hathor, and Anubis all in mummiform guise. In the third register four lines of text contain a prayer to these deities on behalf of the chantress of Amun-Ra Nehemesratawy. The pedestals which supported this stela are now lost. The stela is cracked in two places down the face where the three planks which form it adjoin. The surface is slightly worn and the colours have faded in places. There is a red border around the stela and a multi-coloured border of blue, red, blue, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes between the registers. The background of the stela is yellow. The disk is red with a yellow rim. It has blue upper wings with an upper red edge, green middle feathers on yellow, and blue lower feathers on white with a patch on each side of red feathers on yellow. The uraei have blue-dotted lower bodies, while their upper bodies are blue, red, and green with black details. Their crowns are respectively yellow with green feathers on the left and red on the right. The decoration between the uraei is red, blue, and green. The jackals are black with red sashes, blue flags, and green and red sceptres. The 'šn'-signs are blue with red centres. The texts are black on a green background. In the middle register the deceased has a red body, white garment with a green fringe, green collar and cone with black details, and blue wig. The altar is blue, pot red and lotus green with red edge. The figures of Osiris, Isis, and Horus have red bodies, green arms and sceptres, and green-striped collars.

At the top is a winged sun-disk with uraei between which is a 'kheper'-beetle and a šn-sign. On either side of the uraei are 'wedjat'-eyes and recumbent jackals with flags. In the second register is a 'kheker'-frieze. At the top of the third section is a sky-sign below which is a scene. The deceased stands on the right with his arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooledby a lotus-flower. Behind the altar stand Ra-Horakhty, a winged Isis enfolding a šn-sign, and the four sons of Horus. The bottom register consists of four lines of text containing a prayer on behalf of the chamberlain of the God's Wife Pasherenese, son of the chamberlain of the God's Wife 'Imn-?r-d?.s and the lady ?st-?r-d?.s. The stela has split in two, presumably along the line of the two planks which were used to make it, and has been repaired in modern times. The background of the stela is white. The scenes are separated from each other by a multi-coloured border of grey, blue, red, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in green. The disk is red with green upper wing edges, blue-dotted white upper wings, blue feathers on white middle wings, edged in red, and green lower wings with feathers distinguished in black and two black dotted patches with red borders. The lower wing border is also red. The uraei are green with a red and green crown respectively. The beetle is blue with black feet and a red disk. The šn-sign is green with a red centre. The 'wedjat'-eyes are blue with a black pupil on white and a red patch between eye and eyebrow. The jackals are black with green flags. The 'kheker'-frieze is alternately green and blue with red ties. The sky-sign in the third register is blue with black dots. The deceased has a red-brown body, black wig, and white and green kilt. The text above him is black. The altar is blue with a black pot and green lotus edged in red. Ra-Horakhty has a white face with black features, white crown with green feathers edged in red, blue wig, grey collar, green body and sceptre, and red hands. Isis has a green body and face, blue wig and head-dress, and alternating areas of blue and green edged in red on her wings. The sign that she enfolds is green with a red centre. The sons of Horus have blue wigs, grey black-lined collars, green bodies and sceptres, and red hands. The faces of the first two are red with black features, the third black, and the last white with black features. The text in the fourth register is blue-black between blue and red dividing lines. The sides and back are plastered, although this has worn away along the edges.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications equipment","summary_title_combined":"_communications_equipment|communications equipment","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6113","checksum":2704100869,"id":"x6113","uuid":"ad6300a0-b8a7-3569-9e5e-a3c3d2d21727"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"stela","summary_title_combined":"_stela|stela","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}}],[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"architecture","summary_title_combined":"_architecture|architecture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x5214","checksum":532947864,"id":"x5214","uuid":"d2f1d9fe-54f5-3ad7-b5ee-3e1095128c3f"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"monument","summary_title_combined":"_monument|monument","admin":{"uid":"mip-x7948","checksum":622761761,"id":"x7948","uuid":"08ec80f3-1713-381a-9312-2a0e2efcf78f"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"stela","summary_title_combined":"_stela|stela","admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}}]],"sort":"stela","type":"object name","value":"stela"}],"xtemplate":{"brief":"{\"Object Type\":{\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">stela</span>\",\"id\":\"x9321\"},\"Museum number\":\"EA8459\",\"Cultures/periods\":{\"id\":\"x13554\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">26th Dynasty</span>\"},\"Findspot\":[{\"id\":\"x30299\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Excavated/Findspot:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Thebes (historic -

In the second register the deceased stands on the right in adoration of the solar barque in which appear a scarab beetle, Thoth, Isis, Nephthys, Iuf enthroned under a curved serpent, three other gods and a hawk-headed helmsman. In the third register the deceased stands on the right in worship before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus. Behind stand Ra-Horakhty, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, and two other gods. In the fourth register the deceased on the right adores Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Horus, Hathor, and Anubis. The four lines of text at the bottom of the stela are largely illegible. The stela is well preserved apart from some gouges and cracks on the surface although the text in the fifth register has nearly completely faded away. The background of the stela is white with a red border along the sides. There is also a multi-coloured border of red, grey and occasionally blue rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes along three sides of the stela and between each register. The sun-disk is red with a yellow outer rim and black-edged white upper wings, red-striped middle wings, and grey lower wings with black tips. The uraei are grey and white with red and grey decoration between them. The jackals are black with red and black sceptres and red and grey flags and red sashes. The other three scenes are all depicted beneath a grey-blue sky. The human figure has a red body, white cap, and white kilt with black stripes. The gods usually have red bodies, grey faces, dark grey or blue wigs, and grey garments with white and black markings. In the second register Iuf has a white face with black features as do Ra-Horakhty in the third and Horus in the fourth, the first two having red disks on their heads. The three gods behind Iuf have red faces and upper bodies, while the face of Thoth is black as is that of Anubis in the fourth register. In the third register the last god has a red body and grey face. Osiris in the fourth register is completely red apart from white feathers and sceptres. The goddesses have red dresses, grey bodies, and dark grey wigs. In the second register the solar barque, its uraeus canopy, and the beetle are grey, while the throne of Iuf is white and red. In the third and fourth registers the  altars  are  white,  the pots  red  and white,  or completely white, the flowers red. The hieroglyphs are black.

large round-topped stela is divided into four registers. In the upper register is a winged sun-disk with two uraei which enclose a design of 'ankh'-signs and 'was'-sceptres. The uraei are named as Wadjet and Nekhbet and are faced on either side by a recumbent jackal of Anubis holding a sceptre. In the second register below a sky the barque of the sun god Iuf is depicted. The ram-headed Iuf stands in a serpent-kiosk in the centre of the craft. On the prow are the gods Hu and Sia, while on the stern stand Hetet and the helmsman whose appellation is damaged. On either side of the boat four baboons and a 'ba'-bird stand with arms raised in adoration. In the third register below a sky Padiamunnebnesuttawy stands on the right clad in a leopard-skin, with his arms raised in worship before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. On the other side of the altar stand the divinities Ra-Horakhty, Atum, Khepri, Osiris, Ms, Nephthys, and Anubis holding two cloths. The fourth section of the stela consists of six lines of text containing a prayer to these deities on behalf of the ?t-n?r priest, prophet of Amun in Karnak, great seer of southern Heliopolis, keeper of secrets, w?b-priest in the holy places, prophet, chief of temple of Khons-in-Thebes Neferhotep, Pediamennebnesttawy, son of the like Hor and the lady of the house '?rwt'. On the back of the stela is depicted a sun-disk with rays between the standard of the East on the left and the standard of the West on the right. The stela stands on two small pedestals consisting of four steps.    The stela is cracked vertically in two places presumably along the edges of the three planks of wood with which it has been fashioned. There is a large gouge at the top of the stela where a 'ba'-bird had been attached at the time of its discovery according to a drawing made at that time. In several places the paint is worn away to the underlying plaster or the original wood. There are four borders along three sides of the stela being painted red, buff-white, multi-coloured (made up of blue and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes), and white. The background of the stela varies from buff-white to white. The registers are separated by multi-coloured borders. In the upper register the disk was originally gilded with a red border. The upper wings are blue, the middle white edged in black with blue tips, and the lower green edged in black with a red lower edge. The uraei have blue faces and lower bodies with red and green patches in the middle and a black-lined centre. Wadjet has a red crown and Nekhbet a green one. The 'ankhs' are blue and the 'was'-sceptres green. The jackals are black with red sashes and flags and sceptres with brown bases and green black-edged tops. The hieroglyphs are black. The second register has a blue sky-sign at the top. The barque has a green centre and blue edges on a blue sea. The rudder and oar pole are red and the paddle is green. The snake canopy is blue with a green crown. The gods have red bodies, blue wigs, and green kilts edged in black apart from luf whose face is green and disk red. The baboons have red faces, arms, feet, and rumps, blue heads, and green bodies with black flecks. The 'ba'-birds have red faces, arms and legs, blue wigs and upper wings, white collars, and green upper legs and head-buds. They stand on blue standards with green black-edged feathers. The jars beneath are blue. The fan on the left is blue, white, and red with a blue handle. The hieroglyphs are black between black lines. The sky at the top of the third register is blue. The human figure has a red body,","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

The wings of Isis are coloured the same as the winged disk. Her dress is red, her wig and head-dress apparently blue, and her face and body now black. The eye is blue with a black pupil on white and a red band between eye and eyebrow. The four sons of Horus have black bodies, pink collars, and blue wigs. The face of Imsety is red with a black beard, that of Hapy is red, of Duamutef black, and of Qebhsenuef white with black features. The text at the bottom is black between blue dividing lines.

A winged sun-disk with two uraei appears at the top of the stela. Below is a line of text with a prayer to Osiris. The deceased stands on the right of the scene in the third register. His arms are raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. On the other side of the altar stand Osiris, a winged Isis enfolding an 'wedjat'-eye, and the four sons of Horus. At the bottom four lines of text contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Atum on behalf of Irethorru, son of P? (?)-h?.... The four sections of the stela are separated by multi-coloured borders. The stela is not in a good state of preservation. The surface is cracked and worn and the surviving colour has faded. The original background appears to have been white. The registers are divided by multi-coloured borders of blue and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes edged in black. The disk is red with blackened upper wings having pink patches with black dots and blue lower wings edged in red. The uraei have red bodies, blue heads, and a red and white crown respectively. The hieroglyphs in the upper register are red, blue, and black. The line of text in the second register is black. The deceased has a red body, blue wig, and now black collar and kilt, possibly originally dark green. The altar is blue with a blue red-topped pot. The lotus has a blackened stem and leaves, red base, and blue and white flower.  Ra-Horakhty has a white face with black features, a white crown with blackened feathers edged in red, blue wig, pink collar, red hands, and blackened body and sceptre. The wings of Isis are coloured the same as the winged disk. Her dress is red, her wig and head-dress apparently blue, and her face and body now black. The eye is blue with a black pupil on white and a red band between eye and eyebrow. The four sons of Horus have black bodies, pink collars, and blue wigs. The face of Imsety is red with a black beard, that of Hapy is red, of Duamutef black, and of Qebhsenuef white with black features. The text at the bottom is black between blue dividing lines.

The stela is cracked in several places and the painted surface has flaked away or faded in parts. The general background of the stela is white. The disk of the god is red with a white border and brown uraeus. His face is browny white with a black beak and eye with blue adjuncts. The wig was blue, now faded, and the collar green. The crook is brown and yellow and the flail is yellow with white ends with blue and red dots. The hands of the god are green, his upper body red, and his lower body yellow. The throne is blue and red divided by white on a blue and green mat with white black-lined ties, which rests on a pink base with red and brown dots. The human figure is red or pink when covered by his otherwise white  garment which has black-marked pleats. His features and wig are black, his fillet and cone red, and the flowers on his head green with red ends. The vase is brown with blue water. The altar is green with a brown top. The lotuses have red and blue stems, brown bases, green leaves, and blue flowers. There is a green lettuce in a white pot under the altar. The base line is light blue. The hieroglyphs are black on a buff background between blue lines. The disk at the top is red with a white border and brown uraei. The upper wings are white with blue dots and a blue upper edge; the middle are white with blue lines; while the lower are green with feathers indicated in black and red upper and lower middle edges.

The body of the lady is yellow, outlined in red, while her dress is outlined in red and blue on the white background of the stela. Her wig is black, her eye black on white, and her collar red with blue dots. The disk of the god is red with a white border and yellow uraeus edged in red. His face is white with features in red and a black beak. His wig is blue, collar grey with red lines, and sceptres grey and blue edged in red. His upper body is red with blue dots, while the lower is white edged in red. The throne is blue and red divided by white edged in red. The altar is blue and white with a grey pot outlined in red and a red-stemmed lotus with a grey flower. The figures rest on a green and blue base with white red-lined ties. The hieroglyphs are black on a grey background, while the sky-sign is blue.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

It would appear that he originally wore the Blue Crown, and the one shown now is the result of a misguided restoration of the last century. Before the king stands the royal scribe and royal butler Hori, son of Pt?-m-w??, and the lady ?wt-?r, holding a feathered fan. Between Hori and the king the remains of an altar can be seen. The lower register is separated from the upper by a blank horizontal strip and consists of thirteen vertical columns of text enumerating the goods given by Hori on behalf of the king to the necropolis-foreman 'ln-?r(t)-??w. On the left of the scene there is the figure of a man possibly in an attitude of worship. This stela has been badly damaged and heavily restored along the edges. The royal crown and most of the body of the figure in the lower register are not original. The first seven columns of text in the lower register are badly worn in parts.

Behind it sit the deities Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, and Thoth. In the third register the deceased stands on the right with arms raised in adoration before an altar piled with offerings, and topped by a lotus-flower. Behind it stand Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Thoth, Anubis, and Wepwawet. Four lines of text in the fourth register carry a prayer to Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, Anubis, and Wepwawet on behalf of the  sistrum-player of Amun-Ra Taheb, daughter of the God's Father priest P?-d?-'lmn-nb-nswt-t?wy and T?-d?-nfr-?tp. The lower corners of the stela are left unpainted for pedestals which are now wanting. On the back beneath a canopy appears the sun in the horizon with its rays flanked on the left by the standard of the East and on the right by the standard of the West. The stela is split down the centre where the two planks of wood of which it is composed adjoin. The surface is worn and cracked in places and some of the colours have faded. The stela is bordered on all sides by a red strip. On three sides there are borders of white, blue, white, multi-coloured rectangles consisting of blue, red, blue, and green separated by one black and two white stripes, and white. The background of the stela is yellow. The upper register has a red and white border at the top. The disk is red while the uraei have white tails with black dots, blue upper bodies, and crowns of red and yellow with black outlines respectively. The wings are tripartite: the upper feathers are indicated in black on a white background with red dots in the centre and blue tips; the middle have red feathers on a white background bordered by white lines; while the lower feathers are green with black outlines and tips. The jackals are black with red sashes and red and blue flags and sceptres. The text is black between blue dividing lines. The first and second register are separated by five borders which are white, multicoloured composed of blue, red, blue and green squares separated by white squares, white, multi-coloured consisting of blue, red, blue, and green ovals on a white background, and white.

The general background of the stela is white. The sky border is blue. The 'wedjat'-eyes are blue with black pupils on white and a buff band between eye and eyebrow. The signs between are green with a red centre for the upper 'shen' and black for the water-signs. There is a multi-coloured border of green, blue, brown, and red rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in blue. The disk of the god is red with a brown uraeus edged in black. The face is white with a black beak, black eye on brown with blue adjuncts and wig. The collar, tabs to the upper garment, bangles, and kilt are buff. The upper garment is green with a blue belt. The body of the god is red, his sceptre green, and ankh-siga and tail blue. The throne is blue and green divided by buff (originally white ?), on a green mat. The human figure is red or pink when veiled by his robe, which is otherwise white with black lines. The features and wig are black, cone red and white, and flower green with a red stem. The vase is blue with a white centre. The altar is blue and buff with a green top. The offerings are blue, green, red or white, once with black dots, while the flowers are red-stemmed green-leaved, and blue. There are two green plants in white pots beneath the altar, together with a red pot with a black top and blue-stemmed green flower entwined around it and a red and blue vase. The altar and figures rest on a black base. The hieroglyphs are black on the white background between blue dividing lines. The sceptres at the sides are green.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

The stela has been damaged along the edges with loss of much plaster especially in the last line of text. A small square of wood has been cut from the middle of the left edge. There are several cracks on the back of the stela, but, as the plaster largely remains on the back and sides, the cracks visible on the back need not indicate separate planks and may only be cuts in the surface of the one piece of wood.

top of this round-topped stela appears a curved sky-sign below which is a winged sun-disk enclosing seven columns of text. In the central area of the stela the lady of the house Hotepamun stands on the right in adoration of a rearing serpent, Ra-Horakhty, and Osiris. This scene is bordered by the standard of the West (on the left) and that of the East (on the right). Below are two lines of text with a prayer on behalf of Hotepamun, daughter of the prophet of Montu, M?pw and N?rs. The stela is well preserved apart from a vertical crack near the left side where the two pieces of wood, which make up the stela, abut. This has been repaired apparently in modern times. There are also several gouges on the surface. The background of the stela is white. The hieroglyphs at the top and bottom are black on a yellow background with white black-edged dividing lines. The sky-sign was blue, now faded. The sun-disk is red with a white border and yellow uraei with white heads. The upper wings are yellow with a white upper edge; the middle are now white with black lines, but there are slight traces of blue on them; while the lower are green delineated in black and edged in red. The body of the lady is green with black features, black wig, red fillet, green and red cone, yellow bangles and yellow dress with a white fringe and black stripes. The serpent is green with black features. Ra-Horakhty has a red disk with yellow uraeus, green face with black beak, black eye on yellow, white wig, yellow shoulder, white and black collar, red body, yellow bangles, and green hands and sceptre. Osiris has a yellow crown with white red-edged feathers, yellow uraeus, green face with black features, white beard, yellow shoulder backed in red, black and white collar, red body, yellow bangles, and green hands and sceptre.

In the upper register, below a curved sky-sign, is a winged sun-disk with uraei beneath which is an 'wedjat'-eye. In the middle register the deceased stands on the right in an attitude of worship with the goddess of the West and Anubis behind him. In front of him is an altar on which rests a lotus. On the other side of the altar stand Ra and the four sons of Horus. The names of the last two are inverted. In the third register are five lines of text with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty on behalf of Irtyru, son of Iw?n?. The stela has suffered loss from gouges on the surface. The stela is also cracked in places. It has been darkened, making the text difficult to read. Some of the text has been partially restored from a copy made byBirch during last century. The original background appears to have been buff. The sky-sign was blue. The disk is red with blue upper wings, having pink patches and edged in red, and green lower wings edged in red. The 'wedjat'-eye appears to have been blue, now blackened, with a black pupil on white and a red patch between eye and eyebrow. The hieroglyphs are green, red, and blue. On each side of the eye and each side of the middle register are multi-coloured borders composed of blue, red, green, and orange-pink rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in green. The sky-sign in the second register is blue.  The deceased has a red body, green garment and cone with a red  tip. The goddess has a green  body, orange-pink dress, black wig, and red, blue (?), and green head-dress. Anubis has a green body, orange collar striped in black, blue, now faded black, wig and carries a green feather and blue and red streamers. The altar was blue and the lotus blue and green. Ra has a red body, orange collar with black stripes, blue, now faded, black wig, white face with  black  features, orange-pink disk, and green hands and sceptres. Imsety has a green body, orange-pink collar with black stripes, blue, now faded black, wig, red face, green and red cone, and blue hand holding a green feather with blue and red streamers. Hapy has a red body, orange-pink collar with black stripes, red face, blue wig, green and red cone, and blue hand with green and blue streamers. Duamutef, wrongly named Qebhsenuef, has a green body, orange-pink collar with black stripes, green face, and blue wig and hand holding blue and red streamers.

On the other side of the altar stand Ra and the four sons of Horus. The names of the last two are inverted. In the third register are five lines of text with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty on behalf of Irtyru, son of Iw?n?. The stela has suffered loss from gouges on the surface. The stela is also cracked in places. It has been darkened, making the text difficult to read. Some of the text has been partially restored from a copy made byBirch during last century. The original background appears to have been buff. The sky-sign was blue. The disk is red with blue upper wings, having pink patches and edged in red, and green lower wings edged in red. The 'wedjat'-eye appears to have been blue, now blackened, with a black pupil on white and a red patch between eye and eyebrow. The hieroglyphs are green, red, and blue. On each side of the eye and each side of the middle register are multi-coloured borders composed of blue, red, green, and orange-pink rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all edged in green. The sky-sign in the second register is blue.  The deceased has a red body, green garment and cone with a red  tip.

In the third register there is a sky-sign beneath which the deceased stands on the right with arms raised in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind it stand Osiris, Isis whose wings enfold an 'wedjat'-eye, Nephthys, and the four sons of Horus on a lotus-blossom. The fourth register contains five lines of text consisting of a prayer to Osiris on behalf of Pasheri(en)bastet, son of K?-?r-r? (?) and the lady Šps. The stela is cracked in two down the centre where the two planks of wood from which it is made adjoin. There is some loss along the crack and the edges of the stela and some wear elsewhere on the surface. There is a multi-coloured border of red, bright green, pink, and blue rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes, all edged in green along the edges of the stela and between the registers. The background of the stela is now buff-grey. The sky-signs in the first and third registers are blue. The disk is red with blue-dotted pink upper wings edged in blue at the top and green lower wings with some white tips all edged in red at the bottom. The uraei are pink with blue dots and a blue head and red and white crown on the one that is still extant. The hieroglyphs are red, blue, and green. The text in the second section is black. The  human  figure  in  the  third  register  has   a red-brown body, bright green collar and kilt which has a blue patch, blue wig, and green cone. The altar is blue; the pot red-brown with a black top; and the lotus has green leaves and stem and red flowers. Osiris has a green face with black features, green body and sceptre, white collar, red hands, and white crown with blue feathers edged in red. The eye is blue with a black pupil on white and a red band between eye and eyebrow. Isis has a green body, red dress, and blue wig and head-dress. Her upper wings are bright green with a blue-dotted pink patch, while her lower wings are blue edged in red. Nephthys has a green body, red dress and streamers, blue wig, and green and red head-dress. The four sons of Horus have green bodies, pink collars with black stripes, and blue wigs. The face of Imsety is red with a black beard, that of Hapy apparently red, and that of the last two green. The stem and leaves of the blossom are green with a pink base. The flowers are red and blue.

In the upper register is a winged sun-disk with uraei and a recumbent jackal on each side. In the second register the deceased Wahibra stands on the right before an altar piled with offerings in adoration of the solar barque. At the prow of the boat is a 'kheper'-beetle followed by Thoth, Maat, Isis (?), Iuf under a serpent canopy, Hu, Sia, Wehemy, and the helmsman. In the third register Wahibra stands offering incense over an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. The objects of his devotion on the left of the altar are Osiris, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Thoth, Anubis, Wepwawet, and the four sons of Horus. Six lines of text in the fourth register contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty, Atum, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Anubis, Wepwawet, and Hathor on behalf of the keeper of secrets of the Osiris Buchis Wahibra. The names of his parents are left blank. The pedestals on which the stela originally stood are wanting. A hole at the top probably served to attach a 'ba'-bird which is now also lost. The stela is well preserved apart from some fading of colours and a few gouges. The border along three sides of the stela is composed of three rows of red, blue, green, blue rectangles separated by a curved white stripe. The general background of the stela is sandy white. The disk at the top is red with blue upper wings, red-striped middle wings, and black outlined lower wings with black tips on the background and a red lower edge. The uraei have blue upper bodies with white and red crowns respectively. They enclose an area of light blue with hieroglyphs in dark blue and a frieze of blue and red ovals. The jackals are black with red sashes, blue flags, and blue and red sceptres. The text above them is black. Between the first and second registers is a border of blue, red, blue, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes, a frieze of blue, red, and green ovals on a blue background, and a blue sky stripe, each one being separated from the other by white bands. The deceased has a red body, white kilt, and blue cap with white cone and blue flower. The altar is green with a brown top, blue offerings, and red-stemmed flowers having blue buds or a white flower with a red edge. The solar bark is green at the ends and blue in the centre with an upper white strip. The flower at the prow has blue outer leaves and a red centre and the disks on both sides are red. The beetle is blue. The gods have red bodies, red faces apart from a black Thoth, a green Iuf, and a white helmsman with black details, blue wigs, and green kilts with black details. The goddesses have green bodies, red dresses, and blue wigs. The head-dresses of Thoth and Maat are outlined in black on the background; the disks of the next two are red; while the helmsman has a white and red crown. The helmsman holds a red rudder with a blue top. The pole to which it is attached is also blue but is surmounted by a red disk. The bark rides on a green sea with a black centre line. The borders between the second and third registers are similar to those mentioned above except that the upper one is composed of blue, white, red, blue, and green squares. The deceased has a red body, white garment, and blue cap. The altar is red with a blue top, green pot, and red-stemmed blue flower with a red edge. Osiris has a red body, green face, feathers on crown, and hanging garment, blue sceptres, and white crown and collar. He sits on a blue and red throne.

False Door: The upper panel of the false door contains a representation of Washka and his wife Djefatsen seated on either side of an offering-table. The texts above and on each side of this panel contain Washkai's titles and two short ?tp-d?-nsw formulas. Beneath the panel are representations of various food- and drink-offerings. The ?tp-d?-nsw formulas on the sides of the panel are continued down the outside columns of the false door proper and are terminated by small standing figures of Washka. The inner columns of the false door bear figures of the deceased and his relations. On the left, from top to bottom: Washka with a small boy, his eldest son, ?nw, bringing two pieces of cloth, his son, Mry-?t.f with a jug, a woman, Rnpt-nfrt with a lotus flower, and another woman, Snt-m-n?wt. On the right, from top to bottom: his wife, Djefatsen, with their son (?) ?d-smnh, his eldest son [sic], ?m-r‘, carrying a haunch, his son Sn?m-?, carrying a duck, the woman Pp?, carrying a duck, and the woman ?nft. The whole is carved in indifferent, sunk relief. The surface has suffered much flaking through the action of salt. No colour remains.    Offering-table: the upper half of the surface of the offering-table is occupied by representations in low relief of an offering-table with offerings placed upon it and of a small ewer standing in a depression, flanked by two depressions for liquids; the lower half of the table has formal funerary scenes carved in fair, sunk relief. On the right, figures of Washka and his wife Djefatsen are shown seated behind an offering-table; they are accompanied by their names and a short ?tp-d?-nsw formula. In the centre are piled food- and drink-offerings and on the left the kneeling figures of five men, all sons (but not so named), presenting offerings to their deceased father and mother: his eldest son Khenu, his eldest son [sic] Hemra, Senedjemib, Meryitef, and Kedsemenkh. The surface is a little affected by flaking.

stela is divided into four registers. At the top there is a winged sun-disk with two uraei. Below it is a 'kheker'-frieze. In the middle register below a sky-sign are two scenes divided by a column of text in the centre. On the left Herast worships Ra-Horakhty, who stands behind an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. On the right she worships Atum (?). There are five lines of text in the third section containing a prayer on behalf of the lady Herast, daughter of the general of the barque of Amun-Ra (?) S??-?st-g?wt, and the lady 'Irty-rw. The stela is not very well preserved. The thin layer of plaster has worn away in many places and the surviving surface is cracked. The pegs to attach the missing right side are partially in place. The colours have darkened in certain areas. A multi-coloured border of blue, red, green, and yellow rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes originally encircled the stela and divided the registers. The background of the upper and third register is blue. The disk was apparently yellow-gold with a black border, while the wings are yellow-white with red details. The uraei and hieroglyphs are white with red and black details. The 'kheker'-frieze was green with red ties, but is now much blackened. The background is white. In the third register the sky is blue. The objects and figures are yellow-white with red details and some black features on the faces of the figures. The hieroglyphs are black on white background with red edges. The hieroglyphs in the fourth register were green with red edges, but are now blackened considerably. They are on a white background between blue lines. The back of the stela is plastered in white.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

four sections to this round-topped stela. At the top is a winged sun-disk with uraei and recumbent jackals on each side. In the second register the deceased stands in adoration on the right before Harpocrates on a  pedestal   and the solar barque in which appear Ra-Horakhty, Isis, Nephthys, Iuf, and Horus holding the rudder. The boat and pedestal rest on a stretch of water. The third register is divided into two scenes beneath a sky-sign.  On the left the deceased Nehemesratawy stands in worship before an altar covered with offerings behind which stand Osiris and Nephthys. On the right in a similar scene the deceased worships Osiris and Isis. Six lines of text in the last register contain a prayer to Ra-Harakhty, Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, and Anubis on behalf of Nehemesratawy, whose beautiful name is Mrt-'lmn-?t[s], daughter of the prophet of [Amun] in Karnak... and the lady... The stela is in poor condition. It has split down the centre along the join of the two planks which compose it, and the right side has warped. The surface is damaged by wear and gouges with much loss to text and design. The stela appears to have been bordered on three sides by a multi-coloured selection of rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes, but only traces of red, blue, and white rectangles remain. The background of the stela is sandy white. The sun-disk is red with blue upper wings having a red upper edge, white black-striped middle wings with red tips, and blue lower wings with red tips. The uraei are outlined in black and enclose red rays and blue decoration. The jackals are black as is the text here and throughout the stela. In the second register there is a blue sky at the top. The human figure is outlined in black with a light brown body and black wig. Her name is written above her in four columns. The first three are on a blue, red and blue background between blue and red dividing lines. Harpocrates is outlined in black on a green-topped blue and red pedestal. The boat is dark green with a red rudder resting on blue water with black waves. The hawk-headed deities have red bodies, blue wigs, green and white kilts, and white faces with black features. Isis and Nephthys have sandy-white bodies, blue wigs, and green and red dresses respectively. Iuf has a dark green body, green and white kilt, blue wig, and other details in black. His serpent canopy is dark green. The sky in the third register is blue and the central vertical column is written on a blue background with blue borders. The female figure is again outlined in black on the sandy white background with black wig and apparently light brown feet and arms. On the left the altar is light brown with a dark green top. There are a black-topped red vase on a black stand and a green floral offering under the altar, and red offerings and blue green-stemmed lotus-flowers and buds on top. The altar and offerings on the right appear to have been similar except that the altar and top are sandy white. Osiris has a red body, light brown black-striped collar, green hands, face and sceptre, black beard, and sandy-white crown with dark green feathers on the left, and sandy-white and red crown on the right. The goddesses have sandy white bodies, green dresses, blue wigs, and blue head-dresses where visible. The columns of text here are on alternating blue and sandy white backgrounds between blue and red dividing lines.  The text in the fourth register is black on alternating sandy white, pink, sandy white, and then blue backgrounds with a black upper line and then alternating blue and red dividing lines.

The stela is faded in places and damaged around the edges. The background is white. The figure of the lady is outlined in black with black eye and eyebrow. The cone on her head is red and white; the lotus has a green and red stem, green leaves and red flowers. She has a black wig with a red fillet, brown, blue, and green collars, and a dress outlined in black with black stripes, blue edges, and pink dots on the upper part. The vase is yellow-brown and the water blue. The altar is blue with a brown top, blue pot, and green lotuses with green or red stems and blue flowers. The vase is red with a black top and stand and a green-stemmed lotus which has a green top showing a hint of red. The disk of the god is red with a brown uraeus.

The background is grey-white. The disk is blue, while the uraei have red tails and blue upper bodies. The wings are outlined in black in three sections, the upper having black dots and the lower green lines. The hieroglyphs here are red and blue. In the middle register Osiris has a red face, shoulders, and arms, blue body, white crown with blue feathers, and black beard. The altar is red, pot blue, and lotus blue with a red base. The four sons of Horus have blue wigs, white collars, and red, green, red and blue bodies respectively. The faces are white outlined in black except for Imsety whose face is red. The eye of Duamutef is black, of Hapy red, and of Qebhsenuef blue, while Imsety has a black beard and feather.

There is a multi-coloured border of red, blue, red, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes edged in black around the stela and between the registers. The background is grey-white. The disk is blue, while the uraei have red tails and blue upper bodies. The wings are outlined in black in three sections, the upper having black dots and the lower green lines. The hieroglyphs here are red and blue. In the middle register Osiris has a red face, shoulders, and arms, blue body, white crown with blue feathers, and black beard. The altar is red, pot blue, and lotus blue with a red base.

Behind the altar stand Osiris, Isis whose wings enclose an 'wedjat'-eye, a standing serpent, Nephthys, and the four sons of Horus on a lotus-blossom. The final section contains three lines of text with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Atum on behalf of Neskashuty,  son of ???? and Mwt?.

The lintel, jambs and the central area are carved with representations in sunk relief and incised texts. The lintel bears the figure of a winged disk, while the jambs carry invocations to Ra-Horakhty and Ptah on behalf of the workman Pennub. In the doorway Ptah is depicted sitting on a throne before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-blossom. Five columns of text containing a prayer to Ptah by Pennub are incised on the rear of the stela. The stela is in a good state of preservation apart from slight damage to the rear right edge. The hieroglyphs largely preserve their original colour of black, and the dividing lines between the columns are red.

Horakhbit: there is only one scene on this round-topped stela. At the top there are a curved sky-sign and a winged sun-disk with uraei. On the right stands the prophet of Amun, Horakhbit, son of the prophet of Amun and secretary of the Lord of the Two Lands ?r, clad in a long robe and a leopard-skin, in an act of adoration. Before him is an altar heaped with offerings. On the left sits the god Ra-Horakhty, mummiform. Between them are eight columns of text consisting of a funerary invocation of Ra-Horakhty, Atum, and Ptah-Sokar-Osiris on behalf of the deceased. On the sides are the standards of East and West. The stela is cracked in several places and slightly discoloured at the top left and the bottom right. The paint has faded in some areas. The general background is white with a blue sky-sign at the top. The disk is red with a white border and uraei outlined in black.

- a pyramidion containing two registers and below it a round-topped stela consisting of three registers and a short text of four horizontal lines. All figures are in sunk relief and all texts are incised. In the upper register of the pyramidion is the sun-disk in the solar barque, being worshipped on either side by a baboon whose arms are raised in adoration. In the lower register the overseer of prophets, Mernedjem, is shown kneeling in worship before Anubis in two parallel scenes separated by a vertical band of text. Between the pyramidion and the main stela there is an 'wedjat'-eye on the left, and there was presumably a similar on the right now lost. In the first register of the main stela, on the right the overseer of prophets and overseer of craftsmen Mernedjem, son of Hnm-ms, is offering incense and pouring a libation before an altar heaped with food offerings. On the left of the altar sit Osiris, Isis, Nephthys and Horus residing in Buhen. The second register depicts on the right his (Mernedjem's) son, the first prophet, divine scribe and mayor, Hrw-nfr, pouring a libation over an altar of food offerings. Behind him stands his second son, the second prophet ?r-m-hb with arms raised. He is followed by three male adults with two children whose names are not inscribed in the five columns above them. On the left of the altar is a file of five women and four children (?), some of whom carry sistra. They are named as the lady T-d?.s(?), her daughter T?-n... (?), and her daughter Mr?t-nbw. The remainder of the names appear not to have been inscribed. In the third register an altar covered with food offerings lies in the centre. On its right stands his father, the overseer of gold-workers, Khnummose, his wife, the lady of the house, S??t?, her daughter T?-?r-?r, her daughter N?-?b-?? and a fourth woman whose name has not been inscribed. Six vertical lines of text on the left contain a prayer to Osiris, Anubis, Isis and Nephthys. The text at the bottom of the stela consists of a prayer on behalf of Mernedjem and names his sons, the first prophet of Horus, lord of Buhen, Herunufer and the second prophet Horemheb. The stela has been broken into several pieces in antiquity with much loss and restored in modern times. The surface is worn and pitted in several places. There are no traces of colour.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x9321","id":"x9321","uuid":"c52e381a-6c4d-3ab4-8381-815bc0805a98"}},"value_combined":"_stela|stela","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"communications

Behind him are Anubis, Shu, Atum, and Ra-Horakhty. Below are four lines of text with a prayer on behalf of Nespamedu, son of Ns-Pt? and 'I(w)-b(w)-r?.s. On the back of the stela is a line of text in early demotic which names Iuburekhes. Presumably the rest of the inscription has been effaced. The stela is cracked down the centre where two planks of wood which make up the stela adjoin. There is a lesser crack down the right side of the stela and the surface is worn in several places. There is a multi-coloured border of red, green, red, and blue rectangles separated by three black and two white stripes around the stela and between the registers. The background of the two upper registers is buff. The sun-disk is blue with green uraei. The tripartite wings are composed of green dots on buff for the upper, red for the middle, and green lines on buff for the lower. The hieroglyphs are green, red, and blue. Osiris has a green body, buff collar, red face, blue wig, and green feathers all edged in black. The altar is red, the pot blue, and the flower green, blue, and red. The deceased has a red body, blue wig, green collar, buff upper dress, and green and buff skirt with red dividing line. Anubis has a blue body and wig, green ears, buff collar, and buff face outlined in black. Shu has a red disk, face, body, and hands, blue wig, and buff collar. Atum has a blue crown, red face, buff collar, and green body. Ra-Horakhty has a red disk and body, blue wig, and buff collar and face outlined in black. All four gods carry green sceptres. The hieroglyphs are red on white backgrounds between black lines. The hieroglyphs in the third register are black, or red or green edged in black on alternate white and buff backgrounds between red lines.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}},{"processed":{"preview":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/preview_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":313}]}},"small":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/small_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":313}]}},"large":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/large_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1300},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":904}]}},"max":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/max_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":2500},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1739}]}},"mid":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/mid_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1000},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":696}]}},"huge":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/huge_00246087_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1600},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1113}]}},"zoom":{"resizable":true,"format":"pyramid tiff","modified":1174579674300,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_10/4_17/658eab36_ef0a_47f3_8c51_a3ba01236dae/00246087_001.ptif","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":2999},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":2086}]}}},"sequence":1,"@link":{"type":"reference"},"view":"Full: Front","use":{"date":[{"date":1412377200000,"availability":true,"earliest":2014,"latest":2014}],"warning":false,"collection":true,"free":true},"legal":{"credit_line":"© The Trustees of the British Museum"},"admin":{"uid":"odin-246087001","id":"246087001","source":"odin","uuid":"eebe707f-8797-337d-bfca-9897e263f768"},"description":[{"value":"Sycomore fig wood stela(paint on plaster) divided into three registers: 1 - Winged sun-disc with uraei; scarab and symmetrical Hieroglyphs below. 2 - Scene depicting Osiris standing before an altar behind which stand Nespamedu(the deceased), Anubis, Shu, Atum and Ra-Horakhty. 3 - Prayer in four lines of Hieroglyphic text on alternating white and cream rows.

Behind him are Anubis, Shu, Atum, and Ra-Horakhty. Below are four lines of text with a prayer on behalf of Nespamedu, son of Ns-Pt? and 'I(w)-b(w)-r?.s. On the back of the stela is a line of text in early demotic which names Iuburekhes. Presumably the rest of the inscription has been effaced. The stela is cracked down the centre where two planks of wood which make up the stela adjoin. There is a lesser crack down the right side of the stela and the surface is worn in several places. There is a multi-coloured border of red, green, red, and blue rectangles separated by three black and two white stripes around the stela and between the registers. The background of the two upper registers is buff. The sun-disk is blue with green uraei. The tripartite wings are composed of green dots on buff for the upper, red for the middle, and green lines on buff for the lower. The hieroglyphs are green, red, and blue. Osiris has a green body, buff collar, red face, blue wig, and green feathers all edged in black. The altar is red, the pot blue, and the flower green, blue, and red.

At the top under a curved sky-sign appears a winged sun-disk with winged uraei enclosing a scarab beetle. On each side is a recumbent jackal holding a sceptre. In the second register Neswy kneels on the right in adoration of the solar barque. A 'ba'-bird on the prow of the bark worships Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, and Geb who are seated and behind whom stands the helmsman. In the third  register the deceased on the right stands in worship before an altar on which rests an offering cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind stand Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, Hathor, Anubis, and Wepwawet. The fourth register consists of five lines with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Khepri and names the deceased, Neswy, born of the lady T?-kwr-hb. The stela rests on two stepped pedestals and there is a 'ba'-bird on its top. The stela is cracked down one side where a separate plank which helped to form this stela had broken away and been rejoined in modern times. The surface is cracked in several places and the colours are faded. The background of the stela is grey-white. The sky at the top is blue. The disk is red with a white rim. The tripartite wings are blue, yellow with black details, and green with black details, with yellow patches and a red upper and lower rim, and white between the divisions. The uraei have blue upper bodies, red and blue-striped wings, and blue-striped bodies on grey-white with red and blue-feathered green crowns respectively. They enclose on one side a blue beetle below which is blue and red decoration and on the other side blue šn-signs with red centres. The jackals are black with red sashes, blue flags, and blue and red sceptres. The texts are black between blue lines where indicated. There is a border consisting of blue, red, blue, green rectangles separated by one black and two white lines and edged on both sides by white borders between the first and second register. The deceased has a red body, black features, blue wig with green top, and blue-striped grey-white garment apart from the area under his arm which is striped black. The barque is blue at both ends and green in the middle with red and grey-white stripes between these divisions and red disks and lotus-centres at the top of the prow and stern. The 'ba'-bird has a red body and legs, blue back and wig, and green underbody and cone. His fan is blue with red diagonal lines on grey-white and his flag red and his feather blue. The seated gods have red bodies, blue-striped collars, blue wigs, and blue-black ankh-signs. Ra has a grey-white face with black details, a blue sceptre, and a red disk with black horns. Atum has a blue face and a red and grey-white crown. The next four deities have green faces. Khepri and Shu have blue head-dresses; Tefnut's is red, while that of Geb is red and blue. The deities rest on a platform made up of blue, grey-white, and red rectangles. The helmsman has a red body, blue collar and wig, and green and grey-white kilt. The boat rests on blue water. The texts here and in the following register are black with blue dividing lines. In the third register the deceased has a red body, blue wig and eyebrow, green cone, blue-green collar and underarm garment, and white garment with black details and a blue belt.

At the top under a curved sky-sign appears a winged sun-disk with winged uraei enclosing a scarab beetle. On each side is a recumbent jackal holding a sceptre. In the second register Neswy kneels on the right in adoration of the solar barque. A 'ba'-bird on the prow of the bark worships Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, and Geb who are seated and behind whom stands the helmsman. In the third  register the deceased on the right stands in worship before an altar on which rests an offering cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind stand Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, Hathor, Anubis, and Wepwawet. The fourth register consists of five lines with a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Khepri and names the deceased, Neswy, born of the lady T?-kwr-hb. The stela rests on two stepped pedestals and there is a 'ba'-bird on its top. The stela is cracked down one side where a separate plank which helped to form this stela had broken away and been rejoined in modern times. The surface is cracked in several places and the colours are faded. The background of the stela is grey-white. The sky at the top is blue. The disk is red with a white rim. The tripartite wings are blue, yellow with black details, and green with black details, with yellow patches and a red upper and lower rim, and white between the divisions. The uraei have blue upper bodies, red and blue-striped wings, and blue-striped bodies on grey-white with red and blue-feathered green crowns respectively. They enclose on one side a blue beetle below which is blue and red decoration and on the other side blue šn-signs with red centres. The jackals are black with red sashes, blue flags, and blue and red sceptres. The texts are black between blue lines where indicated. There is a border consisting of blue, red, blue, green rectangles separated by one black and two white lines and edged on both sides by white borders between the first and second register. The deceased has a red body, black features, blue wig with green top, and blue-striped grey-white garment apart from the area under his arm which is striped black. The barque is blue at both ends and green in the middle with red and grey-white stripes between these divisions and red disks and lotus-centres at the top of the prow and stern. The 'ba'-bird has a red body and legs, blue back and wig, and green underbody and cone. His fan is blue with red diagonal lines on grey-white and his flag red and his feather blue. The seated gods have red bodies, blue-striped collars, blue wigs, and blue-black ankh-signs. Ra has a grey-white face with black details, a blue sceptre, and a red disk with black horns. Atum has a blue face and a red and grey-white crown. The next four deities have green faces. Khepri and Shu have blue head-dresses; Tefnut's is red, while that of Geb is red and blue. The deities rest on a platform made up of blue, grey-white, and red rectangles. The helmsman has a red body, blue collar and wig, and green and grey-white kilt. The boat rests on blue water. The texts here and in the following register are black with blue dividing lines. In the third register the deceased has a red body, blue wig and eyebrow, green cone, blue-green collar and underarm garment, and white garment with black details and a blue belt. The altar is blue with a red pot and blue lotus, Osiris has a red body with blue sceptres and streamers, green face, blue collar, and grey-white crown with blue feathers, black horns, and a red centre dot.

The upper register contains a winged sun-disk with two uraei on each side of which is a recumbent jackal holding a sceptre. In the second register the deceased in the form of a 'ba'-bird worships Ra, Atum, Khepri, Shu, Tefnut, and Geb who are all seated in a barque. In the third section the owner stands in adoration on the right before an altar on the other side of which are Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Hornedjitef, and Hathor. The fourth register consists of four lines of text containing a prayer on behalf of the prophet of Amun in Karnak, šs b??t Pakherkhons, son of the prophet of Amun in Karnak P?-d?-'lmn-nb-nswt-t?wy, and the sistrum-player of Amun-ra N?m.s-R?-?wy. The stela is cracked down the centre and has suffered loss from flaking in places. The right side has been subject to more darkening than the left so that some features are not easily distinguished. The background of the stela was originally yellow-white with black hieroglyphs throughout. There was a blue, now black, border around three sides of the stela, while the registers were divided by a multi-coloured border of blue and red rectangles separated by one yellow and two white stripes all edged in black. The disk at the top is red with a yellow border. The upper wings are now blackened; the middle are white edged in red; while the lower are green edged in black with a red lower border. The uraei have blue heads and white bodies with blue, red, and green details and a black-lined centre. Their crowns are respectively white with green feathers and red and they hold black green-edged sceptres. The text between the uraei is red and green above blue, red, green bands, and decoration on the white background. The šn-signs beside the uraei are blue with a red on white centre. The jackals are black with blue flags, red sashes, and red-topped green sceptres. The black hieroglyphs are between blue lines. In the second register the centre of the bark is green with blue ends having some red details. It rests on a blue band as do the gods in the bark. An altar in the prow is blue with a red pot and green flower. Ra has a red disk, black uraeus, white face with black features, blue wig, and ankh-sign, black-lined collar, and red body. Atum has a green and red crown, originally red face now faded,  red and yellow banded collar, blue on the shoulder, and green body and 'ankh'-sign. Khepri and Tefnut have green faces, green and yellow banded collars, blue wigs and ankh-signs, and red bodies. Their head-dresses are black and red respectively. Shu and Geb have blue wigs and 'ankh'-signs, red faces with black beards, red and yellow banded collars, and green bodies. The feather atop Shu is green. The rudder in the stern of the barque is red. On the left the 'ba'-bird apparently has a blue wig, and upper body, red face and hands, green lower body and red legs. It stands over a sign of the West with a blue base and green feather. The colours of a fan on the extreme right cannot be distinguished except for a dark, blue or black, frame. In the third register the deceased has a blue, now black, cap, with a green flower, red body, and a white garment with black details and a green belt and sash. The altar was apparently blue with a red pot with blue centre and green flower. Osiris has a white crown with green feathers, green face and hands, white collar with black details, red body, blue or black sceptres, and green hangings. Isis, Nephthys, and Hathor have blue wigs, green bodies, and red dresses. The two first have blue and red head-dresses and carry blue 'ankh'-signs.

winged sun-disk and a 'kheker'-frieze the lady Tamit is depicted in adoration of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and the four sons of Horus, who stand behind an altar on which rests a large lotus-flower. Seven lines of text at the bottom of the stela contain a prayer to Osiris on behalf of Tamit, daughter of thescribe ??-n-?srt , and the lady Ns-Mwt. On the back of the stela are three lines in hieratic which name Tamit and her parents. The stela is cracked in several places but is otherwise well preserved. There is some fading of colour in places. The background of the upper scenes is buff. The disk is red with brown uraei. The wings are blue edged in black with red tips and buff patches at the top, although the blue has largely faded to light green. The hieroglyphs at the top are black, white, red, and blue. The rest of the stela and the frieze is surrounded by a multi-coloured border of blue, red, green, pink, and a few yellow rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes all once edged in blue. The kheker-frieze was blue with white ties on a red background. The deceased has a red body, white dress with black details, and a blue wig, now faded. The altar is blue and the lotus has a green stem and leaves, pink base, and red and white flowers. The face and arms of Osiris are green, his body red, his collar pink, his sceptre black, and his crown white with green feathers. Isis and Nephthys have white head-dresses, blue wigs, pink upper bodies, green-blue dresses, blue and red streamers, and yellow-green feet. Imsety has a blue wig, white cone on it, red face, black beard, brown collar, and green-blue body. Hapy has a red face and body, green collar, and blue wig with white cone. Duamutef has a black face, blue wig, brown collar, and green-blue body. Qebhsenuef has a white face with black details, blue wig, green collar, and red body.

stela is in the form of a double doorway. The area above the lintel and the right column of the exterior doorway have been lost. The lintel is decorated with a winged sun-disk and the surviving column with painted stripes. The interior doorway has a similar lintel, but its left jamb is lost. The right jamb bears a prayer to Atum on behalf of the prophet of Wsr-? Harwa. There is a painted round-topped stela in the centre of the doorway consisting of three registers. The upper register contains a winged sun-disk with winged uraei. The deceased stands on the right of the central register in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind stand Ra-Horakhty and the goddess Maat. The lower register consists of three lines naming Harwa, son of ?r, son of P?-d?-?st and the lady Šp-n-wn . The doorways rest on a base which carries a prayer on behalf of Harwa. The stela is much cracked and worn and has lost several of its architectural attachments, which had been joined to the main stela by wooden pegs. It appears that in several places the painted plaster has been applied over a piece of linen stuck to the surface of the wood. The background between the doorways and at the top of the stela appears to have been red, of which traces   remain. The backgrounds of the lintels are yellow. The disks are green and the uraei are yellow outlined in black. The wings are in three sections: yellow outlined in black on the top, blue with red tips, and green with red tips. The lintels are decorated with splashes of red, blue, and green. The surviving column of the exterior doorway is yellow with green and red stripes. The surviving jamb of the interior doorway is yellow with a blue border and its text is green. The base attachment is similarly painted. The interior stela has a multi-coloured border of red, blue, orange, and green rectangles separated by one black and two white stripes and all edged in green along three sides and between the registers. The background of the upper register is green. The disk is green and the wings again are tripartite: yellow outlined in black, green, and then blue feathers both on yellow ground. The uraei are yellow with black details and the šn-signs which they enclose are also yellow. The figures and objects in the second register are all yellow with black details including the black hieroglyphs on a yellow background. The general background of this register is blue and it has been applied around the figures which thus resemble sunk relief.

The area above the lintel and the right column of the exterior doorway have been lost. The lintel is decorated with a winged sun-disk and the surviving column with painted stripes. The interior doorway has a similar lintel, but its left jamb is lost. The right jamb bears a prayer to Atum on behalf of the prophet of Wsr-? Harwa. There is a painted round-topped stela in the centre of the doorway consisting of three registers. The upper register contains a winged sun-disk with winged uraei. The deceased stands on the right of the central register in adoration before an altar on which rests a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. Behind stand Ra-Horakhty and the goddess Maat. The lower register consists of three lines naming Harwa, son of ?r, son of P?-d?-?st and the lady Šp-n-wn . The doorways rest on a base which carries a prayer on behalf of Harwa. The stela is much cracked and worn and has lost several of its architectural attachments, which had been joined to the main stela by wooden pegs.

above door (A) are two palace-façade representations between which is a panel bearing a scene in which Tjetji and his wife Debet are shown seated on either side of an offering-table; the names of standard food- and drink-offerings are written above and below the table. Underneath is part of a single line of text containing the titles and names of Tjetji and Debet.  Only the lower parts of the principal side-panels of the door are preserved; they are occupied by standing figures of the the deceased persons.  On the left is Tjetji shown wearing full dress with leopard-skin robe, attended by three children; at the top his grandson Pt?-wsr, below, his son, W?š-?‘.f-r‘ and, clutching Tjetji's staff, his eldest son, Wr-?r.n(?).  On the right Debet is shown accompanied by two boys and three women: in front, her son (?) '.....z?.f and her grandson ???-n?s; behind are two daughters, both called Nfrt-??-?‘.f-r‘, and a granddaughter W?zt-k?w. The whole doorway is carved in very fine, sunk relief with good modelling of the figures, careful forms for the hieroglyphs and fine detail. The surface is much worn and very pitted with small holes; there is some surface deterioration due to salting. Some traces of paint remain: part of the palace-façade detail is picked out in black and red on the right and left at the top; the colours are especially well preserved on the left; the cross-pieces are painted black with red on the intervening surfaces; the wigs of the figures in the top panel retain some black, and there are traces of red on a number of the meat-offerings and on the sliced loaves on the offering-table.    At the top of door (B), two representations of the palace-façade flank a panel bearing seated figures of Tjetji and Debet on either side of an offering-table with the names of conventional offerings written above and below the table.  Underneath is a single line of text containing the names and titles of the deceased and his wife. The doorway proper consists of a drum bearing the name and titles of Tjetji and two jambs bearing standing figures of Tjetji and Debet ; in the case of the present monument, however, texts are preserved above the figures giving the full titularies of Tjetji and Debet. On the left jamb Tjetji is shown, dressed less formally, accompanied by three boys: his eldest son Werirny, his son Wash-Khafra, and his grandson Ptahwoser.  Only the upper half of the right jamb is preserved; below the six lines of text giving her titles is the top of a figure of Debet who is accompanied by one daughter, Nefret-ha-Khafra. On the outer sides of the jambs are sloping panels bearing representations of tall offering-stands. The whole doorway is carved in very fine, sunk relief with good modelling of the figures, careful forms for the hieroglyphs and fine detail.
