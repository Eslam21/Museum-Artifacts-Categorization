{"artifact_name": "sealstone", "Object Type": ["sealstone"], "Museum number": ["1867,0507.472"], "Description": [" Sard intaglio: the subject is portrayed with extraordinary refinement of detail and manipulation of the planes of view. The tightly curled hair recedes at the temple. The brow is deeply lined, bulging above the long, slightly hooked nose. Beside the hooded eye are crow's feet; the cheeks are deeply lined, the mouth slightly open, and the chin prominent. The neck, creased at the back, is turned at the shoulder. The Adam's apple projects to reflect the turn at the front. The subject is evidently a Roman of mature years, of the mid-first century BC; the hairstyle may be compared to Egyptian and Roman portraits from Egypt. The subject has been identified as the orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, who was the political opponent of both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.
