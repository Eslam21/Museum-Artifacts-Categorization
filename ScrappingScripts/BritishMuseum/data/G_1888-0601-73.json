The shape is common on Rhodes (e.g. Jacopi 1930, fig. 346; Jacopi 1933, 18-19, fig. 5, tomb II; Kinch 2014, pl. 42 no. 18.1, tomb 18). A related shape of similar fabric with one handle is also attested at Naukratis; the shape of the latter recalls vessels found on Cyprus (e.g. Salamis). The production place(s) of these bottles, which are characteristically heavy, has not yet been determined but must be sought in the Eastern Mediterranean area. Webb (1997, 8 no. 28 with refs) considers the examples found in Cyprus to be 'debased miniature versions of imported Phoenician red-slipped 'mushroom-lipped' jugs' made locally for votive use in the 7th and 6th centuries BC. An example found on Rhodes, with a Greek (?) graffito, still retained remains of its content (A. Couli\u00e9 in Couli\u00e9 and Filimonos-Tsopotou 2014, 235 no. 69).
