The black Nile mud clay has been decanted and mixed with an extremely fine organic temper. The sherd is of a bowl decorated in the C-Group style that was common during the Old Kerma period. The bowl had a small flat base, a carinated body and a bevelled rim. The interior surface and lip was grey while the exterior surface was orange. The decoration is particularly well executed: a strip with a XXX motif below the lip and a geometrical pattern on the body - here, concentric diamonds on a background of small hatching made with a roller stamp. The exterior surface has been polished, that of the interior simply smoothened with a fine brush. "}
