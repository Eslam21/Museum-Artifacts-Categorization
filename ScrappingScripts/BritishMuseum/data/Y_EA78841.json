{"artifact_name": "textile; wrapping; trousers(?)", "Object Type": [" textile ", " wrapping ", " trousers (?) "], "Museum number": ["EA78841"], "Description": [" Several fragments of a natural-coloured wool textile, probably originally part of a pair of trousers, used as wrapping. The weave is plain and weft-face. The spinning direction of warp and weft is 's'. The thread count is warp 7 per 10mm and weft 18 per 10mm. The selvedge is reinforced with 2 warp cords. The hem at the waist is 35mm wide and there is a 'v'-shaped opening for a cord. The seams are flat-felled. Some areas have been darned with paired natural-coloured 's'-spun wool thread and appear similar to basket-weave. The seams are sewn with wool thread, while the hem is sewn with cotton thread. Both consist of 2 's'-spun elements, 'z'-plied.
