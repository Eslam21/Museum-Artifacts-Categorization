{"artifact_name": "kohl-tube(?)", "Object Type": ["kohl-tube (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA68394"], "Description": [" Fragment of cylindrical form presumably from a vessel, possibly from a 'kohl'-tube: with thick walls. Opaque pale-blue body with glossy surface. The decorations were impressed but only two elements survive, a prefabricated register of white chevrons on a dark-blue field and an 'eye' of circular form in dark-blue glass enclosing a white thread within its circumference. As the core has been removed it is probable that, if this fragment is from a vessel, it came from the neck. It is impossible to determine with certainty whether the chevron band was originally vertical or horizontal.
