", " As other deities involved in the protection of childhood and pregnancy, such as Taweret and Pataikos, Bes is very popular among Naukratis amulets (Masson forthcoming). His amulets were similarly widespread across Egypt in the later Dynastic period (Andrews 1994, 40) and in the Mediterranean world, (especially in the Late-early Ptolemaic periods: Herrmann et al., 69). Modelled heads of Bes on a plaque or a disc, dated to the Third Intermediate Period onwards, bear sometimes the representation of a wedjat eye on the other side (Andrews 1994, 40; examples illustrated in Petrie 1914, pl. XXXIV no. 190q; Hornung, Staehelin 1976, no. 694). It is probably not the case here (only front view available). On amulets of Bes in general see: Andrews 1994, 38-40; Herrmann et al. 2010, 69-73 (type 34). Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot, while Boston registers state Naukratis as a context of discovery.
