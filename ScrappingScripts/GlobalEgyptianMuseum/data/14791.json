He was also identified with the moon Iah, and was called \"Lord of the Moon Eye.\" In this role, he became the protector and saver of the eyes. He was also the god of the calendar, as it was easy to count the days by watching the crescent moon in its nightly development. He became the patron deity of scribes and physicians and the assistant to Osiris in the court of justice who read the verdict.On the head of the baboon, personifying Thoth, are both the sun disk and the crescent moon protected by the cobra. The seated baboon is concealed up to the knees in a cover without any details. From his neck hangs a pectoral showing the Udjat eye of protection between the two feathers of Maat the goddess of justice; below them is the sign meaning \"all.\" Details of the hands and feet are carved with care."}
