The headdress indicates that Osiris is a lunar deity because Seth tore his body into 14 pieces, the number of days of the waning moon.The hands of the statue are not pierced which means he did not hold any emblems. The ibis, a large bird of the Nile, is depicted because it was widely associated with the god Iah, sacred to the moon. Together with the sky god, Shu, Iah became the Protector of Osiris."}
