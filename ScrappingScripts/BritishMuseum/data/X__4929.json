{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Silen's head, probably from a console. Plaster head of a satyr or Silen. Possibly used as a model for a stone sculpture. Seems to have been painted red-brown on the beard abd with brown eyes. Plaster has frequent vesicles. Coarse white plaster containing a little grog. Broken away at the back where it was formerly attached to the wall. Most of the acanthus decoration broken away at the bottom and, doubtless, originally also to both sides of the head. Part of the top surface preserved, showing the impression of the wood-planking of the ceiling. Traces of brownish pigment on eyes, eyebrows, nostrils, beard and edge of garland. The fragment preserves the head of a silen incline forward through an angle of about 45\u00b0 and part of an approximately vertical surface below decorated with acanthus leaves. It appears to have been mounted in the angle between wall and ceiling.

These are difficult to date with reference to plaster modelling in Italy and elsewhere and are probably rather to be seen against the background of the Egyptian employment of stucco for elements that would elsewhere probably be executed in marble. The present example seems to have formed part of a human-headed console of a kind met with in marble in Imperial Roman times, e.g. Arif Miifid Mansel, Ernin Bosch and Jale inan, Side 1947 pIs. 14-15, figs. 14-16.
