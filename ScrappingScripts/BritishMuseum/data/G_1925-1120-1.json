{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of pipe-player. A somewhat grotesque man, rather Pan-like, playing panpipes. He appears to be bald and his ears are very large and badly rendered. He stands with his legs apart and wears a short tunic girt at the waist, with short sleeves and a loop of cloth over his belly. Just below this loop is a hole where his separately made large phallus was inserted and held by plaster that still remains: the phallus is lost. The back has summary modelling and a loop for suspension is applied to the back of the neck. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt; a very few traces of a white dressing survive.
