On top of the ovoid body of the vessel is a straight neck which has a rim with a flared lip; the black stains visible on the body result from the cramming together of the pots in the kiln. The shoulder of the vase is enhanced by a double line of incised zig-zags surmounted by a band of lozenges. The coarse fabric is fawn-coloured. This type of vessel is characteristic of the second phase of the C-group, dating c. 1750 BC."}
