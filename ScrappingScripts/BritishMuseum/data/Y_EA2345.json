{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2345"], "Description": [" Fragmentary limestone head of a male figure, only the front section of the head now remaining. He wears a striated wig that has broken off at the ears. A faded red colour is visilbe on the left side. His eyebrows are arched and modelled in raised relief. His eyes are narrow, with a thick incised line around the lids and a cosmetic line at the outer corners. His nose is long and broad at the nostrils, with a clear cupid\u2019s bow above the upper lip. The outer corners of his mouth are upturned to form a small smile. Small traces of a red-brown paint are visible on the lower ears and the jawline, likely used to convey the skin. At the chin is a small broken section of stone that possibly was once a beard. There are numerous small cracks across the stone surface. The tip of the nose is missing and there is damage across the eyebrows and left eye. The object is now attached to a small modern base.
