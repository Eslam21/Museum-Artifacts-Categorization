{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA14390"], "Description": [" Plaster head of a male figure. He wears a tight-fitting skullcap crown with a uraeus cobra at the forehead. The body of the uraeus is thick and wide, though its head and sun-disc crown is now lost. The surface of the head is flaking and powdery, and many of the original facial features are now worn and lost. The outline of the eyes and nose are barely visible, but the mouth is mostly faded. The jawline appears fleshy and rounded. At the reverse there is no indication of a back-pillar. There are some small abrasions to the uneven surface, and the head is now supported on a small modern base. "], "Cultures/periods": [" 20th Dynasty (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
