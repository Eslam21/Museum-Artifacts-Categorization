They reveal that the artist was interested in biblical and mythological subject-matter, set in naturalistic landscapes drawn with considerable freedom and expertise. Given that the artist was born in 1644, they probably both date from the 1660s or later. They exhibit knowledge of Venetian landscapes of the sixteenth century by Titian and Domenico Campagnola, and although they do not immediately recall the work of Rembrandt, they resemble drawings by Pieter de With, two of whose drawings are dated 1659, and Johannes Leupenius (1643-93). The figures are comparable both to Titian and to Van Dyck. The latter was an important influence on the elder Jan Lievens, who worked with or near Van Dyck for much of the time between around 1632-44, when in London and Antwerp. Presumably he passed his interest in Van Dyck's work to his son, who here based the Virgin and Christ child on Schelte \u00e0 Bolswert's engraving after Van Dyck's 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt'.[1] The landscape background is stylistically impossible to separate from the large group of landscape drawings attributed to the elder Jan Lievens (see further under the biography of Jan Andrea Lievens).
