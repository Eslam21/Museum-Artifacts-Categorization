Simple hand-made rider figurines were made in the Nile Delta of Egypt during the Late Period and have been found in Naukratis (British Museum GR1886,0401.1468; Higgins 1954, 407; GR1973,0501.18?; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA599; Bristol Museum, H2223; Bolton Museum, 1966.93), Toukh el Karenis (Cairo Museum TR14/1/34/5= SR5/1744), unprovenanced (Cairo Museum TR14/1/34/6=SR5/1849; CG32901=SR5/ 1835). They were possibly copying 'Persian rider' types (see British Museum GR1888,0601.90) or Cypriot or Greek types. This fragment may be from the leg or arm of a rider. The fine fabric resembles that of some Egyptian Nile silt pieces and some East Greek pieces from Naukratis. GR.2011,5009.290 to GR.2011,5009.295 are all in the same style, but come from more than one example."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DB.013) (Phase 1)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" mammal ", " cavalry "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1886 (?)"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["2011,5009.295"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 30 Sep 2011"]}
