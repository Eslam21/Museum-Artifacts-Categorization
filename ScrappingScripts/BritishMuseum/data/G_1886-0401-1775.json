Portable stoves and braziers are attested in the Greek world from at least the Archaic period onwards (cf. e.g. Aydemir 2005, 94-7); examples with similar lugs are known e.g. from late 6th-5th century BC contexts in the Athenian Agora (Sparkes and Talcott 1970, 232-3, 377 nos 2017-2019, pl. 97; no. 2018 is the closest parallel for the fragment from Naukratis). In the Hellenistic period more ornate braziers become common (Bailey 2008; \u015eahin 2001, 91-132). Petrie discusses the examples of stoves found at Naukratis and their chronology in his excavation report (Naukratis I, p. 42) and notes that \"a complete set of all the types of development has been kept for the British Museum, and other sets presented to other collections\".
