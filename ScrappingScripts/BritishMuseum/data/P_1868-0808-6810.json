He wears a shirt, sash, and spurred boots only, and has a bleeding wound. He declaims angrily: \"Regicides, Parricides, Fratricides, & Patricides, this is the Effects of your Insatiable thirst for Conquest, this is Your reward for my Glorious Achievements in Italy, Germany, &c - to die by the Hand of an Assassin, - a D------d Musselman; & all my Brave Legions Destroyed by Water Melons & the Arabs. Go Murderers in Cold Blood; may your Conscious Guilt ever prey upon your Vitals; & may the Name of Nelson ever haunt you Sleeping & waking.\" The Directors, wearing their plumed hats (except one whose hair rises) and elaborate cloaks (see BMSat 9199), shrink in terror. They are seated at an oblong table on which is a paper: 'Item to send Buonaparte to Egypt to prevent his organizing the Directory.' 1 January 1799 Hand-coloured etching "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: Isaac Cruikshank ", " Published by: S W Fores "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1799"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 242 millimetres ", " Width: 341 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VII, 1942) A report of Bonaparte's assassination in Cairo was received in London on 14 Dec.
