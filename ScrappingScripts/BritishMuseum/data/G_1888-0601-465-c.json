The sherd probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965,0930.338. Lemos describes other sherds from the vase as coming from a mediocre, but big chalice belonging to the Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1571) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.465.c"], "Joined objects": [" Potential Join Group: G16288 (2 objects) ", " Associated Group: G16287 (6 objects) "]}
