{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37494"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta female acrobat (its comparanda thought by others to be male), seated with knees pressed against her body, and supporting on upraised hands an object largely broken away, but having a lower horizontal moulding at the rear. She is naked except for briefs, marked with impressions (to represent an animal skin?), and has a necklace with three strung elements: two beads and a pendant. Her hair is cut short. Summary treatment at the back. Feet repaired in plaster, but now damaged: perhaps an ancient repair. The left knee is broken away. A hole has been bored underneath for a modern stand. Two-piece mould. The back design does not 'fit' the front, in that the rear of the head is enormous compared with the face, neither do the arms match nor does the rump. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt. Slight traces of an overall white dressing.
