{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "56.20.486a", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MUMMY LABEL", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "INCISED; PAINTED", "Height": "15.5 cm", "Name": "Wooden mummy label", "Description": "During the Graeco-Roman Period bodies were regularly transported from the home to the cemetery, and, if the person died away from home, back to their village, and they were usually identified with mummy labels such as this one. The labels were made from wood or stone and often inscribed with a short text in Greek or demotic giving details such as name, age and home-town, for the poor it seems the labels replaced traditional stelae.  This label has an ink drawing of the god Anubis, seated on a pedestal with a key around his neck and a burning torch before him."}
