{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1972,0125.2"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Seilnos (or Bes?). A terracotta model of a bronze vessel-foot in the form of a half-figure of Seilenos surmounting a row of acanthus leaves above four phalanges of a lion\u2019s paw extending onto a polygonally domed plinth. Seilenos has receding hair and a full beard spreading over his chest. He is posed with his arms akimbo, his hands on his rather generous waist. There is summary modelling at the back, and the projecting support for the vessel is flaked away: whether it (together with companion pieces) ever supported a vessel is uncertain, and it may have been used in its own right as a \u2018votive\u2019 object. Something has flaked away from the top of the head, possibly a wreath. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt.
