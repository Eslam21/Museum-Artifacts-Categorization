{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86170"], "Description": [" Scarab, made of glazed steatite, the back as well as the base is partly chipped of. The steatite is of a grey colour, a beige glaze is preserved everywhere, the hieroglyphs in the base show a faint green colour. The division between head and prothorax is indicated by a line. The division between prothorax and elytra is shown in a line that consists of two upwards bended parts. The suture is shown by a line as well. The head is of a trapezoidal shape, no eyes are visible. The clypeus is not preserved, the plates are visible, the one on the left side is divided in two subparts by a line, while the one on the right side is not. The side of the scarab shows two lateral lines on each side to separate the scarab from the baseplate. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, with three recognizable signs in it. On the right an ankh-sign, on the left a sign that was described as a nfr-sign by the EES object card but there are further lines that look like a raised arm? The sign in the middle is not easy to define as well, can this be a fish turned by 90 degrees and further signs above that are broken off? The longitudinal perforation is fully preserved.
