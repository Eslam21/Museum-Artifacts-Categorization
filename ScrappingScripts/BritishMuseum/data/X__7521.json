", " The beads pertaining to this reconstructed necklace could have been found in various contexts in Naukratis: the glass beads are later in date than the wedjat-eye within an oval serrated frame (Late Period, especially 26th dynasty). However, a trench done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos provided many beads along numerous amulets (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming).
