In each hand, he was holding a roll, symbol of authority. The statue is sculpted from dark pink granite. The style of the sculpture is the typically idealistic style of the Old Kingdom, which depicted the king as being young, strong and very well built. His features are idealized, especially his eyes, which are gazing into eternity"}
