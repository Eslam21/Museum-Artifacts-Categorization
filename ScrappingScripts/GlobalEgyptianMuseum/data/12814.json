{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "1073 (= 2)", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "56 cm", "Width": "35 cm", "Depth": "7.5 cm", "Name": "Stela of Hr(w)", "Description": "Round-topped stela with text field of 7 horizontal lines of incised hieroglyphs (Inscription A) in the upper half, and in the lower half a depiction in relief of the owner seated at a table of offerings. The first line of the inscription has suffered heavily from the erosion affecting the uppermost 8 cm of the stela. The last four signs of the main hieroglyphic text intrude into the offering scene behind the head of the owner, and his name and title are repeated between the figure of the owner and the offerings (Inscription B). The table bears a stylized row of tall loaves, incised only around the edges, with traces of red paint and red outline draft lines visi-ble; above are piled cuts of meat, lettuce and fruits, and at the top a series of five loaves and six stone vessels. Most offerings bear red pigment traces, and the lettuce green pigment. Ei-ther side of the table leg stand a sealed red-painted vessels on a jar-stand and a lettuce. The owner is shown to the left, seated on a rectangular-legged chair; he has close-cropped hair, and wears a plain collar, transverse band across the torso, simple kilt with belt and knot, and he holds in one hand a long staff and in the other a kerchief. Red pigment remains over the flesh areas. In the instep of his right foot can be seen the back of his left foot; the profile em-phasizes his breast pendulous and three folds of the lower chest. "}
