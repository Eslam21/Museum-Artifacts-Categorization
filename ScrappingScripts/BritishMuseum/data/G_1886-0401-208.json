The lack of rim and other diagnostic elements prevents the confirmation on the cup shape. Type 5 cups are both the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site. Type 9 cups were the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis and the shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18). Both types have been found in large numbers at in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. The number in Petrie's catalogue, 83, is written on the exterior surface of the sherd."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis. Part I., 1884-85 (pl.
