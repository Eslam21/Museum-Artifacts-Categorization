{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.50"], "Description": [" A male and a female terracotta mould-made figure, naked and modelled in the round, in sexual intercourse. The man, very much smaller than the woman, kneels and holds his huge phallus to her. She is on hands and knees in front of him, resting her arms and head on a pile of cushions; her hair (or wig) is short and she faces to her right, but the man\u2019s head is lost. The group is supported by a low rectangular plinth. Solid; two-piece mould, with a cut-out area below the woman\u2019s body. Micaceous (very small particles) brown Nile silt with a red and grey core, and many white grits; a few traces of a white dressing survive; pink paint remains on a small area between the man\u2019s feet.
