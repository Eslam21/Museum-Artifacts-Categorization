The hieroglyphs are probably used here for their magical value as often for this type of scarab (Gorton 1996, 93). Falcon is a common theme on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d and appears on various composition (on productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). This scaraboid belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 99, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype 149-158, see especially no. 151 for this piece).
