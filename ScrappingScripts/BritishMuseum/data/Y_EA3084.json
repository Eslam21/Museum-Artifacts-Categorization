{"artifact_name": "bead; clasp", "Object Type": [" bead ", " clasp "], "Museum number": ["EA3084"], "Description": [" Capped beads with a reef-knot clasp: a string of thirty-nine bright-blue glazed composition spherical beads capped with silver and a gold knot-clasp. Some of the beads still have a glassy surface. The caps of silver consist of discs varying slightly in diameter, with a hole in the centre over which a tube is soldered. The tubes cover an inner cylinder made of a rolled length of copper pushed into the opening in the bead. One bead has a disc missing and only the tube remains. The gold reef-knot clasp is made in two halves, each stamped out. On the underside of one half is a flat plate cut by a central groove. On the flat underside of the other half, mounted on a strip of gold, is a flange which fits into the groove and joins the two halves together.
