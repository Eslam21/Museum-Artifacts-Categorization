XXXVII, no. 94). The \"Scarab Factory\" in Naukratis produced close variants of the name of Amun-Ra on scarabs and scaraboids made out of glazed composition (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 25 and 36; on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Webb forthcoming). This scarab belongs to a type which was distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Greece and Punic sites (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI, subtype 23-24, see especially 24 for this piece; a type which is well-related to her larger type XXVIII B).
