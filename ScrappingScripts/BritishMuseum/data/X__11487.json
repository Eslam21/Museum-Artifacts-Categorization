", " 6th century BC parallels from Ayia Irini as either single men or as part of a chariot group (Karageorghis 2003, 191-5, nos 220-2, 224). Many parallels from Salamis (Monloup, T. 1984, nos 439-497, 520-536). Under the number 1911.44, a mixed batch of objects were originally registered; the sub-numbers were assigned on 11.5.2000. Parallel from Lindos (Blinkenberg 1931, pl.86, no.1947). A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.
