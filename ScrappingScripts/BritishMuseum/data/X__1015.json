Similar examples are usually dated late 4th to early 3rd century BC (Fischer 1993, pl.3. no.16, unprovenanced), or Late Period to early Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.35, no.51; Bailey 2008, nos 3237-8), although Besques dates one to the Roman period (Besques 1992, pl.79, no.E401). The jar seems to be of a Late Period type, typical of the 7th to 4th centuries BC.The closest parallels come from Naukratis (British Museum GR1973,0501.2, GR1973,0501.63, GR1973,0501.64, GR1973,0501.75; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.94.1914, E.95.1914 and E.145.1914; Another mould series British Museum GR1973,0501.47, GR1973,0501.48; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.144.1914, E.147.1914;see also British Museum GR 1973,0501.64; Bailey 2008, nos 3237-8). Note the Fitzwilliam E.1914 sequence were attributed to \u2018Antinoopolis?\u2019 and the British Museum GR1973,0501 sequence were found unregistered, but that both sequences include numerous terracottas now known to be found and/ or produced at Naukratis of types that predate the founding of Antinoopolis. Uprovenanced examples from Egypt have been dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC (Fischer 1994, no. 16; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, pl.3, no.51) although Besques dates one to the Roman period (Besques 1992, pl.79, no.E401).
