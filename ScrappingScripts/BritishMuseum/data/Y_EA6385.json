{"artifact_name": "flute", "Object Type": ["flute"], "Museum number": ["EA6385"], "Description": [" Large end-flute: with four evenly spaced holes on one side. The cutting at both ends of the instrument is rough and there appears to have been no attempt at bevelling the mouthpiece; the shaping of the holes is likewise crude. There is a pronounced node about halfway down the instrument and traces of white paint on the surface and a diagonal criss-cross decoration. Traces of resin are visible inside the mouthpiece end of the instrument. The bore is cylindrical and varies considerably.
