{"artifact_name": "human mummy; mummy-wrapping; mummy-portrait", "Object Type": [" human mummy ", " mummy-wrapping ", " mummy-portrait "], "Museum number": ["EA6713"], "Description": [" Mummy of a young adult man with wooden portrait panel in tempera. The portrait represents a beardless young man with curly black hair and thick eyebrows, dressed in a white tunic and mantle with a pink 'clavus' visible at the left. The painter has taken care to create shading effects on the skin, using individual brush-strokes. The image appears to reflect the true age of the deceased. The mummy is wrapped in layers of cloth. Although it now appears rather plain, the portrait may originally have been set within a stuccoed and gilded outer surface, of which only small fragments now survive. There is no inscription to identify the deceased. Skull - Mouth slightly open. No fractures. The cervical spine appears to be intact. Thorax and Abdomen - These cavities appear to be empty. There is an opacity on the right of the lower dorsal vertebrae which might represent an ablated heart. No obvious fractures of ribs, spinal column, pelvis, or hips. Arms - Extended. Hands with extended fingers, the palm upon the outer aspect of the thighs. Legs - Appear normal. No lines of arrested growth. The shell of a small bivalve mollusc is adjacent to the mid-shaft of the right tibia.
