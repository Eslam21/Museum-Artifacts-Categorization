{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["1888,1210.1"], "Description": [" Marble head from a statue of Octavian: in the style of a Hellenistic prince. The lower edge of the neck, fashioned as a tenon to fit into a draped torso (the join then concealed by drapery), is lost. The proper left ear is chipped. The surface is damaged at the outer end of the proper left eyebrow, to the left of the mouth, and at the left edge of the neck. The nose has been replaced, the glued join concealed. The restoration necessitated some superficial reworking of the lips and chin. In general the head, which is carved in Carrara marble with some mineral inclusions, has the appearance of an ancient piece cleaned and reworked for the antiquities market. Octavian appears pensive, his abundant thick locks of hair kept well clear of the high brow and broad face.
