In her left hand she holds a roll of papyrus, and she is shown praying to the god Amun of Karnak. Amun, shown with two feathered plumes on his head, is holding the Ankh sign of life in his left hand and the \"Was\" scepter, symbol of prosperity, in his right hand, while a vase containing a lotus flower is at his feet. He is preceded by the god Khonsu who has the lunar disk on his head and holds the three emblems of stability, power, and life. The lower part of the stela is decorated with four hieroglyphic lines of text, which are executed in a better style than those on the upper part where the cartouche of King Osorkon appears."}
