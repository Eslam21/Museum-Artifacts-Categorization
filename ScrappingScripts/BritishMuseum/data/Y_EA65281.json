Natural oyster-shells inscribed with royal names may have been a military decoration (see Winlock in 'Griffith Studies' (London, 1932), 388-91). The shell represented is probably 'Avicula (Meleagrina) margaritacea' (see H. E. Winlock, \u2018The Treasure of Three Egyptian Princesses\u2019 (New York, 1948), 25, n. 33: Petrie's 'Meleagrina margaritifera', see W. M. F. Petrie, \u2018Amulets\u2019 (London, 1914), 27, no. 112).

However, its interest lies in the rather crudely engraved cartouche, purporting to be of the 12th dynasty (early second millennium BC). Microscopic examination clearly shows that the lines were created by engraving, a technique not in use at this date. Thus the inscription cannot be of the date ascribed to it. This view is reinforced by the crispness of the engraved line compared to the rest of the pendant, also suggesting the cartouche is much more recent.
