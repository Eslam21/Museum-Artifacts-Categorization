They were found in the Tomb of Mesehti at Asiut. Each archer is holding in one hand a bow and in the other a bunch of arrows. They are wearing red kilts with green designs and a flap of cloth in the center decorated with green geometrical designs. They wear black curled wigs, white headbands, anklets, and necklaces. The whites of their eyes give life to the black bodies. The archers are all shown barefoot, with their left legs stretched forward so that they appear to be marching in unison with long strides."}
