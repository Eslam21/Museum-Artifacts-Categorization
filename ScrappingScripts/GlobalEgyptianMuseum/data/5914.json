The smooth pots with black insides and red outsides with black tops have a long and varied history. These elegant vessels, all made with very thin sides without a potter's wheel, were originally also produced in Egypt, but only in the Predynastic Period. Like many other things, they survived in Nubia while other techniques and shapes were developed in dynastic Egypt. Not only the inhabitants of the Nubian Nile valley (A and C-Group Cultures) had this ware, but also the Pangrave Culture. An example like this, with a wide stripe around the rim, is characteristic ware for this culture.The bowl was found in a tomb not far from the head of the deceased. Evidently it was meant as a vessel for food."}
