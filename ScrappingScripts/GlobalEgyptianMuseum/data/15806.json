This round-top stela is divided into two registers, or sections. The upper register is decorated with scenes showing the king sitting on his throne and receiving Tefnakht and the Saitic Princes, who are represented as kissing the ground before the victorious king. The princes' names are written in cartouches and they are given titles as kings. The lower register is inscribed with a long text relating the story of the military expedition of Piankhi against the land of Egypt. The style of the account is reminiscent of the epic tone and propagandist character of the celebratory texts of New Kingdom kings, such as the Poem of Pentaur describing the Battle of Kadesh."}
