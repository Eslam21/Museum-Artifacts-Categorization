{"artifact_name": "textile", "Object Type": ["textile"], "Museum number": ["EA30096"], "Description": [" Textile fragments; seven pieces of linen, of both coarse and fine weave, some fringed. A = squarish fragment of medium quality linen cloth; one plain selvedge, other edges torn. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.22 ends per 10mm and weft c.10 picks per 10mm. B = Irregular fragment of medium-fine quality linen cloth; undyed but now cream-beige with darker stains. One plain selvedge with crowded warp threads; a very worn area and another area with closely spaced warp ends but not adjacent to a selvedge. Edges other than the selvedge are ragged. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.30-16 ends per 10mm and weft c.11 picks per 10mm. C = Rectangular fragment of medium-fine quality linen; undyed but now cream with some darker stains. Rolled hem along one end, and just in from this are two bands where a couple of weft threads have been omitted or removed; other edges are torn or ragged. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.31 ends per 10mm and weft c.16 picks per 10mm. The rolled hem is whipped in S-spliced, S-twisted linen thread (and is not plied). This hem probably enlcoses a second end of cloth. Narrow bands of empty warp was probably not caused accidentally (by tearing or pulling out threads) because an even number of threads are missing. D = Long, torn strip of linen with a fringed selvedge along one side. It was undyed, but now cream/beige in colour, with darker stains. Lengthways folds suggests that this grament had been use for tying. Fringe is worn. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.26 ends per 10mm and weft c.10 picks per 10mm. E = Fragment of linen in a coarse, open weave; undyed; rolled hem along one end which hides the original edge, other edges ragged. Rolled hem is whipped in S-spliced, S-twisted 2 Z-ply linen thread. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.9 ends per 10mm and weft c.7 picks per 10mm. F = Ragged fragment of medium-fine quality linen cloth; undyed and now cream/beige in colour with darker stains. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.26 ends per 10mm and weft c197 picks per 10mm. Edges are ragged, and with a diagonal (modern) cut. G = Torn strip of medium-coarse quality linen; lengthways wrinkles suggests that had been used for tying; undyed but now cream-beige in colour. Other edges torn, ends ragged. The weave is plain [warp-faced simple tabby] and the threads are S-spliced and S-twisted; the stitch gauge is warp c.19 ends per 10mm and weft c.9 picks per 10mm.
