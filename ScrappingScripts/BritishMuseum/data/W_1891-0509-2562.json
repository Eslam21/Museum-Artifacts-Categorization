{"artifact_name": "cylinder seal", "Object Type": ["cylinder seal"], "Museum number": ["89120"], "Description": [" Hematite cylinder seal; the design may orignally have consisted of two suppliant goddesses facing each other one with one either side of a three-line inscription. The inscription was erased and the king with a mace was cut facing right, to a slightly larger scale than the goddesses; a crescent above a spade and a star above a lightning fork were added in the field between the figures and a three-line inscription was added behind the goddesses. Still later the first two lines of the inscription were obliterated by the cutting of two \"bow-legged dwarfs\" tete-beche. Only the third line of the inscription is partially legible.
