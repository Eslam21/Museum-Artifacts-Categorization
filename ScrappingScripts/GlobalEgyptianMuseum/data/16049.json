{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE N.Alex.3447", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COIN", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Diameter": "1.700 cm", "Name": "Overstruck Byzantine Coin of Heraclius", "Description": "The Byzantine bronze coin depicts the Emperor Heraclius who reigned from AD 610 to AD 641. The coin was made at the mint in Alexandria. The denomination of the coin was originally six nummia. However, it has been overstruck to a value of 12 nummia. The front side of the coin shows a cross potent standing on two steps. The cross potent is a cross with bars at the end of each arm. The reverse side of the coins is marked with the letter 'S' within a thick border. According to the historical record, the seventh century was full of disasters, which affected coin value. A rapid and continuous depreciation of the value of the bronze coins in comparison with gold was remarkable during that time. In AD 629 to AD 630 Heraclius tried to reform the bronze coinage to prevent it from collapse during the financial difficulties after the Persian war; the attempt failed. It may be that the authorities of the mint of Alexandria had deliberately withdrawn the 12 nummia coins from circulation and had overstruck them as 6 nummia, in other words, giving them their actual purchasing power. Overstriking was a common practice during the time of Heraclius."}
