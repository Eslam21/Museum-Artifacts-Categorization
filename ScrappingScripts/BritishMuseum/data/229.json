figure of the kneeling male official Hornebkhaset on a slim rectangular base.  The figure is depicted in a kneeling position and resting on his heels, while he supports a small naos shrine in his lap. The shrine contains the image of the funerary god Osiris, identifiable through his mummified form, feathered atef-crown, and the crook and flail implements held in his hands. Hornebkhaset wears a knee-length kilt which is belted at the waist and a smooth shoulder-length ‘bag wig’, a simple headcloth style typical of the 26th Dynasty. The chest is bare, with subtle modelling of the musculature of the upper body.

The chest is protruding and separated by a line in the centre. Three angular tresses are falling down in the front over chest and upper arms on either side. Nine broad and flat tresses are falling down the back with the outermost left one being centrally grooved; their lower edge is only slightly arched and the edges rounded. On the sides of the neck the tresses are separated by a tapered cut. Down to the hips the arms are mostly separated from the body.

Standing youth; preserved from neck to thigh; the head is missing, so are the left leg from the thigh and the right leg from below the knee.  The figure stands to the front, the weight on both legs, the left slightly advanced. The youth is wearing a chiton and a himation; the sleeves of the chiton are indicated by horizontal grooves on the upper arms (not to be misread as armlets), its edge is visible around the neck. The himation is slung around the left shoulder, the edges are indicated by diagonal incised lines across the chest and and back. Other than that the body appears to be in the nude; the horizontal line of the himation's lower edge is not indicated though the oblique incision above the pubes might be its upper edge. The chest is protruding and separated by a line in the centre. Three angular tresses are falling down in the front over chest and upper arms on either side.

seated figure of the official Tetiky.<br/><br/>He wears a double-wig with long tresses of hair across the upper part of the wig and an undersection of tighter curls. His upper body appears bare, with part of a kilt belted at the waist intact between his right arm and the back of the seat. The surviving upper body shows a clear bulge around the torso area. The god's name Amun has been carved on his upper right arm.

figure of Nebamun.<br/><br/>His plaster head has been restored in modern times to join to the current break at the neck. He wears a shoulder-length striated wig based on the surviving edges of the ancient wig worn by Nebamun, and this has been painted black. His facial features and the skin colour of his face are modern renderings. His upper body is bare with clear traces of red-brown paint conveying his skin, and he is shown kneeling and resting on his heels. His clothing is not clearly delineated though a thin line on his left ankle suggests that he wears a long kilt belted at the waist.

The figure wears a calf length kilt belted at the waist, with the left leg extending outwards. Both hands are stretched out in front to support the smaller figure of the funerary god Osiris, who is identifiable via the mummified form of the body, the feathered atef-crown, and the crook and flail items held across the chest. A single column of hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the broad back-pillar with both the beginning and the conclusion of the inscription now missing.

His eyes are narrow and slanted with a thin incised line at the upper eyelid, and his eyebrows are conveyed as long, subtle ridges which converge at the bridge of the nose. His nose is broad at the nostrils, and his mouth is small with pursed lips and a clear cupid’s bow above his upper lip. A slight smile is suggested by the gentle upturning of the corners of his mouth. The face appears fleshy and rounded at the mouth, jawline, and neck. The upper body is bare, with subtle indication of the musculature and a narrowed waist.

of face is combined with the fullness of body found on royal images made late in Amenhotep III's reign. The result is a sloe-eyed little figure who looks like nothing so much as a chubby, pretty child. He is, of course, a man and probably an important one. In addition to the leopard skin vestment of a priest, he wears a short wig from which hangs a braided, curled sidelock. This headdress was worn by several different kinds of priest, from funerary priests to the High Priest of Ptah at Memphis, at this time probably the second most powerful religious office in the land (after the High Priest of Amun at Thebes) and the most prestigious. Amenhotep III's crowned prince served as High Priest of Ptah, and so, later on, did the crown prince of Ramses the Great. It is probable that the priest's name and titles were inscribed on the front of the object he held, which has been entirely sheared away, along with his hands. What remains is only the negative space connecting his arms and his body to the object. From the shape of the break, however, it appears to have been an offering table on a stand.

The result is a sloe-eyed little figure who looks like nothing so much as a chubby, pretty child. He is, of course, a man and probably an important one. In addition to the leopard skin vestment of a priest, he wears a short wig from which hangs a braided, curled sidelock. This headdress was worn by several different kinds of priest, from funerary priests to the High Priest of Ptah at Memphis, at this time probably the second most powerful religious office in the land (after the High Priest of Amun at Thebes) and the most prestigious. Amenhotep III's crowned prince served as High Priest of Ptah, and so, later on, did the crown prince of Ramses the Great. It is probable that the priest's name and titles were inscribed on the front of the object he held, which has been entirely sheared away, along with his hands. What remains is only the negative space connecting his arms and his body to the object. From the shape of the break, however, it appears to have been an offering table on a stand. Kneeling reverently, the figure was presenting offerings to a god. The fortuitous preservation of the paint, especially on the head and back, shows that this was applied lavishly and with care, from the unusually naturalistic rendering of the leopard's pelt, including the white strip of belly fur visible along his proper left side, to the use of expensive blue pigment on his sidelock and perhaps elsewhere.

His eyes are wide with a thin incised line and short pointed cosmetic lines at the outer edges. There are clear traces of white paint. His eyebrows are thin and slope down towards the temple, and are painted black. His nose is slim and aquiline, and his thick lips are pursed together. His skin is conveyed by a red-brown coloured paint which has been applied to his face and body. His head is tilted slightly creating an upwards gaze. His upper body is bare and his hands extend out towards the stela in front of him, with his palms placed on the back of the stela.

A woman seated on a birthing-stool. She leans slightly back and wears a long chiton pulled up above her right knee to leave her lower leg bare and held back by a comb-like clip resting on her thigh; her left leg is draped to the ankle. The chiton is girdled just under her breasts, with a knot at the front. She has a himation, a shawl-like cloth, over her head but showing her centre-parted hair, with two ends tucked together just above the breasts. Only the stumps of her arms remain, with finished ends: the arms were made separately and attached, presumably with plaster, but their disposition cannot certainly be decided. Her belly is distended, and she sits on the stool, which has a flat face and sides, the seat projecting at the top. Unfortunately the whole rear of the figure has broken away at the join and the appearance of the back of the stool is not known. The figure as set upon a stepped plinth, but most of it is lost.

A large himation veils her head and falls on each side, wrapped round her right arm and hand and gripped by her left hand, which is also covered in drapery; her right foot, in a pointed shoe, emerges from the hem of her chiton. Her hair is worn in the melon style, covering her ears but leaving discearrings exposed. She wore a conical, wide-brimmed hat (a tholia), but it is now lost. From her right wrist, an alabastron dangles: it is of a type common and changing little from the sixth century on, but not far into Hellenistic times, with an elongated body, rounded bottom, narrow neck and wide everted rim, with small ear-handles below the neck. The rear is largely unworked, with a small circular vent, and she stands on a low rectangular plinth, open below.   Hollow; the body was made in a two-piece mould. The head and neck were produced in a one or two-piece mould and applied to the body; the veil part of the himation was modelled and added, as was the alabastron; the plinth was also made separately and the figure luted to it. Micaceous orange-brown clay, apparently a Nile silt, with a grey core, perhaps mixed with a finer clay. Much of the overall white dressing survives, and scientific analysis shows it to be calcite. The upper and lower borders of the chiton are decorated with blue paint, and there are bands of red below the girdle and above the blue band at the bottom of the garment; the girdle is painted yellow. Her hair, mouth, earrings and shoe are painted red, and the alabastron yellow, which also has a narrow band of red paint at handle-level and red also on its mouth. There is no coloured decoration on the rear.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}},"value_combined":"_figure|figure","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"sculpture","summary_title_combined":"_sculpture|sculpture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x8949","checksum":4233206721,"id":"x8949","uuid":"5da4d4c3-ae96-3503-a873-24b20458514c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure","summary_title_combined":"_figure|figure","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}}]],"sort":"figure","type":"object name","value":"figure"}],"xtemplate":{"brief":"{\"Object Type\":{\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">figure</span>\",\"id\":\"x6729\"},\"Museum number\":\"1966,1210.1\",\"Cultures/periods\":{\"id\":\"x14428\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Ptolemaic</span>\"},\"Production date\":\"300BC\",\"Production place\":[{\"id\":\"x21094\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Made in:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Alexandria (Egypt)</span>\"}],\"Findspot\":[{\"id\":\"x31377\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Excavated/Findspot:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Mudros</span>\"}]}"}},"sort":["figure",0.7369719]},{"_index":"ciim","_type":"data","_id":"mip-o375834","_score":0.71006197,"_source":{"identifier":[{"type":"prn","prn":"YCA59056","value":"YCA59056","primary":true},{"number":"17058","prefix":"EA","big_number":"EA17058","type":"big number","value":"EA17058"},{"codex_id":"6457","type":"codex id","value":"6457"},{"registration_number":"1886,0605.31","type":"registration number","value":"1886,0605.31"},{"type":"unique object id","value":"Y_EA17058","unique_object_id":"Y_EA17058"}],"multimedia":[{"processed":{"preview":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/preview_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":333}]}},"small":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/small_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":333}]}},"large":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/large_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1300},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":963}]}},"max":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/max_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":2500},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1853}]}},"mid":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/mid_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1000},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":741}]}},"huge":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/huge_01174819_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1600},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1186}]}},"zoom":{"resizable":true,"format":"pyramid tiff","modified":1335866189385,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/4_16/67bcb968_57f6_4340_b0ac_a3d9011352a4/01174819_001.ptif","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":3395},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":2516}]}}},"sequence":0,"@link":{"type":"reference"},"view":"Full: Front","use":{"date":[{"date":1415059200000,"availability":true,"earliest":2014,"latest":2014}],"warning":false,"collection":true,"free":true},"legal":{"credit_line":"© The Trustees of the British Museum"},"admin":{"uid":"odin-1174819001","id":"1174819001","source":"odin","uuid":"1c018ee4-206d-31f8-876d-35af443a594f"},"description":[{"value":"Limestone kneeling figure shown holding an effigy of Osiris across the lap;

The lower part from about knee level is missing, as is the left shoulder. Part broken off the right upper arm. Continuous breaks beside the left arm and right below the chest.

Standing nude youth. Both lower legs are missing from the knee and are now  restored in plaster; the statuette is broken obliquely across the neck and across the thighs and rejoined with slight restorations, including the right forearm and parts of the front surface of the neck and of both thighs.  The figure is standing in a frontal position, balanced on both legs, the left advanced, the right drawn back. The arms hang stiffly at the sides, the fingers closed and grasping short rods after the Egyptian convention, with thumbs pointing downwards. At the back the hands are unworked. Only the upper arms are detached from the body.  A thick cord, like a diadem, is running across the forehead from ear to ear; above it, the hair is parted in the centre back to the crown and swept back behind, to fall in front of each shoulder in four straight tresses and down the back in eleven, three tresses are falling down onto the shoulders on either side. The whole of the hair is cut up by grooves into oblong patches; the vertical grooving is more regular than the horizontal.   The head is high and rounded; it is separated from the body by means of a fine incised line around the neck. The face is long and tapering, with a pointed chin. The ears are large, with swollen lobes. The eyes are large with protruding eyeballs and the lower lid almost horizontal; the outer angle is prolonged; the eyebrows are incised lines. The nose, which is partly broken away, is long and wide at the base. The mouth is small, with fairly straight lips, the upper slightly projecting and the corners indicating a smile; there are deep hollows under the corners. The cheeks are flat and fleeing towards the back; the chin is protruding.  The body is long and narrow, with sloping rounded shoulders, and very high breasts and waist. The breast shows an arrowhead pectoral groove underneath; the nipples and also the navel are indicated by incised circles. The stomach and the pubic area are protruding. The section is generally narrow; the back is a flattened plane with spinal groove and a small buttocks. The upper arms are very short; the elbows placed high and marked by an arrowhead groove; the thumbnails are indicated.

The figure wears a smooth cropped wig, set high on the forehead and covering the ears. His eyes are wide and rounded, with a thick upper eyelid and sunken skin underneath the eyes. Faint ridges indicate the eyebrows, which slope down towards the temple on either side of the face. His nose is broad and his mouth is wide with long, thin lips. The outer corners of the mouth are slightly upturned to suggest a small smile. The face is fleshy and rounded at the cheeks and jawline. His upper body is bare, with clear modelling of the chest, broad arms, and narrow torso.The arms are placed at the sides of the body with both fists clenched.

ancient plaster covers the interior of the wig, revealing how it was attached to the statue's head; a hole, which seems original, is in the interior top of the wig, an expected feature for a tenon for a crown, especially since a crown was probably intended to surmount the wig. Yet the hole does not extend through to the exterior. There is, however, a small square area on the top bare of glaze on which some attachment may have been fixed, such as a horned 'atef' crown. The inlaid gilded plaster diadem with streamers, set in a channel above the brow of the wig, mimics a golden ribbon. Polychrome rectangular glass inlays are in red, to imitate cornelian, alternating with robin's egg blue, to imitate turquoise. A uraeus, symbol of royalty, originally teared up at the front. The inlaid headband and streamers were once \"tied\" in a bow of lotus blossoms at the back in a pattern already a thousand years old, deriving from Old Kingdom boatmen's headgear and in turn based on plant forms. The pendant streamers ended in inlaid blue glass uraei (cobras), though only that on the proper right is preserved.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x6730","id":"x6730","uuid":"c31e86c5-da41-3cd0-8fbd-1b52e105bbf0"}},"value_combined":"_figure-fitting|figure-fitting","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"component","summary_title_combined":"_component|component","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6121","id":"x6121","uuid":"dc39d073-2637-3f7c-b3ad-d2524be4f304"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"fixture/fitting","summary_title_combined":"_fixture/fitting|fixture/fitting","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6824","id":"x6824","uuid":"d16f7449-caa6-3ff8-9e21-bc543d223742"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"fitting","summary_title_combined":"_fitting|fitting","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6821","id":"x6821","uuid":"820ff45c-c14d-35e2-b091-71e8be641930"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure-fitting","summary_title_combined":"_figure-fitting|figure-fitting","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6730","id":"x6730","uuid":"c31e86c5-da41-3cd0-8fbd-1b52e105bbf0"}}]],"sort":"figure-fitting","type":"object
