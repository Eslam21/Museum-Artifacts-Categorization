{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1412"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure head of a man in grotesque style. Broken from a figure, probably of a priest. He has an elongated bald head and large sticking-out ears; the brows are heavy and the neck is comparatively thin and was socketed into a separately made body. Solid; perhaps made in a two-piece mould (the face was certainly mould-produced, but the back of the head may have been modelled); the ears are manipulated. Traces of pink paint on the temples. Brown Nile silt with frequent fine gold mica inclusions.
