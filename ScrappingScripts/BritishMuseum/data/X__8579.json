This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Although Lemos does not describe this sherd, she does discuss British Museum 1888,0601.493.d that has a very similar motif and which she states as belonging to the Aphaia Painter. The Aphaia Painter and the group are named after the chalice found in the sanctuary of Aphaia at Aegina and vessels from this group display a thematic unity. All the vessels describe figures in garments and in particular, the lower parts of chitons and himatia. None of the vessels in this group have any filling ornament and the interior decoration of some of the vessels consists of komasts rendered in the light on dark technique. The depiction of the veiled female is reminiscent of the Chian plastic female heads. See Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA110 and British Museum 1886,0401.1218.
