{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1369"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Mehu: the stela is in the form of a doorway with a cavetto cornice and torus-moulding. A prayer is inscribed on each side of the upper lintel continuing down the jambs-the one on the left to Osiris and the one on the right to Anubis, both on behalf of the overseer of the portal Mehu. There are two scenes in sunk relief on the central area of the doorway. The upper scene depicts Osiris enthroned in a shrine on the left behind an altar of offerings. He is being worshipped on the right side by Mehu and a royal prince with a sidelock holding a floral offering. The name of the prince is largely illegible, apparently Mry-'Imn(?)-p\u0292y...(?). In the lower scene Mehu is seated on the left with the king's daughter Nebuemtekh and the lady Baket. Before them is an altar heaped with offerings. On the right his daughter Mutakhet pours a libation over the altar. The stela is much battered along the edges. The upper scene is very worn and discoloured in places. The upper edge on the right side of the scene is so damaged that the hieroglyphs are barely visible. There are two drilled holes, one on the right and the other on the left of the underside of the lintel, and corresponding holes on the upper surface of the base. These were not drilled very deep in the stone and possibly were intended as supports for wooden doors.
