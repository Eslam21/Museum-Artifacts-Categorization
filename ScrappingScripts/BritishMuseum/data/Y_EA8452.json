{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8452"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela depicting Djedbastetiusankh: this small round-topped stela consists of one scene and a line of text below. The scene is bordered at the top by a curved sky-sign and on each side by the standards of the West (on the left) and presumably of the East (on the right). Above is a winged sun-disk which encloses five columns of text naming the gods and the deceased lady. Djedbastetiusankh, who stands on the right in adoration of Ra-Horakhty, a serpent, and Osiris. The surface of the stela has worn away in several places and two large holes have been drilled in the base for mounting in recent times. The background of the stela is buff. The sky-sign is blue. The standards have yellow poles with red and blue bands and blue hangings with red tips. Only the lower part of the top of the standard of the West remains, and this appears to have been blue. The sun-disk is red with yellow uraei and upper wings. The other wings appear to be green, or possibly blue now faded to green, with black lines and red edges. The female figure has a green body, blue wig, black eye, green and white cone, red dress with a blue fringe, yellow jewellery, and red and yellow cloths in her hand. Ra-Horakhty has a red disk, blue wig, white face with black eye, yellow shoulder, green black-lined collar, green hands and sceptre, and red body. The serpent is green with a blue beard, now mostly faded green, and a white and red cone. Osiris has a yellow crown with blue feathers, one now faded green, black uraeus, green face with black features and blue beard, yellow shoulder with red at the back, green black-lined collar, green hands and sceptre, and red body. The hieroglyphs are black on a yellow background between blue lines. The sides and back are plastered.
