", " Small and simple hollow terracotta figure of a woman or child. Probably locally made and of late Ptolemaic or early Roman date. Simple form looks Roman, though a similar early 2nd century BC example was published by Bayer-Niemeier (1988, pl. 3.20-1) and a damaged parallel from a late 3rd to 2nd century BC context was found in Tell Atrib (Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 180). Very similar in style to NA519 and NA678. Gutch dates NA678 to 150BC to 250AD (Gutch in Hogarth 1899, pl. 12, no. 149). Bayer-Niemeier, E. 1988. Liebieghaus Museum Alter Plastik.
