{"artifact_name": "label", "Object Type": ["label"], "Museum number": ["EA55586"], "Description": [" Ivory label for a sandal: It is well-preserved and restored from three fragments, with a hole for attachment at the top right-hand corner. The two lower corners have been cut off at an angle. On the front surface is an incised scene showing the king Den with an upraised mace, about to strike a captive. The king's name is written before him, in the centre of the top of the label. He wears a bull's tail, symbolic of fertility and ferocious power. Instead of a crown, however, Den wears an archaic version of a royal headcloth, with the rearing neck and head of a royal uraeus cobra at his forehead. That the enemy is an Easterner is indicated by his long locks and pointed beard, which resemble those on later depictions of Asiatic foes. On the right is the standard of Wepwawet and an inscription. Behind the figure of the king are three signs giving the name of the official Inka. The reverse side of the label bears an incised picture of a pair of sandals, indicating the type of object to which the label was attached.

Both Den's figure and his name face right; the king's image can actually be read as an ideographic component of his name. Throughout Egyptian history, the rightward orientation, which is shared here by the Wepwawet standard, was preferred, both for dominant figures and for writing. Thus even the prisoner's leftward orientation defines him as subordinate and inferior. A gravel-spotted desert serves as a ground line. At the right, it extends upward into a small hill that may symbolize the home of the Easterner. More significantly, it also recalls the three desert hills that make up the hieroglyphic sign for \"foreign lands\". Taken as a whole, the vignette can be read as an ideographic complement of the text \"smiting the East,\" in the same way that Den's figure completes his name. Two more inscriptions occur, one on either side of Den's body. The one behind him contains the name of Inka, a high official. The other is too archaic to be read with certainty (but see the suggestion made in the Inscription field). The figures, on the other hand, are stylistically much more developed than the schematic renderings on most other First Dynasty images. Den's long-limbed body is well proportioned. In marked contrast to the smiting king on the Narmer palette, a strong forward movement is conveyed by the angle of his body and by the way in which his heel is raised from the ground. The raised heel was later the standard means of indicating running or vigorous striding in two-dimensional figures. In later smiting scenes, the enemy's despair is indicated primarily by his supplicating gestures; here, his desperation is more vividly conveyed by the awkwardness of his unbalanced stance. The royal scene is thematically relevant, since sandals from later periods are sometimes painted with figures of enemies, so that the wearer would trample on them with every step.
