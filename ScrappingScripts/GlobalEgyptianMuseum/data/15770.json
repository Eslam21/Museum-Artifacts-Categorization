The human-headed lid is well modeled with low relief lines indicating the eyebrows, eyelids, and cosmetic lines. The relatively long wig leaves the ears and throat exposed. The stopper on the underside of the lid was apparently made on a potter's wheel. The surface of the jar bears incised lines representing two human arms. Between them is written the name of Duamutef, one of the sons of Horus and protector of the stomach."}
