", " This figure belongs to the type 106 in the typology of figure bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 201-202, 666-669, Pl. 29 a-d, Pl. 73, Typ 106). Bronze figures of Mahes were mainly discovered in Leontopolis and Bubastis where his cult as the son of Bastet was the most dynamic. A second bronze figure of Mahes, larger and fragmentary, was discovered during the first season of excavations in Naukratis, BM1885, 1101.84. It originates from the cache of bronzes (on this cache and content: Petrie 1886, 41-42; Masson 2015). It is not the case of this figure which was discovered later in Naukratis. K. Weiss (in Weiss 2012, 896, Nr. 1451) states that E.A. 683-687 corresponds to five figures of Apis; however, these registration numbers correspond to various glazed composition amulets and this bronze amuletic figure of Mahes, none features a bull.
