", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. Large amuletic figures of Sekhmet were produced in Naukratis. A terracotta mould to cast a figure of Sekhmet was discovered in the Scarab Factory (according to Museum records): Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45970; Montreal, Redpath Museum 2410. As connoted with her headdress, the goddess is associated with the solar cult. In the Late Period, lion goddesses could be identified as an emanation of Amun-Ra. In the Delta, the main cult centres for lion goddesses are Bubastis and the Memphite region.
