The statue is actually male and of a deity, represented with the typical Hellenistic attributes of Apollo. See Senff (1993, 66-8) for a modern discussion of the style and iconography, and passim for the sanctuary of Apollo-Reshef. According to Hermary, the corkscrew curls on this head, though sometimes linked to Egyptianising influences found within Ptolemaic art (and ultimately deriving from Cyrene), actual belong in a tradition of representations of Apollo in Cyprus established since the early Cypro-Classical periods (and seen on the bronze Chatsworth Apollo, and the limestone 'Zeus of Malloura') (Hermary 2009, with refs).
