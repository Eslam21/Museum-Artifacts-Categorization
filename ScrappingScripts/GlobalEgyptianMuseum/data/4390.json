The pot is a wide-mouthed, chunky krater, with two long vertical handles, and is decorated in carved bands of checkerboards, circles and lotus leaves. The shoulder of the pot is not decorated, nor is the footed base. The pot is hollowed out inside, but there are no traces of any original contents. Originally there was a lid, perhaps of a different material such as ivory, and there is a hole for the peg or pivot on top of the rim."}
