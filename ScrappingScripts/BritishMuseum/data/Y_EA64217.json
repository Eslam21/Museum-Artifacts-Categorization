{"artifact_name": "inlay; relief", "Object Type": [" inlay ", " relief "], "Museum number": ["EA64217"], "Description": [" Unidentified relief fragment: the relief, in opaque turquoise-blue glass, seems to be from the upper body of a human or divine figure represented frontally. It has the semi-circular opening for a necklace with the upper arms extended parallel to the floor. Only the upper torso is preserved. These resemblances are doubtless fortuitous. A frontal representation in glass would be most exceptional and it would be difficult to explain the position of the arms. The relief remains unidentified. The reverse has a heavy brown coating or adhesive. "], "Cultures/periods": [" New Kingdom (?) ", " Ptolemaic (?)
