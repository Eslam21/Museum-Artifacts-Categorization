The shape of the palmate seems to be late Archaic and from the context of a small architecture (altar, base, stele). Petrie allocated this fragment to the first temple of Apollo (Koenigs 2007, 335f. Cat. 31), however, this cannot apply to this fragment due to its small size and the late archaic character of the palmette.
