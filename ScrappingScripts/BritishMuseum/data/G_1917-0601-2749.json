{"artifact_name": "necklace", "Object Type": ["necklace"], "Museum number": ["1917,0601.2749"], "Description": [" Gold, amethyst and emerald necklace: the necklace features eleven egg-shaped amethysts between 1.3 and 1.7 cm long, open-set in plain gold collets with a ring at each end. The colour and translucency of the stones is thus fully displayed, since there is no gold backing. Between the amethysts are complex elements formed of a central rectangular box-setting about 3 mm deep with slightly oblique walls between two gold 'peltae'. Flat loops beneath the 'peltae' attach the elements to the rings soldered to the amethyst collets. The box-settings contain small emeralds, about 5 x 4 mm and cut perfectly flat. The terminals of the necklace are of 'pelta' and triangle shape attached to a small hook at one end and a ring at the other. The last emerald at the ring end is set diagonally. Another (third from ring end) is missing, revealing sulphur in the box-setting.
