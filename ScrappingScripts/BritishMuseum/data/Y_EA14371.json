{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA14371"], "Description": [" Limestone trial-piece: this particular example features a woman, in low relief, wearing a plain tripartite wig and vulture headdress, identifying her as a goddess. She wears a plain sheath-like costume and only the left breast is indicated, which was the convention. The stomach is doughnut shaped, also a common feature on images of Ptolemaic women. The right hand rests by the female's side, and would originally have held an 'ankh' sign. The left hand is stretched outwards and holds a lily sceptre. The portrait features show a rounded face, small chin, a narrow eye with incised pupil and a forced smile, all of which are typical of the third century BC.
