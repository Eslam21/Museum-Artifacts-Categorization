The sculpture has been restored in several occasions. The head does not correspond to the original statue, and part of the inscription on the base has been copied, maybe in Roman times. It comes most probably from Hermopolis   Baqlieh, since the inscription carved on the back pillar mentions this place together with Osiris merity, the town's local deity. It was soon removed to Italy, and probably placed inside an Iseum. The inscription mentions the whole titulature of the pharaoh, including his five royal names."}
