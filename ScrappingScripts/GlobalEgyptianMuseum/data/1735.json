{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1896:16.4", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "AMULET", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "1.4 cm", "Width": "2 cm", "Name": "Amulet of a hare", "Description": "Crudely modelled faience amulet in the shape of a desert hare, with hole in the centre for stringing on a mummy. The hare is one of a series of amulets placed on the body in mummification in the Late Period and after. The animal serves in the hieroglyphic script to write the word 'wen', meaning 'existence'. Its speed may also have been considered a desirable quality for its owner in the afterlife, though no text survives specifying the meaning of these objects to the Egyptians."}
