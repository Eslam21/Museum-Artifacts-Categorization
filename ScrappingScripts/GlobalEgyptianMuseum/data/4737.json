{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "186", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY (not before); 13TH DYNASTY ?; 13TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; ENGRAVED", "Height": "49 cm", "Width": "39 cm", "Depth": "25.5 cm", "Name": "Naos of Hori", "Description": "This naos is shaped as a \"pseudo-naos\" - a limestone cube with a rectangular ground plan - with the front and back almost twice as wide as the lateral sides. Its ground plan and sides are flat, but the top has two ridges running parallel to the lateral sides between which the surface of the naos roof curves, creating a vaulted roof. All the sides have been smoothed and provided with deeply carved hieroglyphs. The dividing lines between the columns are merely incised. Each side of the naos has an incised border. The inscriptions on the lateral sides cover only the upper half of each panel. On the front and back the inscriptions cover almost the entire height, but there are additional reliefs on these sides showing figures in sunk relief with some minor inner modelling. The persons represented are seated on the ground. The only modelling on their faces consists of the eyes, nostrils and mouths. On the back are some figures,all of which have been painted green. The front has a niche in which a seated male figure has been carved in high raised relief. The interior of the niche is not quite square, the left side has not been carved away as much as the right. The walls of the niche are smoothed. A small bench is carved against the rear wall, with a slight forward tilt, on which the male figure is seated. The figure of the man is connected to the rear wall of the niche and to the bench at various places: the top of the head, the back of the head and neck, the back, the bottom and the legs."}
