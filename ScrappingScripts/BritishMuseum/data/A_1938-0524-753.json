The form of this bead was probably copied from such foreign examples. The chemical composition (traces of barium), however, indicates that the beads were made in China. Cobalt, needed for the blue colour came from Afghanistan. Both the use of this foreign material and the form in which it was made indicate that the Chinese were in contact not merely with their neighbours in Central Asia, but through them with the lands of the Middle East. Glass beads are found, for example, in the fifth-century BC tombs as that of the Marquis Yi of Zeng.
