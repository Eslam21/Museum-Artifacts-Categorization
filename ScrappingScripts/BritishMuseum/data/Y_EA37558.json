{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA37558"], "Description": [" The upper part of a terracotta figure of Aphrodite-Isis, largely nude, with drapery round hips, no doubt falling to the ground. She is in the anadyomene pose, but holds, instead of her hair, the fillets that bind her enormous headdress of wreaths, leaves and blooms. Surmounting all is an Isis-crown of horns, disc, feathers and wheatears. She wears ball-and-disc-earrings of early Imperial type and has an oval pendant between her breasts. The back is largely plain, but her hair with a bun is shown, and also the drapery. Small circular vent. Two-piece mould. Light-brown clay with no apparent mica: perhaps a mix of Nile silt and marl.
