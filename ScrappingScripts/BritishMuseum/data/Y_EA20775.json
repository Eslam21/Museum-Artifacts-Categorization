The incantation mentions Sekhmet, Thot, Isis, Nephthys and Horus Imi-Schenut. This parallels the iconography on the reverse, expect for the replacement of Sekhmet with her consort Ptah and the appearance as Min as local god. The text is directed towards hostile beings. They are threatened with the violent wrath of the deities in question, and they will be denied what is otherwise known as a favourable fate in the afterlife, i.e. the assignment of the bas to heaven and the corpse to the underworld, the receiving of offerings, etc. All classes of people, enemies and bad things, are specifically invoked. The text thus provides a rather wide-ranging protection, probably with a special focus on spirits of the dead. Bibliography: G. Pinch, Magic in Ancient Egypt (London 1994), fig.36. G.
