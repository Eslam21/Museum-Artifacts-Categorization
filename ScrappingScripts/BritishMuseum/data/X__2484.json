", " The heart is one of the most important funerary amulets, usually placed on the upper part of the torso of the mummy (Andrews 1994, 72). Heart-shaped amuletic pendants are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (Petrie 1914, 10, pl. I no. 7). On heart amulets see: Andrews 1994, 72-73; Herrmann et al. 2010, 133 (type 78). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised by) Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
