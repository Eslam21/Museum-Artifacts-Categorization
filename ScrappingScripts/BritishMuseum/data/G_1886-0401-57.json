Adjoining the fragment with B 414 the width of the axis as well as the height of the cyma is, though not precisely, reconstructible. The jointed cyma presumably belongs to the corner pieces B 426, B 407, B 409 (reconstruction see Koenigs 2007, 333), however, the profile of the main corner piece differs on its lower ending.
