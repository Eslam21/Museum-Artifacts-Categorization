Petrie at Serabit el-Khadim  in 1905-1906. Made of blue or green faience, the plaques depict a cat sitting on a small socle and looking towards the right. There are two sorts of cats: the first group shows cats whose head is round and whose ears are small; the second group is distinguished by a small elongated head and larger ears. Five of the pieces carry royal cartouches, two of Hatshepsut and three of Tuthmosis III. The fragment represented here belongs to the first group and dates without doubt from the reign of Tuthmosis III, given its total resemblance - notice the hieroglyphic signs \"neb tawy\" written on the side of the head of the cat - with a plaque containing the cartouche of this king. The plaques probably represent a statue of the goddess Hathor, \"Lady of Mefkat\", in the form of a cat."}
