The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds. The presence of filling ornament also suggests that the vases were mostly likely the earliest in the Grand Style. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. The depiction of male figures in this group is done in outline, as the male figure appears here. In later Grand Style vases male figures are depicted with coloured flesh. Finally, the attempt at creating some perspective is rather clumsy. Furthermore, Lemos identifies this sherd as a light chalice but the diametrer suggests that the vase was large and therefore most likely a heavy chalice"], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
