{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 46322", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "VASE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "23 cm", "Name": "Vase Support of Nehehy and Wife Senaa-ib", "Description": "This large round vase support was probably made to carry a libation vase. It was dedicated by the \"Priest of the Ka of the justified Senusert, named Nehehy, the justified, and his wife the Lady of the House, Senaa-ib, the justified, and venerated lady.\" The support is hollow and is made to carry a large vase. The rim of the artifact was once inscribed with incised relief giving the offering formula for the sake of the deceased couple. The figures sculpted around it show men and women, probably repeats of the dedicator and his wife, or members of his family. Male and female figures stand obediently between the upper and lower edges of the vase support, as if waiting to serve Senusert, for whom Nehehy acted as \"Priest of the Ka.\"The man is depicted with a shaven head and large ears, which followed the artistic canon of the Middle Kingdom. He wears a long kilt, knotted round his body and fixed by tabs. The woman wears the \"Hathor wig,\" which was worn by both members of the royal family and the common people. Their names and titles are incised beside the figures. The rendering of the features does not reveal good quality sculpture due to the figures' positions on the round support and the use of hard stone."}
