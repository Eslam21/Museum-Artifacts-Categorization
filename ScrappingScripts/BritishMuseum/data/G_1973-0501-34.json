{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.34"], "Description": [" Terracotta ithyphallic figure of Harpocrates. A seated, naked and ithyphallic youth, his huge phallus rising higher than his shaven head, to rest against his left side; he holds it near its root with his right hand. The left hand is not visible, but was probably placed on his thigh. What he is sitting on is not shown, and there is very summary treatment at the back. The plinth has broken away together with the figure\u2019s feet. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a thick grey core.

A number from the same or very similar mould series have been found at Naukratis (British Museum GR1973,0501.34; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.113.1914, E.125.1914 and E.126.1914; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, nos 1896\u20131908, E.4764-5 and E.4763; Coulson et al. 1996: 140, fig. 53:9 dated \u2018Hellenistic\u2019). A similar, but not this mould series, plaster mould is in Alexandria Greco-Roman Museum from a private collection (Seif el-Din 1988, 197, fig. 56 dated to the Roman period). Very similar limestone figure was found at the nearby site of Kom Firin in a mixed slump deposit including Late Period, Hellenistic and Roman pottery, in a primarily late 6th to 5th century BC area (Spencer forthcoming, F274, Trench NA context 0405). Note the Fitzwilliam E.1914 sequence were attributed to \u2018Antinoopolis?\u2019 and the British Museum GR1973,0501 sequence were found unregistered, but that both sequences include numerous terracottas now known to be found and/ or produced at Naukratis of types that predate the founding of Antinoopolis.
