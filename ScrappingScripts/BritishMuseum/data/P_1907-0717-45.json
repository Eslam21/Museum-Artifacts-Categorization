In this drawing the female figure sitting on the left leans her left foot on two cushions on the floor. This motive is repeated in nos. 1907-7-17-48 (figure at r) and 52 (at r). The position of the raised leg leaning not on cushions, but stone stools, appears further in nos. 1907-7-17-42 (at l), 43 at r, 46 at l, 47 at l, 49 at l, 53-57 at l, 60 at l. In the present drawing (no. 1907-7-17-45) the position of the saint is slightly shifted onto the right, leaving an empty space in front of his feet. Emphasis is given to the objects the devils are offering to the saint - as well as in nos. 1907-7-17-42, 44, 52 (although in this one there seems to be also a reference to the saint being assaulted, as the figure at the far right seems to be about to strike him), 57, 59, 62 and 63 - rather than to the physical torments that they will inflict. The saint is seated on the floor (actually on a stone that raises him up slightly) with a book open on his knees next to a wooden table. Wooden tables appear also in nos. 1907-7-17-13, 44, 57 and 67. One of the figures is crowned as in the drawings listed under no. 1907-7-17-42. 1907-7-17-1 to 90 is a so-called sketchbook, dismembered after its acquisition in 1907.
