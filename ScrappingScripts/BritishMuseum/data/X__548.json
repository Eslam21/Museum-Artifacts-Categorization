", " Reclining female limestone plaques are crudely carved rectangular limestone relief plaques of a reclining nude female figure, often with one or two small children, with a square-cut wig to the shoulders. They are often called \u2018concubines\u2019. Red and black painted decoration depicting jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets are also common on these. Many examples from Naukratis (Coulson 1996, 139-145, pl. XVII-4; Petrie 1886, 40, pl.19. 7-9; Hogarth 1899, pl.14.1-5; Hogarth et al. 1905, 127; see also comments by Gutch in Hogarth 1899, 82 nos. 49-56; Amsterdam 7948; Alexandria 16866, 16865, 16864; Cambridge E.191.1899, E.192a.1899; AN1896-1908-G.1008, AN1896-1908-G.1035, AN1896-1908-G.1034, , AN1896-1908-G.1032, AN1896-1908-G.1031, AN1896-1908-G.1030, AN1896-1908-G.1029,; Bolton 1966.88.A, 1966.89.A; British Museum EA 1886,0401.1506, 1886,0401.1506, 1886,0401.1504, 1886,0401.1510, 1886,0401.1511, 1888,0601.21, 1886,0401.1512; Cairo JE33574, JE33575; Heidelberg ST54; Coulson 1996, 142-3, pl.17.4, no.18, see nos. 19 and 21). Hogarth states these were common and popular in the sixth century BC (Hogarth 1905, 129, pl.19.4). Gutch regarded these (and terracottas copies) as offerings of women before or after childbirth, but dated them them late on the basis of being found near the surface (Gutch in Hogarth 1899, 82 nos. 49- 56, quoting Petrie 1886, 40). They were commonly found at Naukratis in the town (Petrie 1886, 22, 36, 40-1, pl.19.2, 7-9, Level 420 dated \u2018late 5th century BC\u2019). Parallels from Memphis (Anthes 1959, pl.30, b.48, variant type 1.1c; Petrie Museum UC 8650-3; UC8648 dated 26th Dynasty), Kom Firin (Petrie 1884-5 notebook), Sais (Wilson pers. comm. see also Daressy 1901, 230-239) Hermopolis Magna (El-Ashmunein, Spencer 1989, 51, pl.80, 79, no.111; Spencer, Bailey and Davis 1984, 100, Figs 12.3 and 12.8) and unprovenanced (Petrie Museum UC8649, UC8651, L-F.1.2 variants UC860, UC8653; see also UC8652). These examples date from the late 7th to the 6th, possibly into the late 5th century BC. Anthes, R. 1959. Mit Rahineh 1955, Philadelphia. Coulson, W. D. E. 1996, The Finds, in Coulson, W. D. E.
