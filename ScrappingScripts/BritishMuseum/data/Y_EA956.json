{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA956"], "Description": [" Black granite head from a fragmentary statue of a royal or divine female figure, the body and base now missing. The figure wears a striated wig which is set low on the forehead and tucked behind the ears. The right side of the wig is broken off just below the ear while the left side is broken off at the neck area, though the wig likely extended to the chest. Along the centre of the wig above the forehead is the coiled body and hooded frame of the uraeus cobra, with its head now lost. The face is fleshy with narrow eyes and ong cosmetic lines extending to the temples. The mouth is wide and sharply incised along the bottom lip, with the outer corners visibly turned upwards to form a clear smile. In addition to the breaks at the neck and wig, there are large cracks visible across the centre of the head with the left side damage extending across the face. The left side of the nose is now lost, and there are subsequent cracks and small chips to the right side of the face across the cheeks, chin, and lips.

The initial descriptions of the statue head included the provenance as Sais (early records detailed in Reeves 1989), however other suggestions have included Thebes (Budge 1922), and later sources preferred to assign the object as being of \u2018unknown provenance\u2019 (Bryan 1991). This has also been complicated by alternate hypotheses which date the head to the Third Intermediate Period as an archaising piece that deliberately harkens back to the New Kingdom style (James and Davies 1983; Seipel 1992).
