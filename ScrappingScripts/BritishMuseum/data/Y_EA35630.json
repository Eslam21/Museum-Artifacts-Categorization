He was presumably appointed deputy by his father some time after the latter became foreman in Years 1-5 of Sety II and possibly after Year 6 of Sety II when other deputies are attested. Aapehty appears as a deputy on one other monument, an offering-table. He is shown worshipping Meresger, while in a parallel scene his father, the chief workman Paneb, adores Amun-Ra. Inscribed on the offering-table are the prenomina of all the legitimately recognised rulers of the Eighteenth Dynasty, with the apparent omission of Tuthmose II, and the Nineteenth Dynasty up to Sety II, whose name appears on the sides of the spout of the table. Thus Aapehty may have been named deputy prior to the death of Sety II. He was presumably removed from office at the same time as his father. Bibliography: J. Burton.
