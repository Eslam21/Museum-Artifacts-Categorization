{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1389"], "Description": [" Grey limestone figure, probably of a man, painted. The figure, probably male, is seated on a low stool with a box on its lap which it is holding as if about to open it outwards. In front of the figure a table with four fish is standing. The figure's head is missing, so is the left front edge of the table; the right side above the stool is unfinished. The figure is sitting, legs apart, on a stool with four legs which are connected by horizontal baulks. At the back there are traces of detail in the drapery; the figure is wearing a chiton with a broad girdle and kolpoi hanging off the sides. The shoulders are broad, the upper body cup-shaped. Between its forearms the figure is holding a flat box with a lid on the knees whose hinges are visible; the fingers are curved around the front edges of the box. Four flat fish are lying on a three-legged table in front of the figure. A character may be incised on the front of the table. Traces of red paint are visible on the fish, the left forearm, the box and the stool.

There is no example of a fish-selling figure in Cypriot art, though it is possible to interpret the figure as someone sacrificing fish - a rarely mentioned paractice in Greece but quite common in Egypt though not in depictions. Dating depends on physique-related parallels with nude kouroi like the Cnidian kouroi in Amsterdam and London B320 and the nude youths with bent right arm London B 441 and 442 which date to 590 BC - 570 BC, while the seated statue of Chares from Didyma is dated around 570/560 or slightly later.
