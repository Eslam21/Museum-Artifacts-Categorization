{"artifact_name": "pendant", "Object Type": ["pendant"], "Museum number": ["EA29499"], "Description": [" Gold pendant showing Harpocrates: the group is intact, but has lost the chain from which it was suspended. The base of the group has bent slightly, and there are minor scratches on the surface. The loop for suspension has been soldered on to the back of the figure, and then a small cap of gold placed over the solder. The figure was probably cast, but then finer details achieved by hammering when the metal was cold, best seen on the back of the legs of Harpocrates. The boy god stands in the traditional posture, with one of the fingers of his right hand in his mouth. He wears an Egyptian feather crown, and holds an unwieldy cornucopia in his left hand, so heavy that he rests it on a tree trunk. He wears a large sash around his body. There is a dog at right side. Unusually, Harpocrates is shown with wings, a feature that suggests that this is an example of conflation between the Greek god Eros and the Egyptian Harpocrates.
