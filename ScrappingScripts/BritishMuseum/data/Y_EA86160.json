{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86160"], "Description": [" Very fine scarab, made of glazed steatite, parts on back and site chipped of. Fine details carved, whitish-beige colour with incised lines filled with dark turquoise to green glaze. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line. The prothorax and elytra itself show a decoration. In the upper part two parallel horizontal bands filled with small squares can be seen, the lower of them probably represents the division between prothorax and elytra. Underneath them on the elytra a lotus flower, no suture visible. The head is shown with two surrounding lines, both eyes indicated by very small incised lines, not glazed though. The clypeus is indicated by a simple line at each side as well. The side of the scarab shows two circumferential lines leaving a band as stylised legs. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, inside three erected cobras facing to the right, the two right ones show a more detailed carved shield. The cobra on the left looks like a seated goddess with a cobra head. Three signs like simple kA-signs above their heads. The longitudinal perforation is fully preserved.
