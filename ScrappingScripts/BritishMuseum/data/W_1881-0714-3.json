There are parallels on two other bowls (BM 91780 and one in the Schoyen collection), and the reported dream should now be re-interpreted as a magical motif rather than an actual dream. The reference to the expulsion of the demon is similar to that for divorces in Akkadian marriage contracts and is a motif which recurs on many Jewish Aramaic and other Mandaic incantation bowls where the demon is ordered to accept a bill of divorce, hence the reference to 'marital property', 'cash box', 'dowry' and 'mlug' property on the present text. The text is therefore another good example for illustrating how Babylonian traditions and vocabulary survived into the late Sasanian period, and how everyday and legal practices are being translated into the world of powerful household magic. Ford's edition of this bowl supercedes those of Segal and Muller-Kessler and discusses these points in detail.
