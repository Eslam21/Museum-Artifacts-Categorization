{"artifact_name": "stool", "Object Type": ["stool"], "Museum number": ["EA2472"], "Description": [" Ebony stool: the finest surviving example of its type, this stool combines precious materials and successful design with superlative craftsmanship. The leather seat dips in a double cove to give contoured support to the body from any of its four sides. Ivory inlay imitating garlands of lotus petals adorns the upper portions of the legs, contrasting brightly with the rich, dark tone of the ebony. Below the lotus garlands are miniature squares of ivory imitating through joints. The supporting lattice bracing, composed of two inner vertical struts on each side, flanked by two angled struts, is also of ivory. Stretchers of ebony terminating in ivory ferrules, which fan out in imitation of a papyrus umbel, hold the legs firmly in place. The legs taper toward the bottom and then flare out again to form a delicate, aesthetically balanced support. Incised rings ornament the tapered half.
