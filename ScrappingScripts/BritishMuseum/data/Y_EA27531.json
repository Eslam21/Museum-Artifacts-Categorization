Petrie mentioned among the finds a \u2018small pottery hawk, gilt\u2019. The cache can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). Falcons are often associated with Horus, though various deities and the pharaoh himself can assume a falcon form (Davies, Smith 2005, 54); the identification of the deity represented is even harder in the case of amulets (Andrews 1994, 27-28; on various types of falcon amulets: Herrmann et al. 2010, 103-104). Numerous amulets of falcon, made out of bronze, glazed composition, stone and Egyptian blue, were discovered in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). This finely detailed piece is unusual in the corpus of amulets from Naukratis. Falcon deity with a double crown could be a representation of Horus of Pe whose cult is well known in Sais.
