It was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Italy and Punic sites and in south Russia (Gorton 1996, 109-111, type XXX, subtype A19-31, see especially A23 for this piece). The hieroglyphs in the \"half cartouche\", as seen in many similar examples, are often interpreted as a debased version of pharaohs' names, and, in that case, Gorton suggested the inscription could stand more precisely for Wa-ib-re, the Horus name of Pammetichus I or the name of Apries (Gorton 1996, 110). Variants of this type were discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. 37, no. 71-73). Similar motif on Paris, Louvre Museum E8056 bis.9 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.695.
