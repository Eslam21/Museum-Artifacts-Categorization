{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA63833"], "Description": [" Head from the granite statue of a royal figure, likely representing the 25th Dynasty king Shabako. The king wears the traditional nemes headcloth and composite atef-crown placed on top, both of which are striped with alternating bands of rough and polished stone. The rough areas would originally have been gilded, though this feature has since been removed and likely reused. At the centre of the nemes are the remains of a broad double uraeus, a stylistic trait often adopted by the Kushite kings. There is evidence of reworking and smoothing of the stone in this area, suggesting that there was a later attempt to rework them into one single uraeus. The face appears broad and fleshy, with narrowed eyes and heavy upper eyelids. There is a subtle ridge of flesh on each cheek beside the wide nose, known as the Kushite fold, and the outer corners of the small mouth are upturned to suggest a slight smile. On the reverse, the top of a back pillar is also visible with traces of a column of hieroglyphic text that includes a royal epithet. The edges of the nemes headcloth have broken off on either side and would typically have reached past the shoulders. The sun disc from the king\u2019s crown is also now lost, and there is substantial damage to the remaining crown and the face of the statue, with chips particularly visible at the uraei and on either side of the atef-crown.

Kushite kings adopted well-established Egyptian artistic practices including the use of royal regalia, while incorporating their own traditions and styles particularly in the renderings of their face and iconography such as the double uraeus. Other surviving depictions of the king Shabako bear a resemblance to this statue head (some now held in the Louvre and Munich are discussed further in: Russmann 1968, 1974). It is thought that this head was subsequently usurped by the later ruler Psamtek II (Russmann 2001), who is known to have frequently repurposed the images of the earlier Kushite kings, including merging the two uraei into one and erasing the names of the former kings. Though there is no recorded provenance for the statue head, suggestions have included a possible context at Heliopolis based on the now lost sun disk on top of the crown (Russmann 2001), however Shabako is known to have also been active at Karnak and Medinet Habu with building projects and temple enhancements, as well as surviving reliefs across Egypt of the king which were located in sites such as Abydos, Memphis, and Esna.
