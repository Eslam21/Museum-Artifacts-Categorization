{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1784"], "Description": [" Sandstone stela of viceroy Hori: large, round-topped stela divided into two distinct sections with figures in sunk relief and incised texts. At the top Ramses III stands on the right, offering to Amen-Re\u2018, a goddess, presumably Bastet, and Horus. Three lines of text give the date and the full titulary of the king. The lower section of the stela consists of four columns of text on the right containing a prayer by the viceroy of Kush Hori. The viceroy and his deputy kneel in adoration on the left. Below, a single line of text names the deputy, Paser. The stela is heavily worn, and much of the surface has been lost, especially at the top.
