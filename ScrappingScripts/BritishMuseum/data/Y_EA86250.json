{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86250"], "Description": [" Relatively small complete scarab, made of glazed steatite. Beige steatite and remains of a light blue glaze. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line. Prothorax and elytra are divided with a single line as well, as is the suture. The humeral callosities are shown with an incised triangle. Prothorax and elytra show both an outer second framing line at the side and bottom part on both sides. The head has an trapezoidal shape. The clypeus is shown with three notches dividing it into four lobes, the plates are visible as well. The side shows one circumferential line that divides the scarab and its base plate. The line is bending upwards at the sides towards the middle of the body of the scarab. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. On the right a lying sphinx with wings and beard, facing to the right, with an enigmatic headdress (can this be the joint of a mn-sign with the head?). In front of the sphinx an ankh-sign. The orientation of the seal is transversal, while the perforation runs longitudinal.
