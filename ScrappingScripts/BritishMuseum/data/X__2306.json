", " This sacred musical instrument was particularly associated to the cult of Egyptian goddesses, notably Hathor, Isis, Bastet or Sekhmet (on sistra, see esp.: Hickmann 1949, p. 76-103, pl. XLV-LXX ; Pinch 1993, p. 143-146 ; Ziegler 1979, p. 31-62 ; Ziegler 1984). Naukratis provided several examples of sistra, in copper alloy like for this specimen, but also in glazed composition. Some of them can be dated to the 26th dynasty, supporting the practice of Egyptian cult activities in this period (Yoyotte 1994-95, 674; Masson forthcoming).
