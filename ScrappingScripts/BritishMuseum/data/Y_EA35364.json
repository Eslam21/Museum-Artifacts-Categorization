{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA35363"], "Description": [" Black basalt female figure on a slim rectangular base. She wears a simple Hathor wig set low on the forehead and tucked behind the oversized ears. Her eyes are extremely wide and almond shaped, with a long broad nose that is around the same width as the mouth. The lips are sharply incised, her face is broad and particularly rounded at the jawline and neck. She is shown standing with both elongated arms held by her sides. She wears a long tight-fitting sheath dress that reaches to the ankles, and her waist is extremely narrow. Her feet are extremely broad. On the reverse is a broad back-pillar with the top portion uninscribed and slimmer than the lower section. From the mid-section down to the figure's base, a single column of crudely carved text is inscribed across the surface. At the top of the base in front of the figure\u2019s feet is an additional short inscription, and a further horizontal band of text is incised around the left side edge of the statue base. There are chips to the front left edge of the statue base, and several notable cracks across the figure at the lower body, wig, and left side of the face. A further chip has damaged part of the left side arm and back and the edge of the left hand.
