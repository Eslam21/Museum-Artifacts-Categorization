This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " In addition to glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids, the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 at Naukratis was also producing amulets (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming; see also Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Petrie listed a number of different amulet-moulds (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 12-17), but not of this peculiar type which is unique in the corpus of moulds. See as a parallel BM 1920,0612.84 (lower part of menat-counterpoise; inscribed with a column of hieroglyphs including the cartouche of Apries; standing female deity holding a papyriform (wadj) sceptre). No amulet produced with this mould was recovered at the site. Furthermore, this object does not appear in the original EEF distribution list for Boston. A similar problem appears for the amulet-mould Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45971. It is therefore very unlikely that these two amulet-moulds were originally discovered in Naukratis. Gorton, A.
