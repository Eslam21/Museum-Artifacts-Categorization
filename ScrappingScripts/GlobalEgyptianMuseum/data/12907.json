{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "18054", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "16.6 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a statue of Amenhotep", "Description": "A fragment of a statuette of a squatting scribe. On the back pillar there are the lower parts of two vertical columns of hieroglyphs (inscription A); the base was encircled by inscriptions B (at the proper left) and C (at the right), of which only the last signs on the lateral surfaces and those on the back surface are preserved. The shapes of the hieroglyphs are Ptolemaic, the record of Djamut, a part of the Theban necropolis, makes the provenance of the statuette from Thebes most probable."}
