Although the iconography is typically Egyptian - the double crown, uraeus, and back pillar -, the head does exhibit a number of Greek influences. The swollen face of the pharaoh is characterised by pronounced eyelids and eyebrow arches, and a rather thin mouth. It is impossible to identify the king represented."}
