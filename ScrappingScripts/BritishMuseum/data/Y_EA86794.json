{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86794"], "Description": [" Almost complete seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The rear shows one side with very clear impressions of two smaller rows of basketry coil and another side with one larger row of basketry coil, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and the lid of a basket. The upper side bears an impression of a quite large oval scarab-like seal and many finger impressions covering parts of the seal-impression. The motif shows a round sign, maybe a sun-disc and right of it possibly a scorpion, only body and tail are preserved, underneath a winged scarab, all surrounded by a circumferential line. Same motif as EA86798.
