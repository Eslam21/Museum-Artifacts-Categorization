On both of the long sides, four antelopes with forward curving horns and short down turned tails stand on an uneven ground line, facing right. The animals have been identified as gazelles, and specifically as Kobs by Osborne and Osbornova. Above and below the animals are a number of irregular s-motifs and groups of horizontal lines that make a jog in the middle, the so-called the broken line motif, which may represent some type of light architecture or fencing. On one short side is a boat with many oars, and two central cabins joined by a short line. The frond on the prow of the boat unusually curves to the left. Above the boat is another broken line motif. On the other short side are six fish with fins indicated by strokes, their bodies filled with chevrons. The fish have been identified as Tilapia. They are arranged around a circle which may represent a mass of fertilized eggs, which the fish are taking into their mouths to brood. The young, raised in the mouth, later emerged from there appearing as if the fish had self-generated. This mouth brooding behaviour was later equated by the Ancient Egyptians with the myth of the god Atum, who used his spit to create the world, and so was associated with the concept of rebirth. Compared to more standardized Decorated ware of the predynastic period, the Irregularity in the some of the decoration, particularly the boat and the s-motifs has led some to question the authenticity of the decoration.
