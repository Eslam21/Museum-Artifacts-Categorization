{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of woman (probably Isis-Nike, possibly Harpocrates) riding a stallion rearing to the right, its forelegs off the ground. Only the lower section survives; most of rider missing. The horse apparently has no harness. The group stands on simple base. Only the front section is moulded, the back is plain, with vent in back and on base. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Matt red-brown slip on the front, with areas of a white dressing also on the front, particularly on the deity\u2019s clothing and horses hooves. The horse is red. Brown Nile silt with red core and abundant fine mica and sparse white inclusions.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Two close parallels known from Naukratis (British Museum GR1888,0601.114; 1888,0601.115 ) dated to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC (Bailey 2008, 3010.3011). Fabric is identical to examples found at Naukratis Site 95, the terracottas workshop, so probably locally produced. Horseman on rearing horse is derived from the dramatic 4th century BC triumphant Macedonian horsemen pose (see terracotta figure example from Cairo, Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 223, no. 91) and adopted for other subjects, usually gods, in the 3rd century BC in Egyptian terracottas, such as the similar late 2nd to 1st century BC Bes on horseback (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, 37, No.19). This pose continued into the Roman period, though in more stylised form, for example Harpocrates on horseback (Fjeldhagen 1995, 46, no.22). Bailey suggests this is a representation of Isis-Nike, though the absence of wings, suggests this may instead be Isis-Aphrodite. However the missing section makes conclusive identification impossible. Bayer-Niemeier, E. 1988. Liebieghaus Museum Alter Plastik. Bildwerke der Sammlung Kaufmann, 1.
