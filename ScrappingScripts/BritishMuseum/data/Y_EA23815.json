{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA23815"], "Description": [" Part of a limestone slab, probably from a trial-piece, with regular grids of slighlty different scale incised on both of the flat faces (squares of 2,05 to 2,1 cm on one face, 1,77 cm on the other face). One side of the object is preserved, showing a narrow border between the grid and the chamfered edges. The border is wider on the face of the grid of larger scale. On the other face, near a broken edge, one line perpendicular to the border has been doubled (interval of 1,5 mm between the two parallel incisions). It is probably a further fragment of EA 23814 (1887,0101.840) but does not present any joint with it.
