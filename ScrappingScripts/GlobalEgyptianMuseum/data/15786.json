{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 99122", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "PECTORAL", "Material": "QUARTZITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Pectoral of Aperia", "Description": "This pectoral, made of schist, was found in the tomb of the vizier Aperia at Saqqara. The two halves of this pectoral were found in two successive seasons of excavations. Originally, the object was suspended from the neck of Aperia's mummy by means of two holes at its edges, which are adorned with two falcon heads. The recto, or front, of the pectoral displays a line of text. This incised inscription on the top of the pectoral gives the name and titles of its owner. The pectoral was decorated with a scarab, which is now lost. The rest of the face of the pectoral is decorated with geometrical and floral motifs. The verso, or back, of the pectoral displays the text of Chapter 30 of the Book of the Dead. This chapter warns of the danger of letting the mummified heart testify against the actions of the deceased in the realm of the dead."}
