Over her shoulder is a Shawl that hangs down below her bosom. Her hair is shoulder length and is combed upwards, except for a curling lock that is partly hanging onto her shoulder. The artist was able to wonderfully create the hairstyle, the transparent clothes and the details of the breast. He sculpted the face in the traditional manner, expressing the protruding eyes, the somehow large nose, and the small mouth. The statue represents the Alexandrian woman with her hairstyle and the way she was normally dressed."}
