The excavator described the tomb as follows: 'Both the sides and bottom of the grave had been lined with wood 1 1/2 inches thick. Three vases had stood outside the woodwork, and two lay within, but the skeleton had been carried off. A roof consisting of a coarse mat over which had been spread a layer of mud, the whole probably resting on branches, had been laid on a level with the tops of the vases'. The wooden lining indicates that the tomb was that of a person of high status within the local community."}
