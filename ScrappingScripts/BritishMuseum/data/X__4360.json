This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The scarab belongs to Gorton type XII, a type especially well-distributed on Punic sites, but present also in Greece, Cyprus and in Naukratis in Egypt (Gorton 1996, 34-38, type XII, see especially no. 8b for this specimen). According to the examples discovered in good contexts, this type is attested from around 800 BC till 700 BC (Gorton 1996, 37). It could be an early scarab brought to Naukratis or, less likely, a locally produced imitation of this earlier type. For another example of this type from Naukratis, see BM 1888,0601.62.
