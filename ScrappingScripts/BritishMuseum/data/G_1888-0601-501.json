Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Naukratis Painter. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios. The Decorated Styles (p. 111, p. 275, no. 727, pl.
