The Princess sits on Bergami's knee, her arm round his shoulder, while he caresses her lasciviously. They sit with their back to an ass which brays: \"Oh Tempora!!\" She is very d\u00e9collet\u00e9e and wears trousers, and a feathered cap. A large miniature of Bergami, see No. 13858, dangles from her neck. Beside them on the ground is a basket of bottles, and overturned spirit-bottle and glass. A small boy, Willy Austin, stands staring at the pair, and blowing soap-bubbles. On the left, but disregarded, is Mahomet (see No. 14119) performing a dance with flexed knees; he holds up a crescent and a piece of drapery, looking towards the pair to say: \"in his signis Vincetes!!,\" parodying the words of Constantine's vision of the Cross. In the middle distance, beside a second ass, also braying, Louise Demont sits on the knee of 'the Jewish harper', see No. 13856, the harp beside them.
