{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6941A", "Dating": "27TH DYNASTY AND CONTEMPORARIES", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SEAL IMPRESSION", "Material": "POTTERY; CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Height": "3 cm", "Width": "3.8 cm", "Name": "Seal of Henat", "Description": "This imprint of a seal in clay bears an inscription arranged in two horizontal rows. It is composed of the name, the titulary and the ancestry of the owner. It is the \"Prophet of Menkaure, Chief ritualist priest, Henat, son of Psamtek-sa-Neith\". This person and his family are known by a number of documents. Henat was probably a contemporary of the Persian kings. His main title of \"Prophet of Menkaure\" demonstrates the existence of a funerary cult of King Mycerinus in the Persian Period. The imprint, which is in a very good state of preservation (compare E.6941B), was employed for tying rolls of papyrus."}
