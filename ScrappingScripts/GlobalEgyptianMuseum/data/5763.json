{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "89", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP III/AMENOPHIS III/NEBMAATRE ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; CARVED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "69 cm", "Width": "54.4 cm", "Depth": "12 cm", "Name": "Stela of Meriptah", "Description": "In addition to the usual stela with a rounded top, the rectangular stela type also occurs as a rare variant. This type has a cavetto cornice and a torus moulding together with elevated surfaces inside the frame, which create the appearance of a sacred building or a gate. The present monument was erected by the officer Meriptah for himself and for his father Tjena. The upper register carries depictions of Osiris and the jackal god Wepwawet (on the right), who are offered flowers by the father (left) and the son. At Abydos, Wepwawet was the son of Osiris. In accordance with the rules of Egyptian art, the gods have been depicted seated next to each other and looking straight ahead. The offering bearers stand on the opposite side. Over the scene is the solar disk with vulture's wings, symbolizing the heavens, flanked by udjat-eyes. The distribution of the figures in the relief follows a pattern which was common for mortuary stelae from the 18th Dynasty onwards. The upper part shows the adoration of the gods by the tomb owner and the other registers contain the provision of the deceased by the surviving members of the family in a funerary offering. Meriptah and his wife apparently had no son because the offerings on the stela are being presented by the deceased's brother, who is shown pouring water over the food offerings on the table in front of the pair. His garments are those of the sem-priest, who plays the role of the eldest son in the mortuary cult."}
