{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68825"], "Description": [" Piece of limestone which has been crudely carved, possibly intended to represent a human figure. The limestone has been worked into a stylised shape with rough indications of a head, arms, and legs, with a narrowing at the waist. The head area has an additional semi-circular shaped layer of limestone with further detailed markings, which could possibly be intended to represent a headdress. The reverse is flattened down, while the obverse bulges out slightly. There appear to be small traces of white paint across the surface on both sides. The figure has several chips around the edges of the figure on both the left and right side, and a large chip to the left side of the head. There are also visible scratches to the \u2018chest\u2019 area and legs of the figure.

These figures are relatively rare at Naukratis and highly variable in form, with a selection of other prisoner figures now held in various museum collections (see list in Thomas 2015). \u2018Rude stone figures\u2019 were recognised by Petrie to be a local, early production, dating to the 6th \u2013 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886); these have since been dated more specifically to c. 620 \u2013 400 BC (Thomas 2015, also provides a further list of comparable examples from sites including Saqqara, Tell Dafana, and Herakleion). A possible female prisoner figure from Naukratis made from terracotta is now held in the Museum of Classical Archaeology (Cambridge, NA494). The provenance for this figure is recorded as the sanctuary of Apollo at Naukratis alongside two other votive objects also within the British Museum collection (EA 68823 (1886,0401.1489) and EA 68824 (1886,0401.1491)), however it\u2019s also noted that the location of these finds may be the result of a later \u2018disturbed context\u2019 (Thomas 2015: 12, n.72). Other possible captive figures from other contexts at Naukratis are included in the British Museum collection (such as EA 68820 (1886,0401.1485) and 2011, 2011.7). Further Bibliography: R.I.
