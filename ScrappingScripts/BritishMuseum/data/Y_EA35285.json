{"artifact_name": "coffin", "Object Type": ["coffin"], "Museum number": ["EA35285"], "Description": [" Wooden coffin of Nekhtankh: the inscriptions are the work of a careful scribe and illustrate the highest quality of hieroglyphic palaeography in the Middle Kingdom. Although the images and texts are quite sparse they reflect some of the important symbolic functions of the coffin. The most fundamental of these was the provision of new life and sustenance for the deceased. A pair of eyes is painted within a frame towards the end of one of the long sides. The long inscriptions on the sides of the coffin refer to this same basic necessity, for they contain the hetep-di-nesu formula, in which Osiris is invoked to supply offerings. Isis and Nephthys are mentioned at the foot and head-ends, respectively, and on the long sides the texts place Nekhtankh under the protection of Geb, Nut, Shu, Tefnut and the Four Sons of Horus.

The material of which the coffin was made influenced its cost and reflected the status of the owner. Cheaper coffins were made of woods native to Egypt, such as sycamore fig. For persons of higher rank coffins were carved from stone or assembled from planks of costly imported timbers such as cedar. In this instance, the owner Nekhtankh is not given any title in the inscriptions, but he was evidently a person of importance, as his coffin is made of cedar and has been decorated by skilled craftsmen. When the mummified body was placed inside the coffin it was carefully positioned on its left side, with the head supported by a headrest. The mummy's face was aligned with the eyes painted on the side of the coffin, and these operated magically to enable the dead person to see. By orientating the coffin in the tomb so that the side with the eyes faced east, the deceased could view the rising sun each dawn, symbolic of new life, and could also look towards the part of his tomb where offerings would be placed to sustain his spirit.
