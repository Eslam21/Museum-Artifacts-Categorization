{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA801"], "Description": [" Fragmentary calcite group statue, only two pairs of feet and a partial section of the statue base remaining. The group statue is broken off from the ankle of both figures, with fragments of stone behind the limbs also still intact. Both sets of feet are in close proximity to one another. There are no clear traces of clothing visible at the break of the ankles. There are small chips across the surface of both sets of feet, and the darkened surface of the stone suggests that the figure was subjected to an intense heat after its construction. The base has been reconstructed in modern times. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Old Kingdom (?) ", " Middle Kingdom (?)

Group statues were popular in both the Old and Middle Kingdom, and commonly depicted husbands and wives but also in other contexts other family members or relations. The placement of the feet close to one another may indicate that they shared a wide seat, or possibly that they were standing."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["incomplete - feet and parts on the plinth only"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA801"], "Registration number": [".801"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.801 (Birch Slip Number) "]}
