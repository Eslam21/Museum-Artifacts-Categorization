{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "E72:104", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BASALT", "Height": "21 cm", "Width": "5 cm", "Depth": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Figure of a man with shaven head", "Description": "Fine example of the small figures of men and women found in Middle Kingdom burials, a small version of the larger statues placed in temples. Before the New Kingdom it was rare for the king to grant permission for a statue of a subject to be placed in a temple. Although this statuette doubtless comes from a tomb, it adopts two marks of purity and piety appropriate to temple areas, the shaven head and the position of the arms outstretched over the kilt with palms downturned. The robe tied at the waist and covering the knees is typical of the period."}
