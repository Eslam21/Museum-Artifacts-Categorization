{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.145"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of engraved rock art on two boulders, on two boulders, showing the pecked figures of two giraffes, a cow, an ostrich and two unidentified quadruped animals, all upright. The boulder in the foreground hosts five of the figures with the leftmost a giraffe facing right. The animal appears as if agitated with tail up and arched down and a spiky mane clearly visible on the crest of its outstretched neck. There are two gaps in the infill pecking within the animal\u2019s trunk and strange backward projections from its front fetlocks. The other giraffe figure stands opposing it and facing left, with tail extended but longer legs and no mane. To the right of this stands the cow figure, facing left with pecked vertical bars forming a schematic coat pattern marking on its body. The cow has u-shaped horns and above it is an unidentified pecked line shape, perhaps representing the unfinished spine and head of another cow facing left. This is cut off the edge of the image on the right. On the boulder behind that in the foreground is a pecked, infilled ostrich, upright and looking right, cut off the edge of the image at the neck. . Between the two giraffes and on the background boulder are three unidentified, pecked and infilled animal figures. The leftmost has an extended neck (giraffe calf?) and faces right, the other faces towards it. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.

There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " cattle ", " bird "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi Hamra "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.145"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWHA0010017 (TARA number) "]}
