{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA9953,B1"], "Description": [" Funerary Papyrus of Khay: a part of the funerary papyrus of Khay, 'Chief Keeper of the Writings of the Lord of the Two Lands'. This section includes a treatise in Middle Egyptian now known as 'The King as Sun-priest'. As is usual for funerary papyri of this period, the text is written retrograde in cursive hieroglyphs, between borders, with painted vignettes. On this section the text is flanked by two fragmentary vignettes. The one on the left shows the deceased before an offering table, while the one on the right must originally have shown the object of his veneration. The remains of a sandy desert landscape suggest that the vignette showed sunrise, like vignettes to the solar hymns of the Book of the Dead.

As a royal archivist, Khay would have had access to archival copies of the text. The original treatise is a description of the king's role in the solar cult; here it is adapted to form a preface for Khay's hymn to Amun-Re as sun-god, and the start of the original text is heavily truncated. The royal version of this text in the temple of Luxor is accompanied by a scene of the king adoring the solar bark. Bibliography: A.W.
