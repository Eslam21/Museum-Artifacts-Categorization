Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). This scarab belongs to a type, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B90-96, see especially B90 for this piece; on the various productions of the \"Scarab Factory\", see also Webb forthcoming).
