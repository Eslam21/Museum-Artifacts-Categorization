{"artifact_name": "human mummy; mummy-wrapping", "Object Type": [" human mummy ", " mummy-wrapping "], "Museum number": ["EA54053"], "Description": [" Mummy of a young male child, name unknown, wrapped in coarse linen bandages, now discoloured. Skull - Head flexed. Mouth closed. Teeth unerupted and milk teeth present. There is a granular, solidified 'fluid level' in the occipital region. A circular hole, about an inch in diameter, is visible in the extreme vertex of the skull. This is not pathological and is almost certainly post-mortem, as what appears to be a fragment of bone corresponding to the size of the opening lies within the skull. Thorax and Abdomen - Apparently empty. Owing to the tightness of the wrapping, the left ribs have been dislocated at their vertebral articulations. The 2nd and 3rd left ribs have been fractured. There is gross displacement of one of the dorsal vertebrae, and also the body of dorsal 12. Arms - Extended. Hands with extended fingers, their palmar surfaces in contact with the outer aspect of the thighs. Legs - Within normal limits. No fractures, dislocations, or lines of arrested growth.
