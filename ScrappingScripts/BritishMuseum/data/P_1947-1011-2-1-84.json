{"artifact_name": "christmas-card; print; photographic print; drawing", "Object Type": [" christmas-card ", " print ", " photographic print ", " drawing "], "Museum number": ["1947,1011.2.1-84"], "Description": [" Ring-binder album containing 85 Christmas and other cards, family photographs and drawing given to Queen Mary; bound in blue leather and leatherette, with gold tooling; stamped in gold inside the spine: \u2018The \u201cOriel\u201d Binder / Rd. No. 93024 / Marcus Ward & Co. Ld.\u2019, paper label on spine inscr.: \u20181891 to 1910\u2019 (in fact the dates extend more widely). Album comprises 34 pages of gilt-edged card with blue window mounts, with one to four cards per page (see layout markings); on verso, hand-cut openings reveal inscriptions on backs of cards. The cards are described on an undated note in the hand of Queen Mary (QM) pasted to the inside of the front board: \u2018Autographed Christmas & / New Year cards given to King George V & Queen Mary. / by / Queen Victoria / King Edward / Alix Empress of Russia / Ella Gd Duchess Serge of Russia / Pss: Mary Adelaide Duchess of Teck / Francis Duke of Teck / Augusta Gd Duchess of Mecklenburg Strelitz / Frederick Gd Duke of Meck: Strelitz\u2019. Also on inside of front board two additional items, 1949,0411.5279 and 1949,0411.5280, gifts from QM in 1949; these are catalogued separately. The arrangement of cards is only roughly chronological: the album starts with group of cards from Queen Victoria [QV], dating from1881 to 1899, followed by sets from QM\u2019s relatives mixed with those of Prince George [KGV]. Correspondents\u2019 names have been identified by signature or by QM\u2019s later notes on the album page. For a number of cards, stuck down and lacking notes by QM, the correspondents will not be known. The cards are mainly commercially-produced items for Christmas and New Year; mostly English with a few made in Germany, America, Italy, Norway and India. The album also contains around a dozen handmade items, including botanical drawings sent by Queen Victoria. Of the 85 items 14 are not Christmas material. Towards the end of the album the cards incorporate more photographic elements such as family snapshots, studio portraits and foreign postcards.
