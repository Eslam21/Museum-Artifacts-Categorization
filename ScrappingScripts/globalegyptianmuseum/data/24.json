{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "ACO.Tx.0316", "Dating": "COPTIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "COPTIC TEXTILE", "Material": "FLAX; WOOL", "Technique": "WOVEN; UNSPECIFIED", "Height": "18.5 cm", "Width": "15.5 cm", "Name": "Roundel", "Description": "This roundel consists of a border decorated on the interior with plant motifs and on the exterior by broken polychrome lines, and a central scene depicting two people with nimbuses. The man on the right is sitting on a throne holding a stringed instrument on his knees. The second figure seems to be approaching the first, with the right hand raised as if in greeting. The interpretation of the scene is not clear. Perhaps it is King David playing the lyre accompanied by the personification of the muse \"Melodia\", or maybe this scene belongs to a cycle of episodes about David's youth. "}
