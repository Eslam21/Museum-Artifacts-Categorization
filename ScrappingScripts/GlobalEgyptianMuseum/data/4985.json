It was only used in a funerary context. It should be interpreted as being connected with regeneration. The amulet served to raise the head of the deceased, just as the rising of the sun means rebirth and renewal for the deceased. The place where the amulet was laid on the mummy is known: near the neck in the bandages. They are usually made of a dark stone, most often haematite."}
