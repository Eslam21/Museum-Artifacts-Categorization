Since then, scholars have assigned it a later date. It is very similar in technique, particularly in the lightly hatched parallel shading drawn with rapid fluency in D\u00fcrer's drawing, ' Rest on the Flight into Egypt' of 1511 in Berlin, (KdZ 3866; see 'D\u00fcrer and his Legacy' 2002, no. 112). The subject and style are also very close to D\u00fcrer's 'Passion' prints which he published the same year, particularly the frontispiece for the 'Large Passion' series of woodcuts, 'Christ as Man of Sorrows mocked by a soldier' (Meder 113) and the 'Man of Sorrows standing by a column' of 1509 which he produced for the 'Engraved Passion', (Meder 3).
