{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5826", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY (not before); 20TH DYNASTY (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; LOW RELIEF; ENGRAVED", "Height": "39.4 cm", "Width": "30.2 cm", "Depth": "6 cm", "Name": "Relief fragment", "Description": "Relief fragment depicting a striding man and a woman. The man is holding a long staff in his right hand, a napkin in his left. His dress consists of a pleated shirt and a short heavily pleated kilt. The woman is wearing a long close-fitting garment and has her right hand on her chest. On her head is an ointment cone. The inscription seems to make no sense and lists several titles. The scene is bordered on each sides by vertical lines. Perhaps this piece comes from a corridor, although this would be without parallel for this period. "}
