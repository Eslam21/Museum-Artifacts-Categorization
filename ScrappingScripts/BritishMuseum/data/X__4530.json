", " The inscription gives clearly the name of Amun-Ra (not men-ka-Ra, as suggested by Gorton, 104, B141). Numerous variants of the name of Amun-Ra were discovered on scarabs and scaraboids in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 89-93; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 25 and 36), without including all the different cryptographic writings of Amun on Naukratis scarabs and scaraboids. This scaraboid belongs to a type produced at Naukratis and widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, Type XXVIII B, subtype B140-147, see especially B141 for this piece; on the various productions of the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, see Webb forthcoming).
