The apotropaic composition with the group 'Bes-crocodile-hand' belongs to a well attested category of scarabs and scaraboids (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 124-126, no. 698-699; Jaeger 1982, 88 \u00a7 383, 213 \u00a7 1393). The crocodile is replaced in several examples by an oval inscribed with the name of Menkheperra (Jaeger 1982, 88 \u00a7 383d). Jaeger listed several occurrences of this design on convex rectangular plaques dating to the Ramesside Period (Jaeger 1982, 232 \u00a7 1455) and suggested that the specimen from Naukratis, as well as other stone scarabs, scaraboids and plaques which depict Bes, should probably be dated to this period too (Jaeger 1982, 205 \u00a7 1366, n. 868). Though Naukratis scarabs could be archaizing copies of Ramesside types, it is possible that they are genuine Ramesside ones (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see Masson forthcoming).
