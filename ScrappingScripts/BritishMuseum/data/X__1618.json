", " From the Hellenion precinct (14), under wall of 2nd temple, a 5th century BC deposit (Gutch in Hogarth et. al. 1899, 83, pl. 12. no. 67). Found with NA359 (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology). Two parallels from Naukratis of the same type and possibly from the same mould series (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA385; NA389). East Greek protome bust (also known as a \u2018shoulder-bust\u2019) of a Classical Greek type (broadly 480BC-400BC). The fabric and style is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC to 400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, Type B2, pl.147-8) and in the British Museum from Rhodes, dated late 5th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 295, GR1885, 1213.41). Similar pieces, not from the same mould, were found at Olynthus dated to the 5th century BC (Robinson 1952, pl.12, no.19; pl. 36, no.83; pl.38, nos 98 and 100).
