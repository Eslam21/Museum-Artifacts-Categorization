{"artifact_name": "flask", "Object Type": ["flask"], "Museum number": ["EA37588"], "Description": [" A pottery flask, perhaps a bath-flask, in the form of a head of a black African, cut off at the neck. The mouth of the vessel is low, with a plain moulded rim, and a single pierced handle is at the rear. The African's hair is curly and short, and recedes at the temples; he has a frowning brow, and the eyes are well-defined with the pupils marked. The mouth is open, showing the upper teeth and the tongue; a narrow hole is pierced through the mouth to the interior of the flask. The right side of the head is damaged. Two-piece mould; a separately made floor is applied to the neck. Micaceous (very small particles) light-brown Nile silt; a dark-grey core shows at a break in the neck, but not elsewhere. Pink paint within the man\u2019s mouth.
