At the top is a single line of text giving a shortened offering-formula which is continued in a further line beneath the three panels containing representations. The central panel has figures of Sennu and his wife Tjentets seated on either side of an offering-table above which their names and titles are inscribed. The panels on the left and right have scenes of relatives making offerings: on the left, his son \u1e24m-k\u0292 (unless this is a title) brings strips of cloth, and 'In\u1ec9-\u2018n\u1e2b, possibly another son, brings a jug in a bowl and a duck; on the right, his son Pt\u1e25-\u0161pss is shown offering incense, and his daughter (?) Nfrt brings a duck. The lower part of the stela has larger figures of Sennu and Tjentets on either side of the doorway and there are smaller scenes on the outer jambs: on the left from bottom to top, Nb-\u1e25\u1e0fw (?) is shown bringing a haunch, his daughter \u0292bdwt bringing a duck, and his daughter Nfrt-s\u1e0fmt standing in attendance. On the right, at the bottom, \u1e2anw, possibly a son, is shown filling a pot; in the middle five jars of oil are shown; at the top is a representation of his daughter \u1e2anwt, bringing a duck.
