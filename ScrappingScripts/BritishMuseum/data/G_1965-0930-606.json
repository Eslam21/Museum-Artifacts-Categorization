Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. The sherd belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1965,0930.607."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.699) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.606"]}
