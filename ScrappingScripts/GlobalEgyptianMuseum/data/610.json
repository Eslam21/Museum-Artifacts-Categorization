The eyes are shut; the large nose is flattened; the mouth presents no details. The holes in the middle of the large ears are very particular: they were pierced too high to be able to hold ear-rings. The hole in the left part of the neck is also exceptional; its function is not known. The front part of the head is entirely flattened."}
