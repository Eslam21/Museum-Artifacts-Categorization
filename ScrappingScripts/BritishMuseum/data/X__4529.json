", " Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is either a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) or an abbreviated form for the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 165). This scaraboid belongs to a type, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B58-61). The hieroglyphs depicted on the underside can be found on several scarabs and scaraboids of various shapes discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl.
