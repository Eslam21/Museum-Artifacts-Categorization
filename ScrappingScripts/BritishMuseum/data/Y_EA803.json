In front of the mummy there was a table of offerings, the upper part of which can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner. Above it are arrayed the following objects connected with the ceremony: two 'nms.t' vases, four 'd\u0161r.t' vases, three (?) adzes, the 'wr-\u1e25k\u0292w' instrument, another vase, a chisel, a finger, a 'ps\u0161-kf' amulet, the fore-leg of an ox (?), a feather, two censers (?) and a scribe's casket (?).
