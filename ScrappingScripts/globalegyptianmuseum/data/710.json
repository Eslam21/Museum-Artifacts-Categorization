Beginning in the Roman Period, the portrait of the deceased was painted on wooden panels, which were then inserted into the mummy bandages; they replaced the traditional mummy mask. The portraits were made in encaustic, that is, wax mixed with pigments. Originally a Greek technique, this Roman tradition became very popular among the Egyptians from the 2nd century AD onwards. The Brussels portrait shows a young man with a somewhat melancholy look, wearing a white 'himation' (garment without sleeves)."}
