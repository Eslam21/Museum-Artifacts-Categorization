This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to the Egypt Exploration Fund list, the Redpath Museum received in 1887 several \"paste objects\" from the Scarab Factory, along with two moulds. This amulet might come from such a context. Large amuletic figures of Sekhmet, or other lion-headed goddesses, were perhaps produced in Naukratis. A terracotta mould to cast such figure was discovered in the Scarab Factory (according to Museum records): Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45970. As connoted with her headdress, the goddess is associated with the solar cult. In the Late Period, lion goddesses could be identified as an emanation of Amun-Ra. In the Delta, the main cult centres for lion goddesses are Bubastis and the Memphite region.
