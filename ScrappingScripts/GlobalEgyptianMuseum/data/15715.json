{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 38517", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "COMB", "Material": "BONE; WOOD", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; ENGRAVED", "Width": "10.5 cm", "Name": "Double Comb with Lion Decoration", "Description": "The double-sided comb of meticulous and elegant workmanship has a square tablet framing a lion. The lion has been cut out of the same piece as the tablet. The lion holds the frame with its head, four paws, and end of the tail. This frame consists of a bone ruler with inclined stripes inlaid on the four sides. The same decoration is on the other side. The two vertical sides of the frame extend upward and downward on the comb to form the two ends of the teeth. The teeth are cut out in the shape of winglets reproducing vaguely the profile of an Egyptian cavetto cornice, or frieze. The two vertical sides are reinforced by a counter pillar protruding from each side of the comb. Thick teeth formed the upper part of the comb. They originally comprised 17 strong but elongated and highly compact teeth at one-millimeter intervals. The small side has 10 very fine teeth, with nine intervals per centimeter."}
