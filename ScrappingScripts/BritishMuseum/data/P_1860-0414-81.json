According to the register these came from the collection of William Russell. Carpenter proposed making a selection of those that the BM lacked; this was first declined by Colnaghi's, but was later accepted (see his later report dated 11 April). The final selection of 255 prints cost 300 guineas. Nos.312 to 327 were Japanese colour prints - almost the earliest to enter the BM collection."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1860,0414.81"]}
