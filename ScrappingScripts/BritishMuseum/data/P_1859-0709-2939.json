These volumes were broken up at the time, and integrated with '21 prints by the Wierix' listed on 28 January 1859. The total of 291 prints more or less matches the run registered as 1859,0709.2939 to 3232 (294 prints).

They may be traceable in a London auction of the period."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1859,0709.2939"]}
