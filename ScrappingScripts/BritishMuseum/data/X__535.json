", " Likely to have been found in the southwestern corner of the Hellenion, close to well 35: \"The first point at which any considerable find of inscriptions was made, was at 34, where in the corner of a small chamber abutting west on the great enclosure wall, which runs north, a number of dedications to the Dioscuri were discovered about 2 ft. above the mud. Just south of the southern wall of this small chamber and at a similar level occurred the lamp with Dioscuri dedication (No. 57); and south again of this, up to the line of the E.-W. enclosure wall, were found (scattered partly on the surface in sebakh-diggers' and rubbish heaps, partly a foot or two above the mud) a few dedications to Herakles (Nos. 33, 84), mixed with stray sherds of Apollo (No. 52), Artemis? (No. 65), and others not to be identified, including the inscribed stone horse (No. 58), which like two other horses found by the sebakh-diggers close to this same point, lay in untouched earth almost immediately upon the mud.\" (Hogarth et al. 1898-9, p. 30). \"But the Bedawi boys who searched the rubbish heaps farther west on their own account (north and west of the well 35) brought us at one time or another many inscribed fragments of fifth, fourth and third century vessels dedicated to Aphrodite (No. 87), to \"Gods of the Hellenes\" (Nos. 76, 71, 77, 8o, 78, 75, 8I), and (one only) to Poseidon (?) (No. 62). The last named, it is worth noting, came from almost the same spot as the stone horses mentioned above (close to well 35).\" (p. 31) ", " Many examples of these limestone horsemen have been found at Naukratis (Heidelberg, Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t, ST48; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1850; Cairo, Egyptian Museum JE36257, JE33573.2; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, AN1896-1908-G.1013, AN1896-1908-G.1007, AN1896-1908-G.109, AN1896-1908-G.1041, AN1896-1908-G.1040, AN1896-1908-G.1039, Bolton Museum 1966.90.A; British Museum 1886,0401.1486, 1886,0401.1487, 1886, 0401.1766; Cambridge MCA NA306, see also variants: Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-G.1027; British Museum 1886,0401.1493, 1965,0930.952, 1965,0930.949). The diminutive figure on horseback is a common representation on Late Period and early Ptolemaic figures, and may represent Harpocrates on horseback as is clearly the case with later examples based on distinctive features. This rider is too crudely carved to be certain that a child is represented. Late variants of this are sometimes depicted ithyphallic, consistent with representation of Harpocrates of the 4th century BC. Petrie dated most of these pieces to the 6th to 4th century BC. Four examples, including two with Greek dedications (inscriptions dated c. 450BC -350BC Johnston pers. comm.), were found next to the Hellenion in untouched earth, in the lowest 2 feet of deposits, containing 'early Naukratite pottery' (Edgar in Hogarth et al. 1905, 30, 39, 55, Pl.14.10 and 11, wall [35], i.e. Chian pottery of late 7th to 6th century BC date). Other artefacts from these earliest deposits include Late Archaic, but mostly Classical period pottery and terracottas of the end of the 6th and the 5th centuries BC. Two examples were found in a well deposit of the 5th century BC (Hogarth 1905, 122; Hogarth Diary 24-25/04/1905, well 2 bottom), and another with a 5th century BC bronzes hoard in Petrie\u2019s so called \u2018Ptolemaic building\u2019 at the south of the town (Petrie 1886, 30, 40, pl.19.5, see also 46, objects now re-dated c.480-400BC). Parallels known from Buto (Cairo Museum TR14/1/34/8), Tell Dafana (Petrie 1888, 71, dated 7th century BC; Edgar in Hogarth 1905, 129, dated 6th century BC), Saqqara (Quibbel 1907, 13), and Sais (Wilson pers. comm.). Form changes in the early 4th century BC when they change (Saqq\u00e2ra). Type dated between c.600 or 550 BC to c. 350 BC, with the majority likely coming from 27th Dynasty contexts. Petrie, W.M.
