They were purchased by A W Franks and given to the BM in June 1883. The slip for the first item gives the initials RSP as the source of the collection. This must stand for Reginald Stuart Poole, Lane's nephew, who was Keeper of the Department of Coins and Medals at the BM from 1870 to 1893 and acted as his uncle's literary executor.
