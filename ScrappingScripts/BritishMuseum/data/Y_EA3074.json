{"artifact_name": "collar", "Object Type": ["collar"], "Museum number": ["EA3074"], "Description": [" Part of a gold collar: the collar consisted of a series of rows of gold beads, attached to terminals in the shape of open lotus flowers. Each row was composed of beads of different shape, mainly imitating plant forms. There are folded leaves, papyrus flowers on stems, mandrake fruits alone and with leaves, flower buds, lotus seed-vessels and closed buds of the lotus. The terminal and beads are excellent examples of the cloisonn\u00e9 work, which was one of the favourite techniques of Egyptian goldsmiths. Most of the inlays have fallen out, but the tiny traces of cornelian and blue glass give a faint hint at the rich impression which the collar would have created in its pristine state. Openwork.
