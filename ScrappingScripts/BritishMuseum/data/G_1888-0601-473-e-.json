The rim pattern on the sherd is not typical for the Wild Goat Style, but is common in the Simple Animal Style. Furthermore, the interior decoration on the sherd is not typical of the Wild Goat Style. Goats are not usually found in styles later than the Wild Goat Style, yet perhaps this is an exception. Similarly, boars die out with the Mature Animal Style, though one later example exists, see 1888,0601.467."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
