{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["1977,1011.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta: coarse ware basket vessel. A pot with a basket-handle, modelled as a floral group: below a heavily moulded rim, are elements of a wreath, including, on both sides, two large bulbous objects that may possibly represent the ivy berries often found on wreaths, below which is a group of small berries or perhaps grapes, and on each side the tips of vine leaves. Two-piece mould with an applied handle over the mouth. Brown Nile silt with some mica and a red core; much of the surface has fired a buff colour. A very few traces of an overall white dressing survive.
