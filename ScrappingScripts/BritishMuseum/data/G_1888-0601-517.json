The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis; the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white; rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. According to Williams, it possibly shows the blinding of Polyphemos. For possible parallels, see Williams 1983, 160. The number 500 is written in pencil on the interior. Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5.
