", " Though damaged and fragmentary, this faience object clearly belongs to the group of mixed-style amulets representing naked male figures (Webb 1978 Chap. 7, nos. 277-347; Webb forthcoming). Several specimens were discovered in Naukratis, especially in the sanctuary of Apollo (Petrie 1886, pl. II). It is not illustrated, but is close to no. 8). What appears to be a loincloth is actually the remains of a large area of black-brown additional glaze used to mark the pubic hairs. As with other figurines from Naukratis and elsewhere, the application of the dark glaze lies above the actual sexual organs. The use of a main glaze in light turquoise does not preclude this being a product of the same group of workshops.
