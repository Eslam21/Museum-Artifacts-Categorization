{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3876", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL; PAINTED", "Height": "12.5 cm", "Width": "9 cm", "Name": "Sitting orant", "Description": "This figurine of terracotta depicts a seated woman, her arms raised. She is dressed in a pleated tunic. Two rows of small curls surround the face, and on the back, the hair is separated by a middle parting and drawn into plaits on the nape of the neck. The ears are pierced for earrings. The woman seems to also wear rings on the arms and a chain around the neck. The piece belongs to the type of figurines representing an orant seated on a chair. This latter element, which is not preserved here, shows that these orants are to be situated predominantly in the domestic cult and that their gesture is the expression of prayer in the widest sense of the word (compare E. 3873)."}
