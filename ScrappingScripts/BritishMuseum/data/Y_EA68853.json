{"artifact_name": "figure; amulet", "Object Type": [" figure ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA68853"], "Description": [" Mould-made amulet of a seated falcon-headed lion figure, the lower legs and base now lost. The figure is depicted with a falcon head and two large round eyes indicated on either side of the short beak, with traces of brown-black paint particularly notable on the right-side eye. Above the front legs of the figure the chest projects outwards, and traces of the original glaze are visible on this area. The front legs of the figure have been carved separately and sit parallel to one another, while the hind legs are still conveyed as one complete block. A thick suspension loop on the figure\u2019s back is pierced widthways. The remaining traces of the glaze are visible across the surface, with varying colours of faded white to light brown. In addition to the break at the front legs, the lower legs and base of the figure is now lost. There is evidence of salt efflorescence across the surface, and a notable chip to the top of the suspension loop on the reverse.

Amulets of hieracosphinx figures were produced during the New Kingdom and the Saite period, and such figures are associated with Montu, a hieracocephale warrior deity from the Theban region, or to Khonsu, the falcon-headed lunar god (Andrews 1994). The latter was particularly revered in Naukratis as the son of Amun and Mut. A range of falcon figures in amuletic form were also found at Naukratis (Masson 2015: 61-63). This object was analysed in March 2014 by the Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Mus\u00e9es de France (C2RMF). Using proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE) under a 3 MeV energy proton beam, the object was inspected to characterise its elemental chemical composition (major, minor and trace elements).
