{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA36298"], "Description": [" Fragmentary greywacke figure of Senusret III, the lower body and base now missing. The king wears the nemes headcloth with the material tucked behind the oversized ears and long striped lappets reaching to his chest. The horizontal band of the nemes is set low on the forehead with a uraeus cobra positioned in the centre, now headdless, and its coiled body extending across the top of the headcloth. His eyes are narrow with drooping eyelids, and arched eyebrows which also slope down at the outer edges. There is a suggestion of sunken skin underneath the eyes and on either side of the broad nose. The lower portion of his face is now damaged around the nose and mouth. His face appears fleshy particularly around the jawline. His upper body is bare with subtle modelling of the chest and abdomen. He wears a necklace composed of different sized beading, with an amulet in the centre. His arms are held by his sides, and the angle of his remaining left arm suggests that his elbow was bent, with his forearm likely held out before him. In addition to the loss of the lower body, both arms and sections of the torso are damaged. There are small chips visible across the stone surface at the face, the outer edges of the wig, and around the chest area. The object is now supported by a modern mount.

"], "Materials": ["graywacke"], "Technique": ["incised"], "Dimensions": [" Height: 23 centimetres (max) ", " Weight: 3.83 kilograms ", " Width: 14 centimetres ", " Depth: 11.50 centimetres "], "Curator's comments": ["Stylistic traits of this fragmentary royal figure such as the oversized ears and recognisable facial features identify this figure as king Senusret III, of whom over a hundred surviving statues are known (earlier identifications of the figure included Amenemhat II; Budge 1922). Many surviving representations of Senusret III also include the adornment of a necklace, in contrast to earlier rulers who were rarely depicted wearing jewellery other than the typical broad-collar and bracelets (Haney 2020). The amulet necklace worn by this figure is unusual in its shape and has been posited to be a double pouch pierced by a thorn or equated with earlier Old Kingdom amulets (Polz 1995; Russmann 2001). Despite the loss of the lower body, it is likely that Senusret was originally depicted in a seated position, based on the bent angle of the left arm suggesting that his palms were placed on his legs in the traditional seated pose. A fragmentary seated statue from Elephantine has been proposed to potentially join this piece (detailed in Russmann 2001; Vandenbeusch et al 2016). Further Bibliography: H. R. Hall, 1930.
