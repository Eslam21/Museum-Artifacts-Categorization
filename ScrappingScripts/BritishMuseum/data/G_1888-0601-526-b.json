The fragments of the B7.4 cup show a wing and snakes, a combination that makes possible the suggestion that the subject was Typhon, although the work is too fragmentary to allow certain identification. There are some obscure points as well: wings are not a common feature for a sea-daemon. From the little that is left of B7.4, however, a reconstruction is almost impossible, so the question of form and identity must be left open. See Pipili, M., Laconian Iconography of the Sixth Century BC. Oxford 1987, 69.
