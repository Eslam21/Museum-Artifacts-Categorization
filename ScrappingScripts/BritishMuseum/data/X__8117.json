", " Square and rectangular weights are commonly found in Egypt and appear rather conspicuously in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. XXIII). They were manufactured in a large range of material, more often in all sorts of hard stones, but bronze and lead examples are also quite numerous (Cour-Marty 1990, 26-27, fig. 9-10, fig. 13). Bronze cuboid specimens, such as this example, were particularly popular during the Iron Age II and Persian period in the Levant (for example, they represent a third of the corpus of weights discovered in 7th century BC contexts in Ashkelon: Birney and Levine 2011, 474; see also examples of the 9th century BC from \u1e24orvat Rosh Zayit: Kletter 1994). See numerous references to this type of weights quoted by Birney and Levine (in 2011, 474) showing that it particularly ranges from the 9th till the 4th century BC. These weights in Naukratis, therefore, should probably be dated to the late 7th-4th century BC. Birney, K.J. and Levine, E. 2011, \u2018Balance Weights\u2019, in L.E. Stager, J.D. Schloen and D.M.
