{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 91468", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "24.6 cm", "Name": "Standing Statue of an Ichneumon", "Description": "Many bronze figurines of ichneumons, or mongooses, have survived, and most of them date to the Late Period or Ptolemaic period. This statue is one that shows the ichneumon standing and raising its hands; it has human hands instead of paws. Its skill in killing snakes led to the myth that the sun god, Re, once took the form of an ichneumon in order to fight Apophis, the great serpent of the Underworld. This solar identification is responsible for the sun disk on top of the head of this statue. It also wears a uraeus, or royal cobra, accompanying the sun disk, which serves to identify the ichneumon with Wadjet, the goddess of Lower Egypt."}
