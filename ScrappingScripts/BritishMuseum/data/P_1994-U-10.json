A painter from Birmingham, Stanier seems to have first travelled to Spain and North Africa between 1863-66. Returning from his travels, he created large watercolours with views of foreign scenery that captivated the imagination of his contemporaries. While the sites of the ancient civilizations of Egypt had been studied by archaeologists since the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was only during the second half of the century that the area became more easily accessible. As a result of strengthened political ties between the British and Ottoman Empires, British tourism in Egypt increased steadily during that time and allowed wealthy travellers and artists to visit sites such as Karnak and Thebes. New guide books, for example the \u2018Handbook for Travellers in Egypt\u2019 (1847) by the distinguished Egyptologist Sir John Gardner Wilkinson, became available and prepared the travellers from the West for their journey. These books included suggested itineraries that led the visitors to all the important sites while educating them about their historical and cultural significance. Works like those of Stanier also played an important role in this growing tourism industry. Although their production context is not certain, they may well have been painted for patrons with an interest in the advancing field of Egyptology or for those who may even have visited the sites themselves and in exhibitions they would attract potential tourists. One of these patrons was the Birmingham collector John Hollingsworth, whose sale at Christie\u2019s on 3 May, 1867, included not only a large collection of works by David Cox, but also \u2018four important drawings of Egyptian subjects by H. Stanier\u2019 (see the advertisement of the sale in the Daily News, April 29, 1867, issue 6547, p. 8). Further research is needed to ascertain precisely which drawings were included in the sale and where and when Hollingsworth acquired them. As the present drawing of Karnak is signed and dated 1868, it could not have been in Hollingsworth\u2019s sale of 1867. However, it most likely originated from the same series of Egyptian views that Stanier painted in 1866 and parts of which may have entered Hollingsworth\u2019s collection before his sale in 1867. The present drawing shows the Great Hypostyle Hall at the temple complex of Karnak, built around 1290-1224 BC (19th Dynasty) and located in the modern day town of El-Karnak. The work is characterized by a swift and loose handling of the brush and a luminous palette that captures a shimmering atmosphere. It was exactly this \u2018free and dashing\u2019 brushwork as well as his \u2018decided feeling for colour\u2019 that was lauded by Stanier\u2019s contemporaries (see obituary Birmingham Daily Post, January 27, 1894, issue 11110).
