", " This type of lamp would usually have had a wider nozzle than what was reconstructed in plaster. Similar volute decoration on this form of lamp is commonly found on late 2nd century to 1st century BC lamps, though it is less pronounced (Bailey 1975, Q594-600). Macclesfield West Park Museum no longer has a provenance for this piece, a Naukratis provenance is ascribed based on the EEF distribution list description, fabric and form of the lamp. ", " According to the distribution list of the Egypt Exploration Fund, Macclesfield also received a silver tetradrachm and a bronze coin of Ptolemy V, 204-181 BC; these have not yet been located.
