{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA812"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Penmennefer: there are two registers on this round-topped stela decorated with scenes in sunk relief and incised texts. In the upper register the ram-headed Amen-Re\u2018 is enthroned on the right on one side of an altar heaped with offerings. The goddess Werethekau in the form of a serpent is entwined around a lotus flower on the left side of the altar. Behind her a small 'was'-sceptre carries a large floral bouquet in its arms. In the lower register eight columns of text contain a prayer to Amen-Re\u2018 and Werethekau on behalf of the guardian of the Place of Truth Pennefru. The stela is badly gouged in several places on the surface which has gone brown. There are traces of red paint in the lines between the columns of text and on the serpent, the flowers and the body and feathers of the headdress of Amen-Re\u2018, while black paint is visible on the horns of the god. There is a black nodule of flint embedded in the area where the throne of Amen-Re\u2018 is delineated.

Certainly the stela exhibits other peculiarities such as the inverted lod in the first reference to Amun in the first column of the second register.
