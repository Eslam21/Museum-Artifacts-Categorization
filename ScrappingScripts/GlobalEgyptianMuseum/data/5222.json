{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "62", "Dating": "30TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE; DIORITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "61.1 cm", "Width": "14.5 cm", "Depth": "25.7 cm", "Name": "Naophorous statue of Gemnefhorbak", "Description": "A kneeling man is presenting a small chapel which houses the statue of a goddess. This is a type of temple statue known as \"naophorous\". The man appears to be naked, without any jewellery or amulets. His hair is bag-shaped in the characteristic fashion of Late Period statuary. His delicate features are another sign of the times. The face is not individualized nor realistic, but renders the contemporary ideal type. The individual traits are present chiefly in the inscriptions. The goddess inside the chapel- a nude female figure with only the Lower Egyptian crown on her head, is Neith, the goddess of the city of Sais."}
