However, the decoration on the cul of Chalice Style vases typically consists of simple bands; broken maeander patterns and rising rays do not feature on Chalice Style vases. They are, however, commonly found on the earlier Wild Goat Style chalices. Furthermore, whilst some Chalice Style vases do lack interior decoration, it is the norm on Wild Goat Style vessels. For parallels, see the W\u00fcrzburg chalices (Lemos no. 236-237)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
