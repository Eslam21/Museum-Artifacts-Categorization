{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1908:514", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Height": "40 cm", "Width": "23 cm", "Depth": "30 cm", "Name": "Statue of Rey", "Description": "The lower part, without the feet, of a standing figure of a man wearing an elaborate pleated garment with fringe. The statue was excavated in the temple of Ptah at Memphis, and would have been placed in one of the outer courts. The standing pose is appropriate to temple sculpture, and the hieroglyphic inscription on the front contains the request for a share in the offerings placed on the altar of the god. It identifies the owner as the king's scribe and overseer of the Double (i.e. national) Granary, named Rey. His titles indicate that he was a leading courtier of the time, as confirmed by the high quality of the sculpture."}
