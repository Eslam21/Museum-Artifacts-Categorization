Palettes carved out of hard stone \u2013 variously described as diorite, porphyry, or granite \u2013 are more common in Nubia, where they have a long history, dating back to the 5th millennium BC Neolithic cultures. Amongst the Nubian A-Group, palettes were preferably carved out of quartz, but \u2018diorite\u2019 was also occasionally used. In Egypt, such hard stone palettes are extremely rare and the majority are without precise archaeological context. While some appear to date to the late predynastic or Early Dynastic period, several hardstone palettes have recently been found in graves of the Final Neolithic pastoralists at Gebel Ramleh, some bearing traces of red ochre. These are very similar in shape and are roughly contemporary with this palette. Published: Friedman et al.
