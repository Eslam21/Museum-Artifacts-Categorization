{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA14405"], "Description": [" Fragmentary green basalt kneeling figure, only the right leg and right side of the base now remaining. The figure wears a short kilt that extends to just above the knees. The lower legs and feet are bare, and he is shown kneeling with the feet flexed. There is a clean diagonal break from the right side upper leg through to the bottom of the base on the left side. On the reverse is a small section of a slim back-pillar with an incised column of text. On the right side corner of the base is a surviving section of a horizontal line of text that continues onto the front edge of the base. The majority of the base on the left side and reverse has also broken away, and there are numerous scratches to the surface across the right side leg and base.

Such naophorous figures bearing an image of a deity were particularly common within the Late Period. The figure is recorded as being found within the remains of the 20th Dynasty Ramses III palace at Tell el-Yahudiya, though this object was acquired by the Museum before the excavations at the site by both Naville and Petrie in the 1880s."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["incomplete - right leg and side of plinth only"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Rev Greville John Chester"], "Acquisition date": ["1871"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA14405"], "Registration number": ["1871,0619.459"]}
