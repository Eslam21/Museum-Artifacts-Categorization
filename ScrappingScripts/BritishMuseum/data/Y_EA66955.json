{"artifact_name": "plaque", "Object Type": ["plaque"], "Museum number": ["EA66955"], "Description": [" A rectangular label of ivory: with a hole for attachment at the top right-hand corner. On one side there is an incised design showing two standing figures, facing each other, with their arms extended downwards to hold an object of uncertain form. The better-preserved figure wears a beard, but it is not possible to be sure whether the other figure had this feature. Restored from two fragments and rather decayed on the surface.
