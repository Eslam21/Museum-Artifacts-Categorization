{"artifact_name": "bracelet; bead; spacer-bead", "Object Type": [" bracelet ", " bead ", " spacer-bead "], "Museum number": ["EA3082"], "Description": [" Bracelet: composed of six strings of stone beads threaded between five metal spacer-beads. The spacers are made in two halves, each half decorated with three horizontal and six vertical knobs, representing multiple beads. Four of the spacers are of electrum; one, which has seven divisions and is made from gilded silver, is probably modern. The beads are oblate, spherical, standard and long truncated convex bicones made from cornelian, amethyst, lapis lazuli, green feldspar and turquoise. The two large spherical beads, one at each end, are of green glazed quartz, although much of the glaze is now rubbed away.
