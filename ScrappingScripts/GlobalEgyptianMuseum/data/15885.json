{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 34562", "Dating": "MERENPTAH/BAENRE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Mummy of Merenptah", "Description": "King Merenptah was buried in tomb KV 8 in the Valley of the Kings and later moved to the tomb of Amenhotep the Second, where it was found. The skin of the mummy became unusually brighter, mainly due to the salt that was heavily used in the mummification process. His skin's brightness leads some scholars to link him with the Pharaoh of the Exodus in the Old Testament, who drowned in the Red Sea. However, nothing about this mummy supports this theory. The pharaoh apparently suffered from dental problems and fractures in his thighbones. In their search for gold, the tomb-robbers split the mummy's right clavicle and injured the left shoulder, possibly by using a knife or an axe to cut a hole through the body."}
