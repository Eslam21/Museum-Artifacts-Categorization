The designs are imitations of Chinese blue and white and combine Chinese-inspired foliate with more Islamic motifs such as geometrical designs and bulbous ewers. The Chinese motifs have been absorbed and transformed into a delightful hybrid Chinese-Islamic style. Several groups of such tiles are known, including those in situ in the mosque of Murad II in Edirne (north western Turkey)"], "Bibliographic references": ["Porter 1995 / Islamic Tiles (fig.85)"], "Location": ["On display (G42/dc6)"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Yanni Petsopoulos"], "Funder name": ["Funded by: Brooke Sewell Permanent Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1978"], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["1978,0419.1.m"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 21 Sep 2006"]}
