Head and body section only of a mould-made doll. Dancer wears polos and a short chiton, peculiar to dancers and young girls of that period. The missing arms may have carried castanets or tambourines as they do with other examples. Would have had separately articulated limbs, lost in antiquity. A string hole for attaching the arms runs between the shoulders. Broken at the abdomen where legs would have been attached in a similar way. A hole in the top of the head has an uncertain function. Pressed into a one-piece mould with a plain flat, roughly finished back. Traces of black paint on hair. Red-beige clay with beige core sandwiched between dark pink-red outer margins and beige surfaces. Common fine angular grey, white and red inclusions as well as vesicles.
