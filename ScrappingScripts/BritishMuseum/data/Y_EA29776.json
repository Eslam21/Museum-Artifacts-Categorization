{"artifact_name": "coffin; mummy-mask; mummy-cover; cartonnage; mummy-wrapping; human mummy", "Object Type": [" coffin ", " mummy-mask ", " mummy-cover ", " cartonnage ", " mummy-wrapping ", " human mummy "], "Museum number": ["EA29776"], "Description": [" Adult man in a wooden coffin bearing the name Djeho. The mummy has resin poured on its linen wrappings, a gilded cartonnage mummy-mask and ornaments including a collar, pectoral, apron and foot-cover. Skull - No obvious fractures apart from some damage in the nasal region suggesting that the brain was removed through this channel. There is a solidified mass of resin lying in the posterior part of the skull. Artificial eyes are within the orbits. These 'eyes' are somewhat different from the smaller elliptical 'eyes' found in Twenty-first Dynasty mummies, being rounded and a little larger. They are also much more dense. The mouth is slightly open, and all teeth are apparently present. The cervical spine appears intact. Thorax and Abdomen - Apart from resin, both cavities are apparently empty. The ribs, spinal column, and intervertebral discs appear intact. There is an opacity in the region of the left flank which probably represents a plug of either linen or resin in the embalming wound. Pelvis - A large ball of linen occupies the pelvic cavity. The bones of the pelvis and the hip joints appear normal and are free from fractures and dislocations. Arms - Crossed on the breast (right over left). The palms of the hands, fingers extended, rest on the shoulders. No fractures or dislocations seen. Legs - The bones and joints appear normal. No fractures, dislocations, or lines of arrested growth noted. The feet appear within normal limits. Wooden anthropoid inner coffin of Djeho, son of Psamtek: rare features include the liberal use of blue pigment and gilding, face and beard gilded, eyes painted, wig blue, elaborate polychrome painted collar, figure of Nut, with outstretched wings and flanked by wedjat-eyes, protects breast, vignette beneath shows the mummy of the deceased on a bier, with canopic jars below, flanked by figures of Isis and Nephthys in mourning, vertical registers of hieroglyphs below, flanked by columns of seated funerary deities, describe how Nut will protect the deceased, the spaces on the lid, between figures and vignettes, are filled with other funerary texts, papyri columns supporting uraei, crowned with solar discs, decorate the sides of the base.
