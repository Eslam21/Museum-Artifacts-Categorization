Her feet are on a footrest on the pedestal of the statue. She wears a long dress reaching her ankles. Her right hand is holding her breast, giving the impression that she will breast-feed her son Harpocrates who is sitting on her knee. The left hand of the goddess is holding the head of Harpocrates. This pose is the same as that used for the goddess Isis with her son Horus. It is a beautiful maternal scene. It is a classic scene in real life as well as in the art of Egypt. In the Christian Period, statues and reliefs of the Virgin Mary depict Mary with her Son Jesus in the same pose. That particular pose regarding Mary is unique to Egyptian art."}
