In the middle is a male figure, wearing a sidelock, short, curled wig and collar, with two female figures, his sisters, on either side. The female on the left wears a papyrus plant on her headdress, the one on the right carries a large sistrum. The scene depicts part of a procession during the Sed-festival of Ramesses II, with his eldest son here acting as the An-mutef priest, a practice recorded as taking place during such festivals throughout the pharaonic period."}
