Alabastra were first attested in ancient Egypt (from the 11th century BC) and were originally carved from alabaster. The tradition spread via ancient Greece to other parts of the classical world and were produced in pottery, glass and metal. A fragment excavated at Heid ibn Aqil may be from a similar vessel and can be dated to before the middle of the first century AD (Cleveland 1965, pp. 102, TC 904)."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Good"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: D B Doe, MBE"], "Acquisition date": ["1985"], "Acquisition notes": ["Collected in South Yemen between 1961-1967."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["1985,0223.127"]}
