The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). This specimen belongs to the type T 39 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 799-800, Taf. 51c, Typ T 39, esp. Nr. 1075 from Naukratis). Ichneumons are particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum, as well as with Horus of Letopolis (Weiss 2012, 308-309). Atum is particularly well-represented at Naukratis particularly in the category of votive box and especially in the shape of reptiles such as lizards and snakes (Masson forthcoming b). Two other bronzes representing ichneumons were discovered in Naukratis: figure of an ichneumon walking on small base, Boston Museum of Fine Arts 86.282; group-figure depicting two ichneumons, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.262.
