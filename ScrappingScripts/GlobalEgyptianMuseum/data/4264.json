A 'Kheker'-frieze divides the inscription from the writing. In the arch is a 'pt'-sign, on which are painted stars and below this is a winged sun-disk. Below these is a solar-bark in which are seated the deities Re-Harakhty, Isis, Nephthys and Atum. Their names are painted above them in a cursive script and they all have the Maat-feather on their knees.The main text reads from right to left and consists of the htp-dj-nsw formula, written in cursive script and unfortunately damaged in places. The outer border of the stela is made up of blocks of red, blue, pink and green, the colours are still quite bright. "}
