It seems that this statue originally belonged to a person named Hekenu and was taken by the woman after his death. She changed some of its features to make it more suitable for her. There were hieroglyphic inscriptions beside the legs of the woman and on the base but they were damaged. However, enough text remained to identify the original owner of the statue."}
