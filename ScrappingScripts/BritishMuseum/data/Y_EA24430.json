{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA24430"], "Description": [" Limestone stelophorous statue of an unnamed man: the deceased is represented kneeling on a pedestal and holding before him a stela. He wears a long braided wig, a short beard and a long skirt reaching to the ankles. The top of the stela is shaped in the form of an offering-table, some of the offerings being carved on the top of the support connecting the stele with the figure. In the arch are incised two 'wedjat'-eyes flanking a 'shen' sign, a cup and three lines of water. Below, incised in eight horizontal lines of Middle Egyptian, is a hymn to the sun-god (one of those now designated Spell 15 of the funerary Book of the Dead). The name of the owner has been erased, but otherwise both figure and stela are well preserved. Traces of red paint still remain on the body.

It may be possible to read the group more literally, as a wish for the deceased to 'see' (written with two eyes) the solar cycle and the water (see L. Coulon, 'V\u00e9ractit\u00e9 et rh\u00e9torique dans les autobiographies \u00e9gyptiennes de la premi\u00e8re P\u00e9riode Interm\u00e9diaire', \u2018Bulletin de l\u2019Institut Fran\u00e7ais d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale\u2019 97 (Cairo, 1997), 109-38). The dedicator's name has been erased, presumably because it contained the name of the god Amun, and was removed in the reign of Akhenaten as part of that king's religious reforms; the statue can be dated to the immediately preceding reign from its style. The statue was probably placed in the owner's tomb, possibly in a niche in a pyramidion above the tomb chapel, where it would face the rising sun. In earlier statues of this type, the text is is inscribed directly on the area between the worshipper's hands and on his kilt.
