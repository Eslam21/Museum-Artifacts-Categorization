{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "61", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE; DIORITE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "53 cm", "Width": "15.5 cm", "Depth": "33 cm", "Name": "Seated statue of Seni-ankh", "Description": "The name and title of Seni-ankh are given in the shallow incised inscription on either sides of the calves of his legs. He is seated on a chair with a low back with his hands placed flat on his thighs. He is wearing a smooth-surfaced wig which falls in two pointed ends over the shoulders. Together with the long kilt which is tied together on the chest, his appearance conveys the typical appearance of a high official from the Middle Kingdom. Another characteristic feature of this time is the individually rendered facial features. The statue's height corresponds quite closely to one royal cubit, which makes it one of the larger private sculptures of the Middle Kingdom."}
