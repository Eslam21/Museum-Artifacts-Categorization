{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:164", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "UDJAT-AMULET", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "GLAZED", "Width": "1 cm", "Depth": "0.5 cm", "Name": "Udjat-eye amulet", "Description": "Finely carved green-glazed steatite amulet in the form of the udjat-eye, symbol of well-being. The large eye, smaller lower markings, and relatively high relief cutting are typical of mid-18th Dynasty examples. On the underside is inscribed rather less well a hieroglyphic motto, perhaps to be read 'Amun is my creator'. Amun 'the hidden one' was the most popular expression for the creator-god, especially at Thebes, his cult-centre."}
