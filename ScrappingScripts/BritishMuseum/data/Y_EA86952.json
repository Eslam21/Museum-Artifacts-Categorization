{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86952"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows a slightly convex impression of a textile or leather object, probably a bag. Two impressions of a turned string with a width of about 0.2 cm. At the flat upper side the lower third of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible, the sides are bending downwards and show many finger impressions. The seal itself is only preserved in its lower half, showing a circumferential line and originally three registers, of which two are preserved. The same motif can be found on EA86690 and EA86951. Each shows a row of seated deities. The upper one starts left with a sA-sign, then Seth facing left and behind him a deity with a sun discand the moon crescent (Khonsu?). The second register shows another seateddeity with a beard, facing to the right, in front of it remains of a kheper in the middle. Then the second row shows a seated deity at the end of the second row, facing to the left. The third row shows two sA-signs at the outer parts and another sign (dj?) in the middle. This seal EA86952 has preserved parts of the lower right area of the seal.
