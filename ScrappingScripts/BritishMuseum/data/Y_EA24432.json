{"artifact_name": "jug", "Object Type": ["jug"], "Museum number": ["EA24432"], "Description": [" Serpentine jug: this is a large, well-made jug with a handle and separate lid (broken and repaired). It has a narrow base and a well-formed rim. Below the rim, where the top of the handle joins the neck, are two horizontal bands which are an extension of the handle and were presumably intended as a decorative feature, although they might conceivably also replicate the appearance of a cord-based handle from an earlier era.
