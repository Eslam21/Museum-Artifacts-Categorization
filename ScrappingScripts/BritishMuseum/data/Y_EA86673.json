{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86673"], "Description": [" Almost complete seal-impression with three rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side two further rows, showing that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica, charcoal and grog. The diameter of the basket can be estimated to about 12-13cm. The top part shows the impression of a scarab-like seal and quite some finger prints around the seal impression. The seal impression is very shallow and shows probably a bird in the middle, facing to the left, in front of it two hieroglyphs (maybe nfr or nTr) on top of two small signs, maybe nb-signs? Behind the bird maybe an uraeus. The clay was hardened after excavation.
