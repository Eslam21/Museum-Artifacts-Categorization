It shows an aggressive attitude against evil powers; the fangs are bared, the tongue protrudes from the mouth to tease, one foreleg is raised to ward off all evil forces while the other foreleg is placed on a hieroglyphic sign called \"sa\", which means \"protection.\" For this reason it is called a prophylactic (protector) lion.The unguent vase is the only burden on the head of the lion; it carries the vase in the same way as Egyptians peasants, who carry water jars on their heads. The vase is decorated with floral motifs and small squares decorated in blue and white pigments. The base of the statue is in the form of a rectangular stool decorated with geometric and floral motifs painted in white, blue, and yellow. This beautiful piece is cut from a single piece of alabaster; the tongue, the fangs, and the claws of the lion are ivory."}
