The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave opens on the inside with a curved back wall and a domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with a circular rear wall. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich.
