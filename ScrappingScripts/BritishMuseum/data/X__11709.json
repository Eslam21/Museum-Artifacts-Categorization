This horse-and-rider terracotta model has good parallels dating to the Cypro-Archaic II period (600-475BC), from Amathus (Murray, Smith & Walters 1900, 112, fig. 164.9; Karageorghis 1995, Type IIe(2) pl. 49.7), Salamis (Karageorghis 1995, 76-Type II(i)c11. pl. 38.8, Type II (i)c28. pl. 40.5, Type II(i)c66-8. pl. 45.1-3; Fourrier 2007, 25, pl.1.1). Horse-and-rider subject in Cyprus coincides with its appearance in the Near East and the Aegean in the Cypro-Geometric I-III period and clearly remained important until the Hellenistic period. The figurine workshop at Kourion almost exclusively made horse-and-rider figurines between the 7th and 1st centuries BC (Winter 1991, 221). This figurine is labelled in pencil T, designating this as coming from a context excavated by Petrie within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, during Gardner\u2019s excavations at Naukratis in 1885-1886.
