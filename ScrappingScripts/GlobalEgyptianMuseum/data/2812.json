It is uncertain whether this represents the ancient product, cartonnage - a material made from layers of linen or papyrus, plastered over to form a flexible surface for body-casings - or a modern concoction from ancient elements. The papyrus bears the painted figure of a jackal-headed mummiform god, to the left of columns of carefully outlined hieroglyphs, characteristic of the Book of the Dead in the late Ptolemaic Period."}
