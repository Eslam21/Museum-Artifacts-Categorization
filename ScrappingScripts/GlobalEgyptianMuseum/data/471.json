{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3044", "Dating": "HATSHEPSUT/MAATKARE", "Archaeological Site": "TEMPLE OF HATSHEPSUT ?", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "RELIEF; PAINTED", "Height": "44 cm", "Width": "33.3 cm", "Name": "Head of Hatshepsut", "Description": "This fragment of relief, which probably comes from the funerary temple of Deir el-Bahari, represents queen Hatshepsut dressed in an atef-crown. The presence of this divine crown demonstrates that the queen takes here the aspect of Amun-Re as that of male creator god. On the right, one notices the lower part of a cartouche which contains the name of Thuthmosis II, husband and predecessor of Hatshepsut, which proves that the relief has been hammered and then restored. On the piece several traces of colour remain."}
