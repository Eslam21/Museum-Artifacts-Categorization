This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " More than a hundred of votive boxes were discovered in Naukratis. The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). If its identification as a votive box is correct, this specimen surmounted by a figure of an ichneumon could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). Petrie indeed signalled one bronze box with an ichneumon (Petrie 1886, 41). One large figure of a standing ichneumon in copper alloy (BM1885,1101.83) was also found in the bronze cache of Naukratis. Ichneumons are particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum, as well as with Horus of Letopolis (Weiss 2012, 308-309). Atum is particularly well-represented at Naukratis particularly in the category of votive box and especially in the shape of reptiles such as lizards and snakes (Masson forthcoming b).
