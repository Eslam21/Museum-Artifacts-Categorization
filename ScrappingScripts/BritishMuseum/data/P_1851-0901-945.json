Bonaparte wears a huge cocked hat, is naked from the waist, but wears sleeve-ruffles, according to the old gibe on the beggarly French fop. He is much emaciated, and gashed with wounds; 'Nelson' is inscribed on his solar plexus. Blood gushes from his nose. Jack Tar's right leg stretches across central Europe, the toe supported on 'Malta'.
