"], "Description": [" Fragment of inscription with a probable dedication to Apollo or a boundary marker. Smooth front face with upper and left edges preserved. The bottom side is broken off, however, a six-letter inscription in eastern Ionic script is preserved in two rows and divided by engraved horizontal lines. On a third row below it is likely to be written: \u0391\u03a0\u039f / \u039b\u039b\u03a9 / [\u039d\u0399] or [\u039d\u039f\u03a3]. The letter forms are vertically aligned but not regularly spaces, and deeply incised. The letter heights are 2.3 \u2013 3.5 cm. The left side is eroded except for the smooth 2 cm wide band adjoining front the face side. The right side is badly eroded but preserving traces of letters in two rows are divided by an engraved horizontal line (possibly \u039c\u03a5\u039b / \u03a5 [\u2026]). The surface of the back is badly eroded. The origin of the marble may be Ionia.
