It resembles the thin ivory or stone bracelets worn in earlier periods. In the Old Kingdom such bracelets were worn, alone or in combination, on one or both arms. Altogether comparable examples dating from the Fourth Dynasty have been found at Mostagedda, in the tomb of a child buried with three ivory bracelets on the right arm and four on the left. Ivory hoops were common in the Old Kingdom, but bracelets were also made of bone, tortoiseshell, horn, calcite, and metal. Cf. ivory bangles in T. E. Peet & W. L S. Loat, \u2018The Cemeteries of Abydos, part III. 1912-13 (London, 1913), pl. VIII, from mastaba D144, Third to Fourth Dynasties.
