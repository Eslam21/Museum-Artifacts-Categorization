Neck, triple cable, surmounted by A, band of strokes alternately up and down; B, chevrons. Shoulder, lotus flowers and buds, unjoined: seven birds (on A the first has curly wings raised and a spiral plume; on B the first and third birds are of simpler type - of the sixth not enough remains to decide): dividing band of strokes alternately up and down. Belly, meander and square: (originally) ten or eleven animals, of which seven are goats and one a deer: hook meander: enclosed palmettes - once, where there is not space for a palmette, a volute is substituted: dividing band of strokes alternately up and down: lotus flowers and buds, unjoined (these buds have spikes, cf. the first bud on the left of the shoulder of B).
