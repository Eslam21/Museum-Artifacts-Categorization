{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1208.6"], "Description": [" Clay figure of Harpocrates(?). Harpokrates standing on a plain flat-faced plinth, supported by a pier on his left side. He wears a long chiton, perhaps over an undergarment, with a narrow fringed belt slanting down from his left to right, the long ends of which fall in front; a rolled himation curves down from his right shoulder to his left waist, with a loop at that side. His head is lost, but there are signs of long hair, and perhaps the lappet of a ribbon that bound a wreath rests on the left shoulder. His hand is to his mouth. He holds a Herakles-club in the crook of his left arm, and a falcon, wearing a Double Crown, stands on top of the pier, beside the club. The back is plain, with a roughly circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brick-red Nile silt, with sparse traces of a white dressing.
