{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA49534"], "Description": [" A head broken from the hollow terracotta figure of a dog, wearing a large floral wreath, with another garland or perhaps a collar round its neck. From a multiple-piece mould; certainly two, perhaps more. Red-brown Nile silt, brown at the core, and containing some mica and white inclusions. Overall fired-on white slip. Some of the painted detail may also be of fired-on ceramic colours: red on the collar/garland and on the dog's muzzle; eyes and brows are black, as also are areas on the large wreath. The pink that also decorates this wreath is probably a post-firing paint.
