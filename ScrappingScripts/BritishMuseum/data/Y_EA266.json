{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA266"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Djehutyhermaktef: round-topped stela divided into two sections decorated in sunk relief with incised texts. In the upper register the hawk-headed Re\u2018-Harakhty is seated in a solar barque together with a baboon representing Thoth on his left offering an 'wedjat'-eye to the god. The second register consists of ten columns of text which contain a prayer to Re\u2018 on behalf of the workman Djehuthermaktuf who is depicted kneeling in adoration in the left-hand corner of the stela. The upper and lower right-hand corners of the stela have been lost and restored in modern times. The surviving upper register is badly worn in places. There are extensive traces of orange paint on the figures in both registers and in the hieroglyphs.

His wife is named as the lady Werner, and she can be identified as the adult female on this lintel. The young girls are thus the daughters of Djehuthermaktuf, although not attested elsewhere. Because of the reference to 'son' in the description of Djehuthermaktuf, this piece probably comes from the tomb of his father Nebdjefau.
