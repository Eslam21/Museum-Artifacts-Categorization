The radiograph reveals the disorganized bones of an infant (sex uncertain) who had suffered from a rare disorder of the bone called osteogenesis imperfecta. It is evident that the cartonnage case itself could have accommodated a larger child. Some teeth, both complete and fragmentary, and the skull and many fragments of bone are stored separately. The cartonnage mummy-case is in the form of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, anthropoid, wearing wig, beard and plumed sun-disc, decorated with polychrome painted funerary deities and protective falcons, with vertical register of hieroglyphs down centre of the body. The foot end of the case is now missing.
