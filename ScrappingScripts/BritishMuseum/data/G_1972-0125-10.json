{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1972,0125.10"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of grotesque child. A naked figure, possibly a child, of uncertain sex, hand-modelled in the round. It appears to be dwarfish, with the head pushed forward, the back rather hunched. The face tends towards the grotesque and no hair is indicated; an applied wreath passes across the brow and behind the ears. The right thigh is raised, the left lowered: the personage is more likely to be dancing than sitting on its right haunch. The pubic area has an applied plug inserted into a socket: it does not seem to be a broken-off phallus as it has pre-firing damage on one edge and a fingerprint on its front face: a separate phallus may have been attached with plaster. There are various splits caused by the firing process; part of the back has flaked away. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a greybrown core. Traces of an overall white dressing, with pink paint adjacent to the right ear and in a groove above the right thigh.
