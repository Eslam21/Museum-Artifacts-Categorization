{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA15082"], "Description": [" Fragmentary basalt male figure, broken from the waist and the left side of the upper body now lost. The figure wears a large shoulder-length \u2018bag wig\u2019 with no discernable hairline across the forehead. The head is broad while the facial features are small and faintly outlined. His eyes are narrow with faint ridges above conveying the eyebrows. The nose is damaged but appears broad at the tip, while his mouth is small with thin lips. The outer corners of his mouth appear slightly upturned. The chin and neck are extremely fleshy and rounded in appearance. His right shoulder is bare, and at the breastbone is the edge of a thick garment which is wrapped around the upper body. Partial remains of a knot of clothing is visible at the chest. His right arm appears to be held close to the side of the body. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar that extends to the back of the head, with a column of incised text. The lower portion of the back-pillar is now lost. The left side of the body and lower area of the back-pillar have been partially reconstructed in modern times. There are small chips across the stone surface on both the wig and body. The nose has been damaged. The object is now attached to a small modern base.
