Not only were they mere utensils, designed to protect the coiffure when sleeping, they also had a magical purpose, namely to ward evil spirits away from the sleeper. In tombs they supported the head of the mummy in his coffin. At the same time they were seen as symbols of resurrection.The headrest of alabaster shown here was found in a tomb of the late Old Kingdom, to the south of the pyramid of Khufu. It consists of a pedestal, a ribbed column and a crescent-shaped support for the head. Headrests were made of stone and also of wood."}
