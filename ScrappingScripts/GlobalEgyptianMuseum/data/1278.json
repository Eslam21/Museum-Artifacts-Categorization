{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7409", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF FAIYUM", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "UNSPECIFIED; PAINTED", "Height": "24.5 cm", "Name": "Heron", "Description": "This small tablet shows two figures of gods. On the right, Heron, military god of thracian origin, is dressed as an officer. He has a head crowned by laurels. In his left hand, he holds a lance and a \"volumen\"; in his right hand, a roman offering dish to perform a libation on the small altar which is found at his feet. The other person, wearing a \"kalathos\" (a basket) on the head, is dressed in a pair of checked trousers,  a brightly coloured tunic and a cloak. He holds in his right hand a double sided axe, in his left hand a spike and a lance around which a serpent entwines itself. The identity of this latter person is not certain: it could be a carean divinity, often represented in the same fashion. The object is probably an ex-voto offered to a sanctuary of the god Heron at the Fayum. The small silhouette on the left seems to be the dedicant."}
