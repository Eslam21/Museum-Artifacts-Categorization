He wears a long pleated kilt and sandals. The text on the lunette, the section in the shape of a half-moon, lists Ani's titles: \"The real scribe of the king, his beloved, the scribe of the offering tables of the king of the Two Lands, the head of the provisions, Ani.\" In the lower register, the servant is leading a bull by a rein.
