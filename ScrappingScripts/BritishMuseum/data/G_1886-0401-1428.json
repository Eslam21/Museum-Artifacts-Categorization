{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1428"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure. Grotesque style bald head, broken away from its separately made figure, probably male and perhaps a priest. He has an elongated bald head and prominent cheeks; the tongue is indicated, the brows are greatly curved, and the neck was socketed into a separately made body. Solid, perhaps made in a two-piece mould. The face was certainly mould-produced, but the back of the head may have been modelled. Traces of a white dressing with some pink paint near the mouth. Grey-brown Nile silt with a grey core and frequent fine gold mica and rare quartz and white inclusions.
