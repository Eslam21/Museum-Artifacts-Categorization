{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA74698"], "Description": [" Unfired pottery figurine of a man with his left arm extended across his chest to his right arm which is held up to his chin; the features of the face are crudely modelled by pinching together the clay to form a beak-like nose. In addition to the two slightly splayed feet the figure is supported by a tail. The figure is roughly formed by pinching the mud into shape before firing.
