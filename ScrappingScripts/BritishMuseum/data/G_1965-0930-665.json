Black-figure decoration is found on several Ionian little-master cups and South Ionian head kantharoi. Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the decorative pattern and the curved junction of the rim and body find parallels with his South Ionian little-master cups and South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 9B. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type XI (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus, the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. For parallels for Ionian little-master cups with black-figure decoration, see British Museum 1888,0601.411. For parallels regarding South Ionian head kantharoi with black-figure decoration on the interior surface of the rim, see Boston MFA 98.925.
