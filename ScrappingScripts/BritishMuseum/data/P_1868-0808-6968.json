Bonaparte is in uniform, with a plumed cocked hat; under his left arm is a large sabre, in his right hand a paper: 'Mem, the grand design haveing failed in Egypt agree to Peace Item to get back all and give up none'. Addington wears his Speaker's wig and robes; his back is oddly and abjectly curved. Behind him and on the extreme right.

He says: \"Oddzooks if this is the beginning, what will be the finish, of the Business\". In the background (left) five men dance round a Liberty Tree, a pole surmounted by bonnet rouge wreathed with laurel (cf.
