This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The Hathoric crown was first associated to the goddess Hathor but from the Late Period onwards, it was largely used for Isis (Hill and Schorsch 2007, 151, note 5; figure identified as Isis in Weiss 2012, Nr. 1494). Isis is also a common topic among Naukratis bronzes. Several figures of Isis, some incomplete, were discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (on this cache and its content: Petrie 1886, 41-42; Masson 2015). According to its registered date of discovery (1885), this figure could pertain to this hoard. The figure could pertain to the very common type Isis nursing Horus, type G12 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 330-331, 822-833, Pl. 56, esp. Nr. 1494 for this specimen). This type became very popular from the Late Period onwards and one of the most depicted themes in bronze statuary (for example: Grenier 2002, 51-58, pl. VIII-X; Goddio and Fabre 2008, 318-9 no. 178-180; Roeder 1956, \u00a7 303-314). Isis nursing is also a theme which is popular in other material in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b).
