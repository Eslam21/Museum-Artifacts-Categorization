{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8456"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela of Pasiast: this round-topped stela is divided into three sections. In the upper register is a winged sun-disk with uraei. The middle register is divided into two parts by a column of text in the centre below a sky-sign. On the left Padiast worships Ra, who stands behind an altar on which a water-pot is cooled by a lotus-flower. On the right the deceased adores Atum. Five lines of text in the third register of the stela contain a prayer to Ra-Horakhty and Osiris on behalf of the prophet of Amun in Karnak, Padiast, otherwise named 'I\u1ec9-m-\u1e25tp, son of the prophet of Amun in Karnak P\u0292-\u1e2br-\u1e2answ and the lady \u1e32rwt. Space is left at the bottom for two pedestals. This stela has been blackened, presumably by fire, with the result that very little of its original colour has survived. There was a red border around all sides of the stela and a multi-coloured border along three sides, but only a bit of red in the last can be distinguished. The disk in the upper register is red, but the rest of the colours are now blackened. The central column in the second register appears to have been white with black text. In the scenes the deceased had a red body and white garment, while red remains on the disk of Ra, the lower body of Atum, and part of his crown. The face of Ra was presumably white with black features. The text is black. In the third register the black text was written on a white background between red dividing lines. The area for the pedestals has been left unplastered. The back and sides apart from the bottom edge have been plastered white.
