", " Made in Naukratis, with identical piece found on site in the 1899 season (Gutch in Hogarth 1898-9, 92 n.5, pl.13, no.191) dated Ptolemaic or Roman period. A number of Harpocrates from the same mould were found at Naukratis (British Museum Bailey 2008, no.3060 GR1886,0401.1442, Bristol H2814 and probably Cambridge NA629). Variants of this macrophallic reclining Harpocrates with side knot type has been found in Saqqara. The Naukratis terracotta workshop area was dated to the 3rd and 2nd century BC (Bailey 2008, nos. 3058-60), though Late Hellenistic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no.72) and 1st-2nd century AD dates for similar pieces has been suggested (Fischer 1994, no.575). Variants have been found at Theadelphia (Weber 1914, no.60) or unprovenanced (Sotheby\u2019s Sale Catalogue, 18 May 1987, lot 113) and they were making similar examples in a terracotta shop at Memphis (Engelbach et al. 1915, pl. 61: 45(1)).
