{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86904"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a a flat surface with imprints of some organics either a plant or textile? One impression of a turned cord with a width of 0.2cm is visible in the break. The upper side is roughly flat with the lateral sides bending downwards and showing many finger imprints. Less than two thirds of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable are two registers, the upper one shows three figures, the one on the left side seems to be seated, maybe Re-Harakhte, the middle one looks mummy-shaped with a staff in front of the body, probably Ptah. The figure on the right shows a standing female goddess also holding a staff in front of her, probably Sekhmet. The lower register shows half of a kneeling figure with the hands raised (C11). The same motif is found on EA86912 with the left part of the impression better preserved.
