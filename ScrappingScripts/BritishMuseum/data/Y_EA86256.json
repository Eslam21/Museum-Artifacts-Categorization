Relatively little details, whitish-beige colour with incised lines, glazed in white. The division between elytra and prothorax is indicated by three short incised lines of about 1mm of lenghts, while the suture is not visible. At the left elytron in the lower part two further short lines, but not on the right side. Clypeus and eyes visible but no further details shown. The side only shows one incised line surrounding the object. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base. In the middle a p above t and H right of it (p-t-H), the p shows three inner horizontal lines. Left and right of it a vertical line and at the outside of it a thin nb-basket on both sides framing the seal. The perforation, which is longitudinal to the object, is partly broken out, destroying part of the seal where the H is placed.
