For prints by Arthur Pond after this drawing in reverse which date this drawing 1670. See 2006,U.1114-1116 and 1936,1116.2126.44. The strong chiaroscuro of the present sheet was achieved by Claude through the application of dark washes in the foreground and vast expanses of brilliant white heightening. The effect is that of a scene set as dusk, which is reflected in the completed painting, now in the Hermitage in St Petersburg (see inv. no. 1236; canvas, 116 x 158.5 cm; Roethlisberger 1986, no. 231). The work was commissioned to form a pendant with LV154, of the Rest on the Flight to Egypt (see inv. no. 1957,1214.160) by Henri van Hamale in Antwerp. Its dimensions, of 116 x 158.5cm are large, are reflective of the level of detail that the scene contains. This essentially depends various compositions including LV158 and LV106 of Hagar and the Angel. It is preceded by various drawings through which Claude worked out the compositon, including two rapid renderings of the overall scene that are both in the BM (see inv. nos. Oo,6.133 and Oo,6.134; respectively Roethlisberger 1968, nos. 913 and 914) and another larger study that is close to the completed composition that is in the Munich Staatliche Graphische Sammlung (inv. no. 3,185; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 915).
