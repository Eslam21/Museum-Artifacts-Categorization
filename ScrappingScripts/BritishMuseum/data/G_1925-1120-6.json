{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1925,1120.6"], "Description": [" Terracotta squatting female figure. The upper part of a woman seated on a birthing-stool. She wears a long chiton pulled back above her knees to leave her lower legs bare, and a large shawl-like cloth over her head; its lower edge is indicated at the rear. Her facial features give a strained effect. Probably both hands were placed upon her knees, but only that on her right side survives. The edge of the stool is shown at the back and it was probably ring-shaped and three-legged: the leg at the rear is broken away, as is the entire stool at the front. Hollow; made in a two-piece mould, with the rear stool leg defined by cut out areas on each side of it. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt with a grey core. White dressing overall surviving in large areas. The shawl was painted grey-blue, the chiton pink, and the underside of the seat of the stool was painted yellow.
