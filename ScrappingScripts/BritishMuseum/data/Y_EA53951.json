During the Roman and Byzantine periods, the type of mud stopper found at Antinoupolis was commonly used on wine amphorae produced by estates, unlike the plaster examples (EA 53955, 53957\u201363) that were used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, type 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: type7). Egloff associates mud stoppers like those from Antinoupolis with late 4th\u20137th century AD amphora types, particularly LR 7 (Egloff 1977, no. 353, pl. 20). The amphora is a typical Nile Valley LR 7 wine amphora, with a ribbed neck and flat handles, made from a micaeous chocolate brown Nile silt fabric. LRA7 amphorae date from the late 4th to the 7th or 8th century AD, though similar forms persist into the early Islamic period (Keay and Williams 2005, LRA7). For the cross stamp, cf., impressions from Western Thebes (Winlock and Crum, 80, fig. 33.1\u20132). The motif is common on Late Roman amphora stoppers in Egypt, e.g., at Kellia (Egloff 1977, pl. 20.3\u20137) and Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, fig. 10). For the stamp itself, cf. a similar, simple circular cross on a wooden stamp without text found at Koptos (Nachtergael 2000, 289, fig. 23). See also EA 53957. Bruy\u00e8re, B. 1966.
