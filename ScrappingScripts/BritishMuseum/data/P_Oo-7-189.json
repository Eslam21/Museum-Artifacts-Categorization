This might be considered as a nature study that Claude would have referred to when composing these paintings. It was first drawn in black chalk with the trunk of tree reaching to the bottom of the sheet. The brown wash was sensitively used to add interest to the composition; note, for instance the two delicate figures at the base of the tree trunk. The style and technique compares with another landscape drawing, also in pale brown wash, now in the Teylers Museum (inv. no. 81; Roethlisberger 1968, no. 697). Lit.: A.M.
