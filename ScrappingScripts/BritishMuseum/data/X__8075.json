", " This zoomorphic weight is an exception in Naukratis corpus of weights (see also a 'cow-shaped weight' kept in Toronto, Royal Ontario Museum 910.139.1). Zoomorphic weights in bronze were particularly popular in the Late Bronze Age (see for example the set of weights from Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios in Cyprus: Lassen 2000, fig. 16.1). More specifically, weights in the shape of frogs were also discovered in the Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Uluburun (Pulak 2000, fig. 17.3, W 136 and W 143). This weight is not illustrated in Petrie's publication, but he mentioned a frog in bronze in his Naukratis list of weights (Petrie 1886, 77, no. 265), confirming the Naukratite origin of this early type of weight.
