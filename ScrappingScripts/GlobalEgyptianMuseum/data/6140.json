Unguent vessels are among the objects commonly taken by the dead for the afterlife. Most commonly made of alabaster, they were sometimes like the present example made of hard stone. A similar-looking sign was used in hieroglyphic writing as a determinative for words meaning unguent or oil. Thus in this case we can deduce the content of this vessel from its shape."}
