This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " More than a hundred votive boxes were discovered in Naukratis. The bulk of them originate from a building located in the southern part of the city (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Most of Naukratis votive boxes display a figure of a reptile or an eel, both particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (for example the lizard: Weiss 2012, 278-279). K. Weiss describes this specimen as a \u2018Fishk\u00e4stchen\u2019, though precises that the type is unclear (Weiss 2012, 267-268). Since no figure is preserved, it is more prudent to not associate it with any votive box types. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
