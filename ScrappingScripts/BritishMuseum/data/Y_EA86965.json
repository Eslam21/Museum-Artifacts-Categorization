{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86965"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is small and flat and shows fragments of charcoal and mica. The underside is flat and shows impressions of a basket, the side of the piece shows basketry as well, the piece was therefore placed at the rim of a basket/lid. The diameter of the basket is approximately 10 cm. The seal impression originates from a scarab-like seal, showing a circumferential line. On the right a standing figure with white crown is shown, facing to the centre of the seal. Behind the persons head and in front of the crown each another line. The person is directed towards some sort of flowers or offering table, three stems are visible, one bigger in the middle and two smaller ones flanking each side. Above this a sun disc is shown. The area at the left is partly broken and nothing can be seen. The number written on the object is 732 instead of 723 as the object card shows.
