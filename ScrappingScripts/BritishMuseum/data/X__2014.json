", " A number of East Greek terracotta alabastron in the form of a standing kore are known from Naukratis, from a range of mould series and fabric variants (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1400, GR1886,0401.1421 ; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.392; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA322, NA324 Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1886.466). Parrallels from Kamiros, dated mid to late 6th century BC (Higgins 1954, no. 47, 48 62; GR 1861,1024.7, GR1852,0112.6; GR1861, 0425.34). There is a close parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC-400BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2114). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9). Probably from South Ionia, Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). A parallel from Erythrae, Turkey, dated between c. 540BC to c. 520BC (Bayburtluo\u011flu 1977, 80-1, pls. 9, 11 and 16, nos. 17, 19 and 27).
