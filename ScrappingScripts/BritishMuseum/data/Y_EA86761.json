{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86761"], "Description": [" Complete seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows one side with one coil of basketry and another side with a flat area with impressions of plant fibres which seem to be from a basket as well. The top shows finger impressions and a complete impression of an oval scarab-like seal that is not well preserved. Visible is a circumferential line, inside on the left a kneeling enemy facing to the right with a lion jumping on its shoulders. Behind the lion a cobra facing to the right. At the bottom of the seal another lying enemy with its hands on the back. This seems to be the same motif as EA86753.
