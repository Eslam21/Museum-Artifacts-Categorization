{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 20569", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "43 cm", "Width": "30 cm", "Name": "Stela of Seneb-en-ef", "Description": "A stela was dedicated to Seneb-en-ef, son of Sat-Hathor who was the \"Overseer of the Storeroom of Surplus of the Chief of Works.\" It comes from Abydos where it was placed as a commemorative monument inscribed with offering formulae, allowing its owner to benefit from the offerings and rituals in honor of Osiris, lord of Abydos and the god of the hereafter. The text begins in the middle of the top and runs on both sides in vertical columns. The invocation offering formula begins at the top left; goes to the middle figure and finishes at the right-hand jamb. It reads as follows: \"May the king give an offering and may Osiris, lord of Abydos, give an invocation offering, consisting of bread, beer, calves, fowl, clothing, and alabaster (as well as all good things) for the Overseer of the Storeroom of the Surplus of the Chief of Works (called) Seneb-en-ef, son of Sat- Hathor, the Venerated One.\"The right-hand column reads as follows: \"O people, who shall pass upon this road, up-stream or down-stream! You have to say: a thousand bread, beer, calves, and fowl.\" The wish is completed in the text in the middle of the figure, giving the name and title of the deceased. The deceased was satisfied by the invocation offerings, which cost nothing, \"it is only a breath of air coming out of the mouth,\" as they always indicated in similar texts."}
