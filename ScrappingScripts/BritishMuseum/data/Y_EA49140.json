According to Petrie, the cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city provided nine of this category of votive boxes (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Votive boxes of this peculiar type were particularly associated to the solar god and demiurge Atum (Weiss 2012, 276-277). They belong to the type T 13 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 725-727, Taf. 42c, 75a/g, 77l, Typ T 13, esp. Nr. 741-743, 745-746 from Naukratis).
