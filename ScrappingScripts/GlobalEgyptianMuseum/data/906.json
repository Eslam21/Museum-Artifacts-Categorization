It has a lid in the shape of a human head and a text referring to Amset the Son of Horus. The name of the owner is followed by the name of the city of Memphis, which could mean that Amenemope originally came from the ancient capital. On the other hand, his title implies that he was active in Thebes. It is not certain whether the owner of this vase is the same person as the owner of Theban Tomb No. 276 (see also E.5899)."}
