He holds a fan in his left hand, showing that he had the title \"Fan bearer on the right of the king.\" Osiris is wrapped in mummy bandages from which his arms emerge to hold the \"Was\", or prosperity, and Djed, or stability, scepters. He wears his distinctive Atef crown. The Apis bull, with a solar disk on its head, stands behind Osiris. Ten lines of hieroglyphic text cover the rest of the stela, praising the gods of the Memphite Necropolis for the sake of the Ka of Rahotep."}
