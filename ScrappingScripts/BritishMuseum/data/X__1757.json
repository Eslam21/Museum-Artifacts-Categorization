Another group of 20 cat fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor, are in the British Museum (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Boubastis. The British Museum examples were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria."], "Bibliographic references": [" Edgar 1903 / Greek sculpture.
