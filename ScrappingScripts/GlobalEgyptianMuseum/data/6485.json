The back is fashioned in such a fashion as to represent the silhouette of the buttocks.  The loins are pierced by two holes that might represent tattoos similar to those of found on other examples of this type of figurine. The belly is very flat and is incised with the representation of the pubes (triangle filled with little dots).  On this surface are also found four round and shallow impressions, which represent a geometrical motif: one in the middle of the pubes, the other three at the corners of the latter, emphasising it. Similar impressions are found in the sides of the figurine."}
