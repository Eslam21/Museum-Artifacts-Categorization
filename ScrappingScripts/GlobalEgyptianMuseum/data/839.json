He wore a crown, the upper part of which, consisting of two tall plumes, has disappeared. On his chin may be seen the beginning of a false beard. The facial features bear the characteristics of Amarna art: note the elongated almond-shaped eyes, the curves traced by the nose, the emphasis of the eyebrows, and the delicately carved lips. Jean Capart was of the opinion that the god in this statue took on the youthful features of Tutankhamun."}
