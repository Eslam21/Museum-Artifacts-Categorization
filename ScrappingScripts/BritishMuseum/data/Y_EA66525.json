Even if Petrie illustrated the impression of a mould in the shape of a curled lion (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 7), he did not list it in his description of the moulds discovered at the site (Petrie 1886, 37). Such scaraboids were, nonetheless, likely produced locally in the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). For a scaraboid with a curled lion back from Naukratis, see also the one published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 110. This scaraboid could belong to Gorton's type XXXIII A, although the specific shape of this scaraboid and this exact combination of hieroglyphs is not listed in this type (Gorton 1996, 118-121, type XXXIII A). Though the hieroglyphic signs on its base could have just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957). The lion shape of the scaraboid itself can be associated with solar deties. Lions were used to write the name of Ra during the Late Period, as the lion is a phonetic equivalent Rw (De Wit 1951, 138ff).
