", " The exterior surface of the sherd was burnt during the bombings in London in 1941 during WWII. According to Johnston, the sherd finds parallels with the W\u00fcrzburg chalices (Lemos no. 236-7) although this sherd has more detail. Lemos attributes the sherd stylistically to the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl. The sherd most probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.460.k, which Lemos took to be close to the Painter, not by him.
