{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA37639"], "Description": [" Fragmentary schist statue of Tutankhamun usurped by the later ruler Horemheb, with the head and lower body below the kilt now missing. The king wears a beaded broad-collar around the neck which extends onto the tops of the shoulders, and a belted short kilt wrapped at the front. The belt sits higher on the back and slopes forward to accommodate the swollen belly of the king and is incised with the prenomen of Tutankhamun at the centre of the belt. The kilt has a pleated front panel in the centre, with two individual shorter strands of material on either side of the panel. At the edge of the panel is a rectangular shaped hole that may have once included an inlay. On the left side, the king originally held a standard with much of the original text now lost, though a surviving section of text at chest level and next to the kilt includes the name of Tutankhamun. On the reverse are the remains are a slim back-pillar with a column of incised text, the beginning and end portion now lost. The cartouche of the back-pillar includes the partial prenomen of the later king Horemheb, with the rest of the cartouche left blank, and evidence of erasure on the lower section of the back-pillar. In addition to the loss of the head and lower body, the right arm is missing with intact peg holes along the right arm which demonstrate how the arm would have been attached to the body. The left arm and standard have been damaged with several large chips to the stone surface, as well as a large chip to the torso area and several smaller damaged areas across the chest.

While the back-pillar central cartouche from this statue has deliberately been erased, it has been suggested that the name across the standard and its poor preservation appears to be accidental rather than intentional erasure (Eaton-Krauss 2015). The poor quality of the usurped text from this statue has also been noted (Hall 1928: 75), in particular the incorrect orientation of the back-pillar cartouche, and the contrast in quality of the carving from the original inscription of the back-pillar. The mention of Amun-Re within the belt inscription has led to suggestions that this figure may have originated from Karnak (Bierbrier 1993; Eaton-Krauss 2015). Further Bibliography: M.
