{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1906,0301.10"], "Description": [" Fragment of a small terracotta grotesque figure (probably a monkey?) head and legs missing. The hunchbacked torso is egg-shaped and hollow, with the belly button marked by a small circular hole. The top of the thighs are preserved, separated from the torso by a groove, with the right leg raised, indicating that the figure is meant to be dancing (?) or sitting (?). The base of the neck is preserved and shows that the head originally protruded forward from the humped back. The arms are represented by thin coils of modelled clay applied to the body and outlined by a groove. The right arm extends vertically down the side of the body, bent upwards at the elbow, the right hand probably holding the head. The left arm encircles the torso backwards, towards the buttocks. Another thin coil is applied to the left part of the torso\u2019s front, coming up from the groin, curving around the neck and going down again on the right side, probably the tail of the animal.
