Brunton, \u2018Mostagedda and the Tasian Culture\u2019 (London, 1937), 116), a thick copper wire or nail had corroded into the perforation, no trace of which now remains. This suggests that the piece did not function as a true bead but was possibly once attached to a flat surface. A very similar object with a copper shank still in place is illustrated in W. M. F. Petrie, 'Gizeh and Rifeh' (Warminster, 1977), pl.XIIIC, 105, where it is referred to as a button. It may be of significance that the four boss-beads found in Pan Grave burials at Mostagedda were in pairs, two from this burial (see also 1930,0711.219) and two from grave 3138 (see 1930,0711.258). Also from this burial: boss-bead (1930,0711.219), beads (1930,0711.218.B). Bibliography: G. Brunton, \u2018Mostagedda and the Tasian Culture\u2019 (London, 1937), 116, 126; pl.
