This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Schlotzhauer Identifies the cup as belonging to a Type 9B South Ionian cup with everted rim. Type 9B cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). Schlotzhauer notes that the high stemmed foot closely resembles that on Attic Little Master cups but he places the cup within his Type 9B on account of the rim. The same high stemmed foot is found on Type X cup from Hayes' typology, which finds parallels with Schlotzhauer's Type 9C. Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Robinson published the cup as coming from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite but Fairbanks provides the provenance only as Naukratis. Schlotzhauer notes that the ancient drill hole does not appear to have been made in an attempt to repair the cup. Furthermore, given the location of the hole, through the thick bottom of the vase, Schlotzhauer does not see the cult act of rendering the cup unusable since it would have been faster and easier to drill the hole in a thinner part of the cup. Rather, he prefers to see a burial rite or that the cup was altered in order to fasten an object made from a different, perhaps precious, material and thus suggests that the cup came from a burial and not from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite. He points to the lack of a votive inscription on the near complete vessel to show that it was not a votive offering. Other sherds from burials were noted during Gardner's excavation (Boston MFA 88.815). A similarily drilled South Ionian cup was found at Miletus, which originally had a bronze bracket attached to it.
