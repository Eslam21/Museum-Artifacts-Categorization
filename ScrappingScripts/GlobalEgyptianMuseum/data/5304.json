One very clear symbol of the attitude behind this are the commemorative scarabs for this king, systematically produced and distributed, designed to propagate his fame and that of his wife Tiy throughout Egypt and abroad. This specimen has a text dealing with a lion hunt: a message about the successes achieved during the royal hunt; between his first and the tenth regnal year, he killed 102 wild lions himself."}
