{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["1865,1118.249"], "Description": [" Roman terracotta lamp with a caricatured scene: mould-made lamp with a voluted nozzle, mostly lost. Between the nozzle volutes is an air-slit. The top is decorated with a crocodile; rising from its tail is a huge human phallus on which sits a naked woman with her hair drawn back in a bun. She holds a palm branch in her left hand; behind her plants, probably intended to be Nilotic, rise up. Although made many decades later than than her death, this may be an obscene caricature of Cleopatra VII. The lamp stands on a slightly raised base. Covered with a streaky finger-marked orange-red to dark brown slip.
