Also good parallels in British Museum (GR1875,0313.17; GR1875,0313.18), published by Vassilika, possibly from the same mould series as Naukratis examples (GR.56.1887 and GR.55.1887) were originally supplied with a false provenance (purchased in 1875 from antiquities dealers Rollin & Feuardent, known to operate in Egypt).
