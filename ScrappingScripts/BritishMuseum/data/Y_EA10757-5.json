Ramesseum 4, Frame 5. Papyrus written on the recto in hieratic script. The recto contains a magico-medical text related to pregnancy and birth/mother and child and some fragments of P. Ramesseum 1. On the verso there are some later accounts. The text is written in vertical columns. This frame contains fourteen fragments which appear in the following order from top left to bottom right: Div 1-3, Frag. 6 (?), Diii 1-3, P. Ramesseum 1 Ci 1-3 (bottom in two parts), P. Ramesseum 1 Frag. 5, one unidentified, Dii 3-4, Dv 2-3, two pieces fused together, Dv 2, Dii 3, Diii 1-2 and Div 2-3. The papyrus was a full-height roll. The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
