{"artifact_name": "human mummy; mummy-wrapping; mummy-packing(?)", "Object Type": [" human mummy ", " mummy-wrapping ", " mummy-packing (?) "], "Museum number": ["EA6725"], "Description": [" Oval packet, taken from a mummy, wrapped in linen bandages, encrusted with resin. Birch Slip suggests that the bundle might contain human hair. Radiography and CT scanning were inconclusive. The contents of the bundle, a white material, were exposed at several points through damage. A small sample of this material was analysed by Raman spectrometry and found to be sodium sulphate. This suggests that the bundle contains materials used in the mummification process. It is possible that some hair is also present, as suggested by the CT scan. "], "Findspot": [" Found/Acquired: Egypt "], "Materials": [" human tissue (?)
