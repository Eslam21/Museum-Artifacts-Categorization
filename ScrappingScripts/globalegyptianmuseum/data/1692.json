{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1894:148", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SEAL", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Height": "0.6 cm", "Width": "1.1 cm", "Name": "Amulet of a stamp seal", "Description": "Granite pyramidal funerary amulet, with suspension loop at the tip. This solar form is one of a range of types placed on the body in mummification during the Late Period and after. Its precise significance is uncertain. It may represent a stamp-seal, as part of the equipment of a scribe; in Egypt only those of higher status could read and write, and funerary texts include requests for writing equipment, to obtain a good afterlife. However, the pyramidal form does not seem to have been used for stamp-seals in daily life, and these exclusively Late Period amulets may hold some other meaning."}
