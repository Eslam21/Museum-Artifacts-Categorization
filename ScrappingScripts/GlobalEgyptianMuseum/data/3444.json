All that remains of the top register is one of the cobras from the winged sun-disk. In the centre of the middle register is the symbol of Abydos with Osiris on it's left, holding a was-sceptre before him. Behind Osiris is the goddess Isis, her left hand touching his shoulder in a characteristically protective gesture. To the right of the fetish is the god Anubis who looks over his shoulder to the deceased whose hand he holds, his other arm is raised towards the centre. It is uncertain if the deceased is male or female as the head is broken away. Below the figures are two recumbent jackals facing one another, their bodies still retaining traces of black, carved in sunk relief."}
