", " The fragment is strikingly similar to British Museum 1965,0930.439 and in the same style as the handle fragment of a jug or hydria found on Samos (Walter-Karydi, \u2018Samos - VI/1 Samische Gef\u00e4sse des 6. Jahrhunderts v. Chr.\u2019, (Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut), Bonn (1973), pl. 60, no. 497, with volute palmette in relief). The missing plastic decoration may have resembled the bud on British Museum 1888,0601.647.d. The fabric finds parallels with British Museum 1888,0601.644.c. This sherd was analysed with NAA by Hans Mommsen (Bonn). The origin of the fabric (NAUK 47) was not identified and considered a chemical singleton.
