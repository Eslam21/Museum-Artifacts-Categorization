{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 99123", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "SCULPTURE IN THE ROUND", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Height": "24 cm", "Name": "Head of a Woman, Probably a Wig Support", "Description": "This beautiful stuccoed wooden head, which was discovered in the tomb of Aperia, is nearly unique. The upper part of the head, the eyes, and the eyebrows were painted black, while the lips were colored red. The ears were adorned with large earrings and were also painted black. A similar head was found by Jean-Philippe Lauer in the Great Court of the Complex of Djoser. Remarking that the neck is longer than natural, Lauer suggested that the head had never been attached to a body but had carried a wig. His hypothesis is confirmed by the discovery of this object, since some hairs, probably natural, were found stuck to it. According to Alain Pierre Zivie, this type of head was most probably used as a wig support. It was placed in the tomb with other adornment and toilette accessories."}
