XXXVIII, 16) might be a simplified version of the same type: same overall design, but details are different, probably due to Petrie's desire to regularise the original. He refers also in his text to two moulds 'for eye bullae' (Petrie 1886, 37). Probably cut directly into mould with a point, rather than impressed from a master. ", " In addition to glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids, the \u2018Scarab Factory\u2019 at Naukratis was also producing amulets (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming; see also Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Petrie listed a number of amulet-moulds including a similar type of this piece (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 16). Several similar moulds used to produced wedjat-eye in bulla form were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1920,0417.7, Oxford Ashmolean Museum AN1888.216.10, Oxford Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4572 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 11.45969. Details of modelling are especially close to BM 1920,0417.7 but not identical. Gorton, A.
