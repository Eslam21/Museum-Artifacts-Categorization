Vane Tempest and Mr. Cookson. This was expected 'to form a new era on the turf. Hambletonian won by half a neck. 'Lond. Chron.', 25 and 26 Mar.; 'Stud Book', 1802. The chief public sources of Continental news were the Hamburg Mails and the French newspapers; the news eagerly awaited was of the war between Austria and France, Francis II having made his long-awaited declaration of war on 12 Mar.; after some success on the Upper Inn the French were defeated at Stockach (25 Mar.). 'Lond. Chron.', Mar., 'passim.' The news from India was that open hostilities with Tipu Sahib were inevitable. Ibid., 9 Mar. For the Income Tax see BMSat 9363, &c. for the Report of the Secret Committee, BMSat 9369. Besides the anxieties over the Union (see BMSat 9284, &c.) another Irish rising with French support was feared. Ibid., 16th Mar.; 'Cornwallis Corr.' iii. 76, 77, 81.
