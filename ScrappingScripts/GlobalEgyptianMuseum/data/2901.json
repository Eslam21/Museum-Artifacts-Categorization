{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:244", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "BEAD", "Material": "BASALT ?", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Diameter": "0.9 cm", "Name": "Bead", "Description": "Small circular bead of black stone, possibly basalt, perforated at centre for suspension. In the absence of archaeological context, its interest lies in the date of acquisition, as part of the collection of antiquities formed by Lady Harriet Kavanagh. Her collection with its inventory provides a rare example of a well-documented private group of materials from the 1840s. Each item would correspond to a desirable, affordable and transportable example of a category of antiquity, in this case ancient jewellery."}
