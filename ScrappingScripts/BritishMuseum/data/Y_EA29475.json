Above eac foot is a jackal representing Anubis, and the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, in attitudes of lamentation, appear at the sides. An inscription in raised relief runs along the centre and is orientated so as to be legible from the head-end. On the base of the foot case the soles of the sandals are represented, each of which bears the figure of a foreign captive whose arms are bound around his waist with twisted papyrus tsalks. Both men are portrayed with the complexion, beard and costume associated in Egyptian art with the inhabitants of Syria-Palestine. There is chequer-board decoration around the edges of the foot-case.
