{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1990,0601.2"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Harpokrates. Harpokrates sitting with his legs extended to his right, leaning to his left to hold with both hands a large lantern with a domed top and finial; a mark on the dome may indicate an ivy-leaf-shaped smoke-hole. He wears a very brief tunic with short sleeves which leaves his lower body bare, and above a row of curls has a large tightly woven and bound wreath, the ties of which fall lappet-like onto his shoulders. The group is placed upon an uneven curvefronted plain plinth. The back is plain, with a suspension-lug behind the neck. An arched opening has been cut after moulding into the body of the lantern, and burning at the top of the opening shows that the object has been used at some time as a lamp. Hollow; made in a two-piece mould with an added floor. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt.
