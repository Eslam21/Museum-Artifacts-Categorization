F Petrie at Abydos. It is characterised by a round base which is slightly flattened. The upper part is ornamented by many lines in the colours black, white and red. The belly carries an inscription containing a small formula for recitation by  the Son of Horus Qebehsenuf in favour of the owner, who has the name of Pahemnetjer. The jar, which seems to be too small to actually contain the human viscera, probably dates from the end of the New Kingdom or the beginning of the 21st Dynasty."}
