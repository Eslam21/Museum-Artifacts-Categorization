{"artifact_name": "figure; plaque", "Object Type": [" figure ", " plaque "], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.42"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure plaque of ithyphallic lute-player. Probably Harpocrates. A coarsely made relief of a figure seated with its knees raised and with a colossal phallus that rises up on its left side and curves over, the glans resting on its head. It plays a lute which angles across its body. Although the face has been damaged, it appears to be that of a monkey, and an uncertain object placed by its left side appears to have the tip of a tail curling across it. The lower part of the object is broken away together with the feet; there is slight damage above the object on the figure\u2019s left side. The back is flat and at the bottom the edge begins to curve forward to the break, leaving very little room for a plinth. One-piece mould. Micaceous brick-red Nile silt with a thick grey core and white inclusions. A minute lump of a white dressing remains in the groove defining the glans.

Similar parallel from Antinoopolis (?), which is a monkey with a tambourine, leaning against a large phallus, not certainly his own. (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E. 80.1914). The \u2018Antinoopolis(?)\u2019 provenance for the Late Period to Ptolemaic parallels currently in the Fitzwilliam is dubious. The Fitzwilliam parallels most likely come from Naukratis (Petrie and Gardner 1884-1886) or less likely Memphis (Petrie 1907 and 1914)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Terracotta / Catalogue of Terracottas in the British Museum (3782) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DC.099) (Phase 1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Face damaged, lower part of figure broken away."], "Subjects": [" music ", " anthropomorphism ", " ancient egyptian deity "], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Harpocrates (?)
