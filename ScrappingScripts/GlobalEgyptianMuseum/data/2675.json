Each shabti is equipped with picks and baskets to represent the deceased in any heavy manual labour required in the underworld. From the New Kingdom to the Ptolemaic Period hundreds of shabtis were included in elite burials, to cover the needs of any day in the year. During the 26th Dynasty the art of faience shabti production reached its peak, with <!-->turquoise-coloured glazes and fine, clear hieroglyphic inscription, giving chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead, in which the figure is summoned to replace the deceased in agricultural works. This example is inscribed for a leading courtier of the day, the admiral Tjaennehebu, who was buried in a chamber south of the pyramid of Unas at Saqqara."}
