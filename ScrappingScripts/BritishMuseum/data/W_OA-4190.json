", " All the illustrated specimens share the same reverse die, but there are three different dies with the same legend and some of the pieces which are not illustrated may be from other dies. The same reverse is also found on d\u012bn\u0101r-system weights with obverses of al-Man\u1e63\u016br (see for example OA+ 4231). As for the obverse, it was introduced in \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. \u02bfAl\u012b's second governorship for it is found with two different reverses in the name of \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. \u02bfAl\u012b and Chael (Fahmi 224-5; Balog 1976, 296, which is from the reverse die of OA+ 4233. Cf. Balog 1976, 297). Since it had no name on it the obverse could continue in use when \u02bfAbd al-Malik replaced \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 as governor once again.
