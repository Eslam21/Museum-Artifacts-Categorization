{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86687"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, one side shows one rows of basketry coil, the other side shows an uneven surface. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica. The object was hardened after excavation. The upper part is slightly concave, with a deep impression of a small scarab-like seal impression. The impression itself is quite worn, on the left maybe a nsw-plant (M22) or a nfr? and at the right further signs, maybe a seated deity, but illegible.
