{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Hathor (also known as Isis-Hathor and or Aphrodite-Hathor), naked and with her hands to her sides. Her hair is parted in the centre and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears a wreath and vine or ivy leaves fall beside her upper arms. Below the leaves wide ribbons hang from the headdress. Surmounting the upper wreath is a tall flaring kalathos with a wavy edge, on the front of which are the disc and horns of Hathor in relief. She has a narrow grooved plinth following the line of her feet. The back has a very summary treatment, only the horizontal line of the hair, the buttocks, and a groove between the legs being indicated. The right side of the kalathos is broken and lost. There are faint traces of a white dressing and the piece was likely painted. Hollow, from a two-piece, rather worn mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt.

Other close parallels are from the Ptolemaic terracotta workshop found by sebakhin at the eastern side of Naukratis (\u2018Site no. 95\u2019, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no.1888.178, Egypt Exploration Fund, first season) and three very close fragments of feet and lower legs only from the third to the second century BC contexts in Naukratis (Leonard 2001, pl. 3.8). There is a left lower part fragement dated to the Roman period from Coptos (Ballet 2000, 184, no.155) and unprovenanced pieces from Egypt (Breccia 1934, no.11), dated to the first or second century AD (Fischer 1994, no. 812). Similar pieces from 'Antinoopolis' (Dunand 1990, no. 329), dated from the second to third century AD (because of the alleged findspot?), and from the Roman period (ibid. no. 338), from Bubastis, but slimmer (Hilton Price 1897, 400, no. 3316), fragment from House K at Herakleopolis Magna, dated by Petrie to c.
