", " Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the shape, fabric, and decoration find parallels with his Type 11,3.A South Ionian cup with everted rim.

The place of production of Type 11 South Ionian cups is determined as Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.570) from Naukratis and of same shape, decoration, and fabric.
