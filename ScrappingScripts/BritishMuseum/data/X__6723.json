", " This appears to be a fragment of a socketed trilobate arrow-head, that are common in the Middle East from the 7th century BC and subsequently in Greece and Egypt until the early Hellenistic period. However, it is not possible to distinguish which variant this is, though there are parallels across the Eastern Mediterranean, Egypt and Middle East (James 2004; Baitinger 2001; Snodgrass 1964; Erdmann 1973; Oren 1984).
