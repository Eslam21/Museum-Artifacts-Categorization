{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1006.5"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Harpokrates. Harpokrates seated on a low rough plinth, supporting himself with his left arm (flaked away and largely lost, but almost certainly holding a pot), with his legs extending somewhat to his right, the left knee on the ground, the right knee raised. A himation falls from his left shoulder; it passed behind him and is drawn forward to cover his right leg and left foot. His finger is to his mouth and he may have a side-lock: he wears a tightly woven and bound wreath with no other hair showing beneath it; the wreath\u2019s ribbons rest on his shoulders. A break at the top of the head perhaps removed a Double Crown or, less likely, lotus buds. At his right side is a tallnecked amphora on a stand, surmounted by a circular loaf decorated with a rosette. The back is plain with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt.
