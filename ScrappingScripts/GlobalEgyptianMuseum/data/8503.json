{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "1984/79/I/29", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MUSICAL INSTRUMENT", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "14 cm", "Width": "3.6 cm", "Name": "Sistrum", "Description": "Sistrum \"shesheset\" with the whole top part missing, consisting of a loop crossed by snake-formed rods that rattled when it was shaken. All that remains is the handle ending in the cow-horned head of the goddess Hathor. On each side of the face is a serpent, one of them adorned with the solar disc and the other with the white crown of Upper Egypt. There is a representation of a cat sitting on its hind quarters in the central part from which the missing loop sprang. The sistrum played a key role in the worship of the goddess Hathor and it was rattled in the religious ceremonies, in which music was part of the ritual."}
