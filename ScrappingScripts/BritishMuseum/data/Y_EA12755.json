A circular shield is on the left arm, decorated with a central star and an outer band of rays. The right arm is raised, but is lost from the elbow, together with his sword; the lower part of its scabbard is indicated on Bes's left side, below the shield. Plain flat-fronted plinth. Back plain, except for the rectangular element from which his feathers spring, and two grooves running from his shoulders to join just above an irregularly circular vent. Right side of head and most of face restored in plaster. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt. Traces of a red colour, probably post-firing.
