The manufacture recalls the various figures in cream glaze with added dark brown glaze discovered in Naukratis, and possibly made locally. Several of these figures were dedicated in the Greek sanctuaries. This amulet was probably found in the Temple of Apollo as the Pataikos amuletic figure (Petrie 1886, 14, pl. II, no. 15), although Petrie refers to the town as a findspot in the plates' contents for both amulets (Petrie 1886, 99, pl. II, no. 12-18). The child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). His cult was particularly developed in the Delta during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (Sandri 2006).
