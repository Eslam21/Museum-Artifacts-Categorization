{"artifact_name": "figure; statue", "Object Type": [" figure ", " statue "], "Museum number": ["EA30448"], "Description": [" Red quartzite(?) head of Amenhotep III, the body of the statue now lost. The king wears the khepresh or blue crown, a royal headdress which is rounded at the top and features a flared ridge on the reverse that slopes down on either side of the crown above the ears. The crown is decorated with a dotted circular pattern. The body of the uraeus cobra sits along the centre of the crown above the forehead of the king, with circular coils of its body and its long tail reaching back over the top of the crown. Underneath the uraeus, two incised horizontal bands run across the edge of the crown. The king is depicted with arched eyebrows and elongated narrow eyes which extend out to the temples. The eyes are particularly slanted at the outer edges, and a fold of flesh is conveyed by two fine incised lines carved between the eyes and eyebrow. The nose is slim and the mouth is full with thick lips, with the outer corners turned upwards to form a small smile. On the reverse of the head there are traces of the round-topped back-pillar at the neck. There are slight scratches to the stone surface across the face and crown of the king, with a small chip visible on the left side of the crown at the uraeus. A few further chips are notable along the ridge of the crown at the reverse and right side.

Other surviving images that originally depicted Amenhotep III are known to have been recarved and reused by Ramses II (e.g. 22.107, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore: https://art.thewalters.org/detail/23612/the-head-of-a-statue-of-amenhotep-iii-re-carved-for-ramesses-ii/). The provenance for the British Museum statue head is uncertain, however suggestions have included Thebes (Hardwick 2003), which is supported by the many other surviving images of the king bearing the blue crown found within the Karnak area (Bryan 2007).
