", " These socketed trilobate arrow-head types are common in the Middle East from the 7th century BC and subsequently in Greece and Egypt (see GR 1909,1201.10 from Naukratis). Shaft-less short socket types were a later development used by the Achaemenid Persians before 500BC, later adopted to become the most common form used in Greece during the 5th century BC (James 2004, 200-201, figs 671-672). There are good parallels from Marathon and Olympia (Baitinger 2001, figs 309-311, Dreifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIB4; Snodgrass 1964, 153 socketed Form 3B3). It was probably used until the beginning or early Hellenistic period. There are also good parallels from Tell Dafana at the British Museum (same shaft-less type BM GR 1935, 0823.108, 1935,0823.107, 1935,0823.95 and very similar short shaft versions BM GR 1935,0823.109, 1935,0823.94, 1935,0823.93) and the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Erdmann 1973, 35 Form CI1, dated to 7th or 6th to 4th centuries BC; Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.7 dated to late 7th to 6th centuries BC).
