This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too. These records also provide a full description of the amulet and list it as an Anubis amulet. Anubis is present in Naukratis through several small amuletic figures made out of glazed composition, like this specimen, or copper alloy (Masson forthcoming). Anubis is often associated to Wepwawet (Upuaut) who is regarded in some Egyptian myths as Anubis son and with whom he is often confused in the late periods. These amulets might be related with the cult of Wepwawet, well attested in the nearby Sais which held a lot of influence over Naukratis (on various cults celebrated at Sais: Weiss 2012, 448-452).
