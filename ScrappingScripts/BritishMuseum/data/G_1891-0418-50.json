In the GR Register, the tablets were attributed to \u2018Curium\u2019 (i.e. Kourion (q.v.)), a provenance repeated for over a century in publications. However in the Register ,\u2018Curium\u2019 was subsequently crossed out and replaced with \u2018Agias Tychonas\u2019 (i.e. Ayios Tychonas), though the source of the revised information is not stated. However, the latter area is likely to be correct as some of the BM fragments join with tablets in Paris which are said to come from Amathus. It is likely that the name of the modern village was confused with the ancient site located on the coast to the south, or that the discoverers/vendor lived in Ayios Tychonas who inhabitants farmed the area of Amathus and also harvested its antiquities.
