The shabti was a figure placed in the grave to carry out any heavy labour required of the deceased in the afterlife. Until the late 18th Dynasty, each burial generally contained only one shabti, and this could therefore be buried individually in small-scale copies of rectangular or mummiform coffins. Later larger numbers of the figures were placed in each burial, and more substantial shabti boxes were devised."}
