Egyptian imitation of Fikellura-ware, made in a Naukratis workshop, as attested by NAA (Hans Mommsen, Bonn). Cook notes in his entry in the CVA BM A, \"opposed triangles are an old motive in East Greek vase-painting and persist till the Vroulian cups, but they are normally set sideways. The cable is probably derived from Fikellura, though used in a different place. Scales become common on East Greek pots in the third quarter of the sixth century (see BSA xlvii, 143). A ridge between the tops of the handles, but much more strongly marked, is a characteristic of a simple type of amphora that appears in Rhodes in the second half of the sixth century (e.g. Clara Rhodos iv, fig. 149). However there is no known close parallel to this amphora, and it is supposed that it was made in the locality of Tell Defenneh.\""], "Bibliographic references": [" CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (Pl.
