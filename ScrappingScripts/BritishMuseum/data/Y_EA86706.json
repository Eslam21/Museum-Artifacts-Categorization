{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86706"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression showing one larger rows of basketry coil impression at the rear, the rest is broken off, but given the parallels above it was quite likely positioned on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of small mica particles and was hardened after excavation. The front shows finger impressions around one complete but eroded seal impression and the edge of another one perpendicular to it. The motif of the seal shows one scorpion along the longer side of the seal, probably a second one facing in the other direction antithetic at the other side.
