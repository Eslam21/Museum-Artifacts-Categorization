{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86960"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is broken into three fragments, bearing one seal impression of an oval scarab-like seal. The back of the sealing shows two flat surfaces, perpendicular to each other, and an uneven part in between that is quite blurred but could show impressions of cord. The seal itself is shallow and blurry itself, showing an uraeus facing to the left, followed by a falcon, followed by another uraeus followed by another falcon with a sun disc and a flagellum. Above the first falcon another unidentified sign, maybe a boat? The same impression can be seen on EA86893 and EA86962.
