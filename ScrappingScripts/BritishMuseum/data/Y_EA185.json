{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA185"], "Description": [" Lower body of a black basalt seated deity. The figure is shown in a seated position and wears a long garment that covers the legs. The right side of the throne includes incised representations of cattle facing in the same direction as the seated figure. The top right edge of the throne is lost, but at the front there is a further column of inscription. Below the deity\u2019s legs on the right side are three short columns of incised text and underneath a relief figure shown adoring the god. The figure wears a short wig, and their arms are raised in adoration. The figure is lost from the chest down. On the opposing left side only a few signs from a similar set of three columns of incised text survive below the deity\u2019s legs, but likely this also included an adoring relief figure. On the reverse are the remains of the back-pillar, with two broad columns of incised text. Only the middle portions of these columns now survive. Much of the throne and left side of the body has been restored, including the deity\u2019s feet. The object is now supported on a tall modern base.
