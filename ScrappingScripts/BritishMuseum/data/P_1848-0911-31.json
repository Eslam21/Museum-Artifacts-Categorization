Hinterding et al. 2000: It was not unusual in the seventeenth century to give existing copper plates a new lease of life by burnishing away parts of the image and replacing them with other scenes. To mention but one example, the publisher Claes Jansz. Visscher took several landscapes with small biblical figures that had been engraved by Jan van Londerseel (1578-1624/5) after designs by David Vinckboons (1576-1632) and replaced the original figures with others in order to market the series again [Schapelhouman 1987, p.152]. Once in his lifetime Rembrandt intervened in this way on someone else's copper plate. At some point he came into the possession of Hercules Segers' plate of 'Tobias and the angel', a free imitation of a print by Hendrick Goudt, the 'Big Tobias', as it was known [Haverkamp-Begemann 1973, p. 65, no.1]. By burnishing parts of the plate, he obliterated the large figures of Tobias and the angel and replaced them with the Holy Family on a considerably smaller scale in a 'Flight into Egypt', against a background of a clump of tall trees. The impression of the second state shows the group containing the Virgin Mary seated on a scrawny donkey and clad in a cloak that completely conceals the Christ Child, with Joseph walking beside the animal [Some years earlier, in 1651, Rembrandt had depicted an almost identical group in a small etching (B.53)]. Rembrandt failed to obliterate the figures of Tobias and the angel completely, however: one of the angel's huge swan wings is still visible in the trees, and in the donkey's back legs we can still make out the celestial being's left foot. The sheer number of states of the 'Flight into Egypt' - seven in total - shows that Rembrandt was not exactly pleased with the work's progress. He repeatedly made small changes, some in pure etching technique and others in drypoint or burin. The most dramatic change to the landscape was the addition of the trees on the right, but in the right foreground too Rembrandt covered Segers' peculiar, rather cabbage-like, plants with deeply etched lines. At the extreme left he added a row of short parallel lines of hatching, probably intending to give the print's left margin a more restful and less ragged appearance. He also charged various details on the horizon, adding a tiny tower in the distance in the fifth state, but removing it again in the sixth. He was evidently also dissatisfied with the group showing Joseph and Mary and the donkey. In the fourth state he worked Joseph's face with a burnishing tool, so that it lights up in its dark surroundings, while in the fifth state it is darker again and in the sixth state the entire group was made lighter by more burnishing. Meanwwhile the copper plate started to show signs of wear. It therefore seems highly likely that Rembrandt had to stop work on this print before achieving a result that satisfied him. 1990 Exhibition Label: \"Rembrandt greatly admired the work of Segers and owned several works by him. In about 1653, he altered the copper plate onto which Segers had etched a Landscape with Tobias and the Angel in the style of Adam Elsheimer. Rembrandt transformed the image into a Flight into Egypt. This rare, early impression clearly shows the section on the right that Rembrandt altered\"."], "Bibliographic references": [" New Hollstein (Dutch & Flemish) / The New Hollstein: Dutch and Flemish etchings, engravings and woodcuts 1450-1700 (271.II) (Rembrandt) ", " Hind 1923 / A Catalogue of Rembrandt's Etchings; chronologically arranged and completely illustrated (266.II) ", " White & Boon 1969 / Rembrandt's Etchings: An Illustrated Critical Catalogue (56.II) ", " Hinterding et al. 2000 / Rembrandt the Printmaker (71.II) ", " Hollstein / Dutch and Flemish etchings, engravings and woodcuts c.1450-1700 (1) (Segers) ", " Haverkamp Begemann 1973 / Hercules Segers: The complete etchings (1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" 1990, BM, Treasures of the Department of Prints and Drawings 2000/1 Jul-Jan, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, Rembrandt the Printmaker 2012 Jan-May, BM, 'Hercules Segers' 2019 7 Feb-4 Aug, BM, G90, 'Rembrandt: thinking on paper' "], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Holy Family"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: W & G Smith"], "Previous owner": [" Previous owner/ex-collection: Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Aylesford (L.58) ", " Previous owner/ex-collection: Samuel Woodburn "], "Acquisition date": ["1848"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1848,0911.31"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 20 Nov 1998"]}
