", " Minute headrests became popular Egyptian amulets during the Late Period (Andrews 1994, 95-96). These amulets were usually manufactured in hematite, as the specimen from Naukratis, or in other dark stones (Andrews 1994, fig. 64e and 95; Petrie 1914, pl. III no. 34). Normally found in funerary contexts, they were supposed to support magically the head of the deceased; for that purpose they were placed at the level of the neck on the mummy, a fragile articulation between the head and the rest of the body.
