{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["1885,1213.58"], "Description": [" Faience three footed bowl of simple hemispherical shape, with three projections jutting from near its base to hold it steady. Three kneeling figures face outward, modelled in the round. They kneel on the flat surfaces of the feet-like props of the bowl, all wearing a garment to the knee, which has pleats indicated by vertical grooves. The figures are bare-chested and each has a beard and hair falling onto the shoulders coloured in black-brown glaze. On the surface of the bowl there are also two lions and an ibex in low relief. The lions have dots along their tails and legs and several longer stripes on body. The ibex is depicted in a conventional galloping way, moving to right. It has dots on legs, in rows along back, on neck and along the horn. There is also a large rosette in low relief slightly raised above the surface at the centre of exterior base between feet. It has seventeen petals, unequally divided by broad incised lines. The centre of the flower is represented by a circular cross-hatched area, with a central dot of more black-brown glaze.

XI no. 268 (with incorrect registration number). This tripod bowl is a rare faience version of a shape better known in gypsum alabaster and generally considered Cypro-Ionian. Alabaster examples are known from Late Archaic tombs in Olbia on the Black Sea where they were found with pottery dated to c. 520\u2013510 BC. The finds from Olbia suggest that such bowls usually had lids and might have been used as cosmetics containers. Further examples come from Naukratis, with feet in the shape of sphinxes, sirens holding children to their breast, or a female head above what appears to be a single lion\u2019s foot. They include examples in the British Museum (e.g. 1886,0401.1508) and have been assigned dates between 575-525BC.
