Both details are incorrect. The only gem mentioned in Percy Christian's letter to Murray recording the discovery of the tomb and its contents was a haematite cylinder seal (GR archives, Original Letters, 26 February 1898). The location of the tomb itself is explicitly said in a letter to Walters the previous day (op. cit.) to have been found '1/2 mile from the place called Bamboula & Vournes in a N. Westerly direction'. This is probably the site of Maroni-Kapsaloudhia (see Cadogan 1992). Also, it is almost certain that the present item, which was purchased along with a bronze bull said to be from a Greek site in Egypt (GR 1898,2-25.1), arrived in the museum before the date it was registered (though coincidently this is the same date of the first of Christian's two letters on the Maroni tomb). According to the Register entry - in H.B. Walter's handwriting - the gem is 'said to be from Amathus, more probably from Maroni'. While the original findspot may have been provided by the vendor, the source of the amendment is not stated, and may have been based on information available to Walters, though it cannot be assigned a firm provenance. The BM catalogue of gems states '[p]robably form Maroni (Cyprus)' with no further information. The gem may well have been found in a tomb at Amathus, though if so it would have been an heirloom or antique. Its findspot must be regarded as uncertain.
