This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The depiction of Bes worshipped by two monkeys is well attested on scarabs and scaraboids, Naukratis included (see Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.676 published in Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 149). Bes holds here a solar aspect, since worshipping monkeys are very often associated with solar symbols such as scarab, obelisk and the cartouche of Menkheperra (Jaeger 1982, 213 \u00a7 1393). B. Jaeger lists other occurrences of this design on convex rectangular plaques and scaraboids, most of which can be dated to the Ramesside Period (Jaeger 1982, 218-219 \u00a7 1408) and he thinks that the stone scarabs which depicts Bes found in Naukratis should probably be dated to this period too (Jaeger 1982, 205 \u00a7 1366, n. 868). However, a scarab in green glazed steatite showing a similar design was discovered in the Third Intermediate Period cemetery at Matmar (Brunton, G. 1948. Matmar, London, pl. LXIII, 108, mainly dated to the 8th-7th c. BC) and another example quoted by Jaeger himself originates from the Kushite cemetery of Sanam (Griffith 1923, pl. XLV, 8). Though Naukratis scarabs could be archaizing copies of Ramesside types, it is more likely that they are genuine Ramesside ones (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
