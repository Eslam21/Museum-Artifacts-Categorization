It is a slender, black-varnished vase, of a type called the Hes vase. It is placed between two wooden pylons, or gateways, the upper parts of which are decorated with a cornice. The whole group is standing on a wooden base. This kind of vase was regularly used in ancient Egypt in libation ceremonies and for ritual purification. Nevertheless, the shape of these objects is still as obscure as their significance. Therefore, Egyptologists frequently classified them as \"magical objects.\""}
