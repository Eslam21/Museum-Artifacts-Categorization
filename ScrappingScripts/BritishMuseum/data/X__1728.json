", " Upright ithyphallic Harpocrates figures of this type were very common at Naukratis and were most likely made there. A number from the same or very similar mould series have been found at Naukratis (British Museum GR1973,0501.34; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, E.113.1914, E.125.1914 and E.126.1914; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, nos 1896\u20131908, E.4764-5 and E.4763; Coulson et al. 1996: 140, fig. 53:9). A similar, but not this mould series, plaster mould is in Alexandria Greco-Roman Museum from a private collection (Seif el- Din 1988, 197, fig. 56 dated to the Roman period). Very similar limestone figure was found at the nearby site of Kom Firin in a mixed slump deposit including Late Period, Hellenistic and Roman pottery, in a primarily late 6th to 5th century BC area (Spencer forthcoming, F274, Trench NA context 0405). Note the Fitzwilliam E.1914 sequence were attributed to \u2018Antinoopolis?\u2019 and the British Museum GR1973,0501 sequence were found unregistered, but that both sequences include numerous terracottas now known to be found and/ or produced at Naukratis of types that predate the founding of Antinoopolis.
