Pawah and his wife, the lady of the house Weret-Nefret, are sitting on chairs with lion's feet. They are wearing the long garments that are typical of the Ramesside Period and their most decorative wigs. In front of them is a table laden with offerings. The children, three daughters and a son, are bearing large lotus flowers and cloths. The style and the names of the depicted persons are clearly of the Ramesside Period, but we do not know where this relief of rather mediocre quality comes from."}
