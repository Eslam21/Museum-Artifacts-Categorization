{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA26265"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Hathor: showing her naked with her legs close together and her arms extended down her sides, her hands flat against the thighs. She has Isis-locks in a double layer back and front and falling on to the shoulders, and wears tightly woven wreaths bound with narrow ribbons. The jewellery consists of a plain necklace, a bracelet on the right wrist, an armlet and bracelet on the left arm and wrist, and an anklet on the right leg; a single breast-chain crossing from the right shoulder to the left waist has an oval fastening above the right breast, with two pendants. All the jewellery is modelled in relief, but a painted ribbon crosses the breast-chain from the left shoulder to the right waist. Details at the rear are well modelled. This figure is restored in plaster from above the knees down. She is of Nile silt and coated in a layer of white gypsum. White dressing over the front only, as is the painted decoration. The hair is black and the jewellery painted brown. Brown paint indicates the pubic triangle, the brows and the outer edges of the eyelids (the inner lids are pink); the irises are brown and the pupils a dark beige. The lips, nipples and the body-ribbon are painted red: the last is narrow, with serrated edges. The breasts and the area above them have a pale-pink wash. Some pink paint survives on the wreath. At the rear are some indeterminate brush strokes in a red paint.
