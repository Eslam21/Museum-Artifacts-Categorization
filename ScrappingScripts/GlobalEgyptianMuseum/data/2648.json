{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1920:275-277", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "PECTORAL", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "7 cm", "Width": "11 cm", "Name": "Pectoral scarab", "Description": "Turquoise-blue glazed faience winged scarab, with holes for attaching to a mummy net. The scarab or dung beetle was seen as an earthly echo of the sun-god, moving as a disk across the sky, and therefore became a symbol of daily rebirth. Large scarabs were placed over the heart from the Middle Kingdom, and pectorals incorporating the scarab are known from the New Kingdom. The faience winged scarabs appear in the Late Period as part of sets of amulets attached to bead-net mummy-coverings."}
