Sealing published: Martin, Egyptian Admin and Private-name Seals (1971) cat no.1843 [pl. 43.12]. The sealing from the box is published by Petrie, Lahun II (1923), pl. 64 [198] as coming from a box containing an infant burial (p. 4, 41). However the slip of paper in the box suggest that it is one of the boxes found close to the king's pyramid with offerings inside (p. 12), although it cannot be identified with any on his pl. 14 (nos 1-3). It could be one of the other offering boxes from Lahun (p. 12, nos 4-7), of which the best candidate is perhaps no. 6 from the south-west deposit: this had a sealing, published as pl. 64 [199] (= Manchester 6199). Perhaps there was some confusion between sealings and boxes as the finds were distributed?"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair (repaired)"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egyptian Research Account"], "Acquisition date": ["1914"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA53942,a"], "Registration number": ["1914,1012.5"]}
