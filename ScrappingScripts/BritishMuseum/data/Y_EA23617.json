Scarabs with a lion motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45). This scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 95-96, type XXVIII A, subtype A49-72, especially A50 for this piece).
