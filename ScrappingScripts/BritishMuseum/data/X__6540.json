", " The sherd joins Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA87. The fabric from the sherd with the sample number 'NAU 34' written in ink was analysed by P. Dupont at the Centre de recherches arch\u00e9ologiques, laboratoire de c\u00e9ramologie and the results determined that the clay from that sherd originated in Chios (Dupont and Thomas 2006, 78-9). However, Dupont identifies NA88 as the sherd analysed, but the photograph is not of the same sherd and 'NAU 34' is not labelled on NA88. Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice.
