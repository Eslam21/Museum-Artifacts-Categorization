The body, hairy, and the right hind leg occupy most of the surface. The right fore arm is bent, the hand on the knee, and is reduced to a thin line. In the same way, the head, although easily recognizable, is much reduced, which accentuates the disproportionate, but very elegant aspect of this representation. The reverse consists only of a spiral edge and the sign neb (\"lord, all, each\").   "}
