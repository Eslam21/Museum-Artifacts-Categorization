The inner concave surface bears part of a negative impression of a cartouche of a king Psamtek; the outer convex surface bears a positive impression of another cartouche, possibly the same one. The sealing should have belonged to a second layer of plaster which was covering a first layer already stamped with a cartouche (see EA 23791 coming from the same findspot). The cartouche is vertical and surmounted by a solar disc between two ostrich feathers.
