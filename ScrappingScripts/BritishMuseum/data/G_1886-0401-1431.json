{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1431"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Apis bull. Only small part of head survives of what was probably an Apis Bull bust. Very little survives: horns, an eyebrow and the place where the right ear is broken away. The horns rise up from the top of the head, the right one lacking its tip, as does the left horn, but this is damaged at its junction with the head. The sun\u2019s disc is embraced by the horns, and bears on its face, in relief, a bust of Helios with a radiate crown. The rear is summarily treated. Hollow, from a two-piece mould. Covered with an overall white dressing and bearing considerable areas of post-firing colour at the front: the bull\u2019s head and horns are painted yellow, the flesh parts of Helios are pink, and traces of blue paint survive on the crown. Red-brown Nile silt with a brown surface and grey core. Fine gold mica and white inclusions visible.

An Apis protome from Memphis has a head of Sarapis on the disc between the horns, dated 1st to 3rd century AD (Fjeldhagen 1995, no. 174; Kater-Sibbes and Vermaseren 1975, fig. 43). An example from the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, (no. 1975.364) has a disc decorated with a star-like rosette between the horns. However this is finer than the Roman period examples and Bailey suggests a Ptolemaic date for it (Bailey 2008, 181, BM Terracotta IV; Walters 1903, C 589; LIMC v (2), pl. 641, Helios 154).
