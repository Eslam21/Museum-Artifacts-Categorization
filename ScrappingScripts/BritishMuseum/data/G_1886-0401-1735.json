Poor preservation makes identification difficult. If correct Baitinger suggests this type was developed from Mycenaean forms that continued to be used into the Hellenistic period (Baitinger 2001). The Archaic form developed out of Late Bronze Age Greek and Cretan types and is associated with composite bow. This form was also found on the battlefield of Marathon (Snodgrass 1964, 145-7, boss and barb tanged \u2018Cretan\u2019 type Form 1C2; 1967,81, fig. 35; Erdmann 1973, 35 Form B1, 1200, 7th-1st centuries BC).
