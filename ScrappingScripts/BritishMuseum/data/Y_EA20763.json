Though many chairs have lion heads on the ends of their arms, or other two-dimensional relief elements on their backs and sides, there seem to be no examples of small separate sculptures like this. Two recumbent lions flank the headrest of Tutankhamun, thereby magically protecting the head of the king, but similar examples for non-royal persons are unknown. This might have been just a small free-standing sculpture that would magically protect the owners in whatever context it was made, either domestic or funerary. Comparison of this statuette with the massive Soleb lion of Amenhotep III made for a temple (BM Big number 2), illustrates the Egyptians' mastery of animal sculpture of all sizes. Bibliography: N.
