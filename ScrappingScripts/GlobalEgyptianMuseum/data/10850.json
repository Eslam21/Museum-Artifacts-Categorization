{"Present location": "PELIZAEUS-MUSEUM [04/030] HILDESHEIM", "Inventory number": "1677", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD (not after); 30TH DYNASTY (not before)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; SCULPTURED", "Height": "55 cm", "Width": "13.5 cm", "Depth": "12 cm", "Name": "Large Osiris figure", "Description": "This divine mummiform figure is probably one of those known as Ptah-Sokar-Osiris figures. This is suggested by the slits in the figure which once held certain attributes. On the head, a feather crown with ram's horns and a solar disk was inserted into the impressive long wig. The chin was fitted with the typical divine beard which curves at the tip. The torso has been modelled only summarily without indications of other body parts. Because no traces of plaster or paint remain, it is possible that the piece was once gilded, either entirely or in part."}
