{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure fragment of a protome: head of woman, top of head covered by sphendone. The fine modelling of the eyes and mouth have produced a naturalistic appearance. The curvature of the upper lids, which rise more suddenly at the inner than at the outer end, incline downwards rather than upwards at the corner further from the nose. Bold treatment of the wavy hair, parted in the middle, with tresses hanging down at each side of the neck so as to conceal the ears. Part of veil remains attached to left side of her head. The high head-dress was added after the head had been removed from the mould. The huge frills are probably an artistic development of the sphendone/stephane, providing a background for the head. Mould-made and hollow. Traces of white coating, and paint preserved. Heavy and coarse dull red-brown Nile silt fabric, with large gritty inclusions, overfired. Broken back, sides and cracks on face and headdress.
