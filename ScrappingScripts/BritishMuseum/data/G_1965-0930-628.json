The fabric, shape, and exterior pattern find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). The interior decoration finds parallels with Vallet and Villiard's Ionian Cup Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Schlotzhauer type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.153) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.628"]}
