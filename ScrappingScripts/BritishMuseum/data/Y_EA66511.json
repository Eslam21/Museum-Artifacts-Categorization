This specimen belongs to Gorton's type XXXIV, which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, see esp. subtype XXXIV B for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122). This type of representation has a parallel in Archaic Greek gems (e.g. Walters 1926, pl. VIII, no. 450).
