Like this piece, they especially belong to the class of Tridacna squamosa (see also BM 1886,0401.1594, BM 1886,0401.1597), but also mother-of-pearl (BM 1886,0401.1595) and large conical shell (1886,0401.1598).

", " Originating from the Red Sea, tridacna shells probably acquired their elaborate designs in the Syro-Palestinian region; their production is dated to the period of ca. 630-580BC (Stucky 1974; Brandl 2001). They were widely distributed particularly in the East Greek world, including Samos, Miletos, Rhodes and Cyrene (Stucky 1974; Furtw\u00e4ngler 2011). Unworked tridacna shells are also reported among finds from the cemetery of Naukratis (Gardner 1888, 29). Most examples of worked tridacna shells have been found in sancturies of female deities, but examples are also known from female tombs on Rhodes (Filimonos-Tsopotou and Marketou 2014, 70) Brandl, B. 2001, 'Two Engraved Tridacna Shells from Tel Miqne-Ekron', Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, 323, pp. 49-62.
