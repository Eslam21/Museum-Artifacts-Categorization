It is an early work, in which the figures still show a certain stiffness and awkwardness. Other impressions are in Bologna (Pinacoteca Nazionale), Florence (Biblioteca Marucelliana) and in the Rothschild collection (Louvre, Paris). For a discussion of Robetta's oeuvre see Hind D.II.4 (P&D Kk.8.30). The composition is copied (in reverse) from Schongauer's 'Man of Sorrows' (Bartsch 69; Hollstein 34), although Schongauer's Gothic frame and the angels above are omitted. The representation of the sudarium (the cloth miraculously bearing an image of Christ's face) is analogous to that in Robetta's signed 'Resurrection' (Hind D.II.15; M. J. Zucker, 'The Illustrated Bartsch, Commentary', vol. 25, part 2, 1984, p. 545, no. 018). From its dimensions and shape the engraving was possibly engraved on the same plate of the 'Flight into Egypt' (Hind D.II.38; M. J. Zucker, 'The Illustrated Bartsch, Commentary', vol. 25, part 2, 1984, pp. 539-40, no. 013)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Hind 1938-48 / Early Italian Engraving, a critical catalogue (D.II.39) ", " TIB / The Illustrated Bartsch (25.2521.024) ", " Hollstein / German engravings, etchings and woodcuts c.1400-1700 (34 f) (Copy after Schongauer) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["christ as man of sorrows"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: St John the Evangelist ", " Representation of: Jesus Christ ", " Representation of: Virgin Mary "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: John Heywood Hawkins"], "Acquisition date": ["1847"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1847,0227.1"]}
