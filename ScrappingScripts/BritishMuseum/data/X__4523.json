", " Though they appear already in the 18th dynasty (Andrews 1994, 81-82), wadj-column amulets are especially well attested between the 26th and 30th dynasty and persist in early ptolemaic contexts (Petrie 1914, 12; Wilson 1982, 31-32, pl. XXIX n\u00b01-2; Giddy 1992, pl. 49, 78/284, pl. 53, 78/86, pl. 77, 78/284; Masson forthcoming; see also numerous Late Period references in Herrmann 2006, 228-229, KatNr. 440-446, Pl. XCIX C). Such amulets are usually associated to ideas of regeneration and youth (Andrews 1994, 81-82; Germond 2005, 24). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised by) Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
