{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M13927", "Dating": "12TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STELA", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "INCISED", "Height": "99.5 cm", "Width": "56 cm", "Depth": "2.8 cm", "Name": "Stela", "Description": "A round-topped limestone stela belonging to Sobek-sat. The stela is divided into one large and fifteen smaller registers, with four long and five short horizontal, fifteen vertical, bands of inscription which are incised. In the arch of the stone are two udjat-eyes, with only a rudimentary appearance of falcon-like markings. Below these is the large register depicting the deceased seated at left before a large table of offerings, and holding a lotus flower. Sobek-sat appears to be wearing two linen garments, the longer one tied about his chest and covering a shorter kilt. In front of this register, and in the registers below, are the figures of friends and family, both male and female. The two females and one male opposite the deceased have small offering tables before them. The other figures are simply holding a flower and have a small bowl and stand with them.The technique is fair and no colour has survived. The style of the workmanship is provincial and is not of the highest quality. "}
