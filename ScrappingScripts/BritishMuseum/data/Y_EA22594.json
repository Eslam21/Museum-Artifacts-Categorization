Colour was of symbolic significance in Egypt and was used by the ancient craftsman to identify and define the essential nature of things. It is clear that the colours used in the manufacture of this piece are not accidental. The brilliant yellow, a substitute for gold, was associated with the life-giving sun and the flesh of the gods. Blue, the colour of the central inlay, was employed in lieu of lapis lazuli, a powerful stone symbolic of the heavens and cosmic waters. The vibrant red, the colour of cornelian, was connected with concepts of birth and destruction. Bibliography: R. H.
