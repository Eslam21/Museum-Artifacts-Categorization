The caves together are around 30m long and 6m high. The cave mouth is about 50m up a very steep white sand and rock slope below a cliff. The cave opens on the inside with a curved back wall and a domed roof. On the left, a wide step about 2m high carries the first cave into a further domed chamber with a circular rear wall. The cave contains engravings of animals and big cat pugmarks as well as pigmented handprints and was discovered in 1995 and excavated by Barbara Barich. The site was further explored and discussed by Alec Campbell in 2005."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Alec Campbell"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Wadi el-Obeid "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.100"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYWEO0010007 (TARA number) "]}
