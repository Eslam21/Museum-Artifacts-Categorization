{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA73588"], "Description": [" An animal-shaped spout, broken from a terracotta vessel, apparently the head of a harnessed horse, but very stylized, with a long tubular muzzle acting as a spout: possibly a cockerel's head. The basic head was wheel-thrown, with a domed end; the muzzle was hand-modelled and applied. The eyes are rounded knobs of clay added to the head, the eyeballs defined by the use of a tubular tool; the small ears were pinched-out. The crossover harness was then applied. Red Nile silt with a grey core and some white inclusions, the outside covered overall with a cream-coloured slip; red-brown fired-on ceramic colours on the harness, eyes and ears.
