", " Padibastet (Petoubastis) is a royal name for three pharaohs between the 23rd and 26th dynasty, as well as a common private name during the Late Period (Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 283). This name is commonly found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 117-118; on the various productions of the factory, see Webb forthcoming). They belong to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 103-107, type XXVIII B, see especially subtype B16-23 for this piece).
