Porter & R. Moss, 'Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings' V (Oxford: Clarendon Press), 28-9). A temple of Ramesses III is attested there, and one of Hati's titles indicates that there was a construction of Ramesses II at Thinis as well. This statue may have come from Thinis or possibly Abydos where objects bearing references to Thinis have been found (B. Porter & R.
