On the recto, Akhenaten is drawn in profile looking towards the right. Apart from the \"amarna\" characteristics, one notices also the short wig, indicated by means of extremely precise details, and the absence of the royal uraeus. On the verso, only the tip of the nose, the lips and the chin of the king's head are preserved. Traces of black and red lines give evidence of the sketching done on the stone before the carving."}
