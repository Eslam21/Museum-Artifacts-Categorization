Even though this piece is not listed in Gorton 1996, versions of the same inscription, but using the hieroglyph of the duck to write the word son are very well attested at the Scarab Factory (Gorton 1996, 102, type XXVIII B24). The detailed hatching within the feather is similar to the treatment of hieroglyphs found in Gorton's type XXXVI (Gorton 1996, 129-131). It is also quite close to her Phoenician type XV (Gorton 1996, 43-8, see especially fig. 8 no. 2 and 17). The hieroglyph of the egg is used during the Late and Ptolemaic Periods to write the word son, while the Maat feather is used to write the name of Ra (Gorton 1996, 102). Another possible reading would be 'Amun is my lord', if we follow Drioton's interpretation for very similar inscriptions (Drioton 1957, 22, no. 57-58).
