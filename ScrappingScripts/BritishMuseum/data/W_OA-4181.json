New York, 217. ", " The legend reads from the second line to the first, a familiar feature of later Arabic epigraphy but one which occurs on no other glass stamp of an identifiable Umayyad or Abbasid official. The weights of this type present a problem. The British Museum's piece is of an excellent weight for a d\u012bn\u0101r weight but Balog's at 2.80g, conforms to that of the early dirham weights. But if the same die was used to produce weights on both standards the users would have had difficulty in telling them apart. Perhaps the weights of these two specimens conform to the different standards by coincidence and the pieces are tokens, like the disks of varying weights on which the legend consists of the name \u02bfUbayd\u0101ll\u0101h b. al-\u1e24ab\u1e25\u0101b. One the other hand, two specimens of a type with only the name of Us\u0101ma b. Zayd weigh 2.86 and 2.83g. remarkably close to each other and well within the usual range for early dirham weights (Petrie 1926, 88; Miles 1951, 26, 2). More material is required before it can be decided whether all these types are tokens or not. Bibliography: Petrie, W.M.F. 1926. \u2018Glass stamps and weights\u2019.
