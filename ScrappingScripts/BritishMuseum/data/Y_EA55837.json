It may conceivably be a receipt without a date; but it seems unlikely that receipts, except by an accident, would be issued without a date, and on the whole it is most probable that it was a note of the destination and, in most cases, nature and amount, of a consignment, sent with it as a check on full delivery. ", " This ostracon is probably complete, but the ink on the left side is so faint as to be illegible. It is therefore not certain that it is an invoice and not (e.g.) a receipt, beginning with a date. It mentions the same place as 1923,0327.49 (O.Sarga 194).
