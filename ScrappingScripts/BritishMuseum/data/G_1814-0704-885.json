{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1814,0704.885"], "Description": [" Forepart of terracotta figure of elephant. A front fragment of a figure of a tusked elephant standing on a low plinth, the skin shown by a series of striations. The body is lost from behind the ears and front legs, and the end of the trunk is broken away. Hollow; apparently made in a two-piece mould, but the panel between the front legs may have been applied separately. Orange-red clay, probably a Nile silt but not certainly so, with some mica. Red-brown slip overall.
