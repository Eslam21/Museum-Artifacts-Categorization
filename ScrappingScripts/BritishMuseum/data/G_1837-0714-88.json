A squatting male being, his legs bent double and his feet widely splayed, reaching forward to grasp the root of his huge phallus with both hands. His features are slightly grotesque and he is bald but for a band of hair encircling his head (except for his brow). His arms are thin and have a curious ridged, segmented appearance, as though wearing many bracelets, but probably representing malnutrition to add to his ugly apotropaic demeanour. Between his wrists is his distended stomach. The back is very summarily modelled and much is lost; there may have been an applied suspension-lug between the shoulders. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, covered with a brown slip. Traces of a white dressing, particularly on the head and neck.
