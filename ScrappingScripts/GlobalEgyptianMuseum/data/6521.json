The three figures are standing, with their left foot set forward in order to simulate a walking motion, are holding hands. The figures on both sides wear a headdress while the one in the middle is bare-headed. The figure on the left wears the red crown of Lower Egypt and the one on the right wears an elongated headdress that is flat at the top. Possibly these images are Isis and Osiris holding Horus by the hand (?). On the flat reverse side of the amulet there is a slightly chiselled suspension ring."}
