It is notable for its fine lines and strongly contrasting colors, however, the tempera paint that was used could not give a three dimensional impression, which is usually the result of using encaustic paint. The encaustic technique involved fixing the prepared colors with wax by heating. Tempera paint is made by mixing pigments with an adhesive material that is water soluble, such as egg yoke. It is noticeable in this portrait that the eyes are dull and expressionless, and that the proportions of the face are awkwardly rendered; the nose is rather long in comparison to the oval face."}
