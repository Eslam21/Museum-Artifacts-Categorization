", " Clazomenian kraters and dinoi are unslipped on their interior and they were more common during the early phase of Clazomenian black-figure pottery period when white slip was more popular. For other examples, see Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.54.e.1899, GR.54.a.1899, GR.54.b.1899, GR.54.c.1899, GR.54.f.1899 and GR.300b.1899. E.R. Price (East Greek Pottery, 1927, 22) argued that white slip Clazomenian pottery was the link between the Clazomenian sarcophagi, which were covered in a white slip, and the later Clazomenian black-figure wares. She explained that the features (the use of white dots as well as the use of white lines together with incised lines for inner details) on the white slip sherds are paralleled either the sarcophagi or the later vases. Cook (1952 note 64) rejected that argument on the basis of both dating and styles. The sherds listed by Price in her argument were tentatively identified by Cook as British Museum 1888,0601.575 and possibly Oxford AN1896-1908-G.130.10. A third sherd was mentioned by Price and described as having a cock as decoration. Cook subsequently incorrectly identified the sherd as 1886,0401.1197 which is an Attic black-figured column-krater. His CVA reference is also incorrect because CVA British Museum VIII, pl. 589, no. 9 discusses a Milesian Fikellura amphora. The sherd first mentioned by Price may be Oxford AN1896-1908-G.131.1 which is a Clazomenian black-figure plate with a cock in the tondo. In all three cases, the styles are very different, the dates do not match and 1888,0601.575 is not Clazomenian.
