{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86712"], "Description": [" Almost complete seal-impression with two rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side string impressions that were not cleaned before the object was hardened, showing that this piece was probably positioned on the lid of a basket. The extremely fine brown Nile clay has mica inclusions and shows blackening from fire on the back. The top is finely smoothed and uneven from the sealed object. One oval scarab-like impression is visible, showing three standing figures. The one on the left could be falcon headed and shows remains of hieroglyphs above his head. The middle figure shows Amun wearing a double feather crown. The figure on the right is not well preserved and therefore could be a third deity or pharaoh. The same motif (but probably not the same seal) was used on EA86716.
