Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Dome-shaped scaraboids, or circular plaques, are a standard production at Naukratis. Petrie published one example similar to this piece (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 18). Gorton, A.
