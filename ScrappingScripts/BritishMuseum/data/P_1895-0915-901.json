It is one of a number of preliminary drawings for this painting (for another see Oo,7.135). The present drawing records the completed landscape, albeit in reverse. This method of working out the setting prior to the addition of the figures was used by Claude across his career. He does however appear to have started to draw in the figure of the Virgin the lower right corner. There are two small characterful sketches of faces on the verso that appear to have been made on a whim. Lit.: A.M.
