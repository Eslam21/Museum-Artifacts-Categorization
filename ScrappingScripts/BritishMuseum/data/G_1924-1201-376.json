The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which bears the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure. The interior decoration is more elaborate than the usual Simple Animal Style decoration. The numbers 841b and 840 are written on the interior surface in pencil. The sherd might belong to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.493.f. A number of Chian chalices from Emporio (Lemos no. 1468) and Rizari (Lemos no, 1487) depict komast dancers alongside female figures dressed in long chitons and playing the double flute and tambourine (or possibly holding a wreath). Occasionally, the female figure is holding a pomegranate. On some chalices, the female figures are incised whilst on others, they are depicted in outline. The figures on the sherds from Naukratis are likely to be from similar scenes interpreted as dancers following and performing with a chorus of women."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
