This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The shape of the cup is typical of Hera cups from this period. However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has a graffito. Similar cups have been found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera. Despite this, both the crude slip and the rather coarse fabric are typical of Samian Hera cups and so this mug may have been produced on Samos. Edgar did not publish a complete reading of the inscription, which was corrected in print by Schlotzhauer. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405. For parallels regarding South Ionian mugs, see Boston 88.930. Following Furtw\u00e4ngler's typology of Samian Hera cups, the sherd belongs with his Type I-III (Furtw\u00e4ngler, A.E. and Kienast, H.J. 1989, Samos III: Der Nordbau im Heraion von Samos, Bonn, 88, fig. 14).
