", " The pieces listed above are all vessel stamps. The edge of the impression of what appears to be the same die can be seen on the edge of two weights in the Balog collection, a half-ra\u1e6dl of al-Man\u1e63\u016br and a wuqiyya of \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. \u02bfAl\u012b. Balog (1976, 724a-7) has argued that Abb\u0101n may have been active towards the end of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br's Caliphate and even in the early years of that of al-Mahdi, on the grounds that the script of the stamp is identical with those of al-Muh\u0101jir (qv). The resemblance, however, is hardly very striking and such a late date conflicts with Abb\u0101n's association with \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. \u02bfAl\u012b, which implies that he was active in the early part of al-Man\u1e63\u016br's reign. There is reason to think that the few heavy weights issued in the name of that Caliph are to be dated to the earlier period (see OA+ 4295 and OA+ 4359). Castiglioni published an engraving of a curious d\u012brham weight with an executive's name which it is tempting to read Abb\u0101n b. Ibr\u0101him. The first two lines read 'amara al-am\u012br/a\u1e63la\u1e25ahu all\u0101h' ('ordered the Amir/may God keep him righteous'). The benediction is one used by a number of officials, among them \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25 b. \u02bfAl\u012b. It may be that he was the nameless Amir of the pieces, if indeed the name is not omitted in the printed engraving by error.
