A winged sun-disk is at the top of the stela, below this is a single horizontal line of text, sandwiched between two narrow bands of decoration. The paint has been considerably worn away and the traces of inscription are now extremely faint.The main register is divided into two, separated by two columns of text. To the left is the deceased adoring the standing figure of Re-Harakhty, the scene is reversed to the right. In both scenes a low altar stands between the figures, over which is an open lotus blossom. The god holds a was-sceptre and wears a short kilt. Wedjrenes wears an ankle-length tunic. Above the figures are eight short columns of text. Below the scene are another seven lines of text which appear to make up a prayer to the sun as well as other funerary formulae."}
