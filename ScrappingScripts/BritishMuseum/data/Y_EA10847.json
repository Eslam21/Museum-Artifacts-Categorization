Kaplony-Heckel mentions, p. 85, that one of the other texts was closely related (same scribe, same deity etc.), but that she did not include it in her publication because its contents were unclear. This is probably this text. On the god addressed, cf. Zauzich, Enchoria 4 (1974), p. 163. Teephibis is the deity worshipped at Kasr el Aguz, but this may not be the provenance of these texts, as internal evidence from one of the oracle questions makes it likely that they come from Hermopolis."], "Bibliographic references": ["Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (69682) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/69682)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Papyrus Survey: Condition Details: Papyrus: brittle, deposit Black ink Tabbed: kraft paper Mount Details: Sandwich: glass Binding: self adhesive tape Object Priority: B Mount Priority: C Overall Condition: B Curatorial condition comment: fair"], "Acquisition name": [" Purchased through: B A Seaby Ltd ", " Purchased from: George Anastase Michaelides "], "Acquisition date": ["1977"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA10847"], "Registration number": ["1977,1105.2"]}
