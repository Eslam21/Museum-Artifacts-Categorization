It has been suggested that this new shape - an Amarna innovation - reflects a change in the function of the throwstick from a hunting implement to a ritual baton or club. Each side is with painted decoration showing a lotus-flower.

To bring down their prey these ancient hunters used throwsticks, some of which resemble the modern boomerang; others were fashioned in the form of snakes. The meaning of these hunting scenes remains debatable. A number of scholars interpret them as representing leisure activities that the deceased wished to continue in the afterlife; others see them as charged with religious symbolism. In Egyptian art and religion, for example, swamps had highly erotic connotations. Similarly, rhe Egyptian word for throwsrick (gm\u0292) is very similar to that for \"beget\" or \"create,\" so that fowling scenes may have been intended to insure procreation and fertility after death. Whatever the meaning of such scenes, there is no doubt that fowling in the marshes played an important role in the lives of many New Kingdom rulers. In two Eighteenth Dynasty royal tombs (of Tutankhamun and Ay) paintings depict their royal subjects dispatching birds with throwsticks, and Amenhotep II and Tutankhamun were buried with wooden examples undoubtedly used in actual hunts. Some royal throwsticks, however, certainly had ritual meaning. Inscribed examples in blue glazed composition, which could not have survived being thrown, are known for almost every monarch of the Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties. Bibliography: G. T.
