", " Pataikos might be related with the god Ptah as a craftman god (Andrews 1994, 39). He is definitely linked with the other dwarf god Bes, with whom he appears often on the same amulet or in the same context (on the relationship between these two gods: Bult\u00e9 1998, 379 and 382). As an amulet, Pataikos seems to appear as early as the 6th dynasty, although amulets of the dwarf god are better identified from the New Kingdom onwards (Andrews 1994, 39). His amulets are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (as illustrated in Mendes: Wilson 1982, 32, pl. XXIX n\u00b03-4) and as popular as Bes in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming).
