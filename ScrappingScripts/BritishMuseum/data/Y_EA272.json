{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA272"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Paneb: a small rectangular stela divided into two registers. All figures are carved in sunk relief and all texts are incised. In the upper register on the left the foreman Paneb is kneeling with arms raised in adoration before a coiled serpent on the right, doubtless the goddess Meresger. In the lower his son, the workman \u02bf\u0292-p\u1e25ty, his son P\u0292-nb and his son Nb-m\u1e25y(t) are shown kneeling in a similar attitude of worship. The stela is in a good state of preservation apart from some scratches on the surface and chipping around the edges. There are no traces of colour.

He is first attested as a workman in Year 66 of Ramses II. He began to prepare Tomb 211 when still a workman. He became chief workman between Years 1 and 5 of Sethos 11 and is last attested in office in Year 2, probably of Siptah. He was most likely disgraced and removed from office at the end of the Nineteenth Dynasty, although the exact date is uncertain. No son of his named Paneb is elsewhere attested. Similarly, Nebmehyt is not otherwise known as a son of Paneb, but it appears from offering-table 22037 in Turin that 'Apehti had a son Nebmehyt and thus he too may be a grandson rather than a son of Paneb.
