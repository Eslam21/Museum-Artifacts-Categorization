", " Bronze figures of Harpokrates were common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods in Egypt (Weiss 2012, 126-157, Typ 41-69, Pl. 11-19), chiefly in the Delta where his cult was particularly developed (Sandri 2006). Likewise, the child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). A relatively similar figure, with crude and flat rendering, was discovered in North Saqqara (Davies, Smith2005, 124, pl. LXV b; Weiss 2012, 594, Pl. 15e, Nr. 281).
