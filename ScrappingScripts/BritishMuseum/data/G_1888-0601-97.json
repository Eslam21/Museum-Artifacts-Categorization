{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.97"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure leaning on shield. A cleruch leaning on a Gaulish shield with a central spine. He is dressed mainly in civilian garb, a short belted tunic with sleeves, but with a chlamys fastened at the right shoulder and draped over his left side, an end of which trails over his wrist to dangle over the top of the shield. His right arm is akimbo, the hand resting on his waist. The left leg, much hidden by the shield, is lost below its edge, and the right leg is bent at the knee: he may wear a high boot. He is clean shaven, with the hair brushed back above and falling at the sides, with small bunches below the ears: he may be a Gaul, although cleruchs of other ethnic groups used the oval Gaulish shield. The plinth is broken away and the back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow, from two-piece mould, with minute traces of white dressing on the front. Brown Nile silt with abundant fine gold mica, and occasional white inclusions.
