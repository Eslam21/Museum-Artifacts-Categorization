{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.8290", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FLASK", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "10.7 cm", "Width": "5.5 cm", "Name": "Phial", "Description": "This phial in terracotta, elongated and with a flat belly, ends in a rather high neck, which is provided with a handle. The form belongs to the phials coming from Asia Minor, but the motif which is repeated on the two sides is without any doubt egyptian. It represents a person standing, wearing a roman military costume. Its canine head could indicate that it is Anubis, but the attibutes which the person holds in his hands (the flagellum and the sceptre) are rather rare for the god of Assiut."}
