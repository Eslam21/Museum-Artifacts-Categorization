{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA777"], "Description": [" Basalt scribal statue of the male official Ameny, shown cross-legged on top of a slim rectangular base. He wears a shoulder length striated wig, set low on the forehead and tucked behind his large ears. His eyes are small and narrow, with a thick upper eyelid and arched eyebrows modelled in raised relief. His nose is large and broad at the tip, while his mouth is wide with a sharply incised lower lip. His chin is raised and suggests an upward gaze. His upper body is bare, with subtle modelling of the chest and a slightly narrowed waist. He wears a long kilt wrapped at the waist that envelops his lower body, with a visible loop of knotted material at his right side and a diagonal line of the edge of his clothing extending over his legs. His hands are also placed flat across his legs. Along the top of the statue base in front of Ameny is a short hozirontal line of incised text. A portion of the front left edge of the base is now missing and there are some small chips across the hands and arms of the figure.
