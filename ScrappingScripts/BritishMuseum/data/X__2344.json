", " Winged mythological creatures, either a lion or a horse here, are very popular on scarabs and scaraboids at Naukratis (on this production, see Webb forthcoming). It is depicted here in a rather hellenizing style. This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, see especially C13 for this piece). Though the back is a bit eroded, it is possible to recognise a Black African head rather than a Bes head (Gorton 1996, 126, C13). For similar scaraboids from Naukratis see: Petrie 1886, pl.
