It is one of a group of similar figurines characterised by a front part made in a mould and a smooth back part. They are also characterised by a forceful modelling of the legs and the clear contrasts between the parts of the face. The recent study by G. Nachtergael places the fragment into the 2nd or 1st century BC. The figurine was probably a household cult statue that could be used as an ex-voto in a sanctuary or a tomb."}
