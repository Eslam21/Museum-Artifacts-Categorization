", " Petrie mentioned 'necks of \"pilgrim-bottles\" of fine yellow paste', but did not publish them; he suggested that they were produced at Naukratis, like the scarabs and scaraboids manufactured in a similar material (Petrie 1886, 37). New Year\u2019s flasks are very common during the 26th dynasty. When cartouches are incised on the body of the flasks, they always refer to pharaohs of the 26th dynasty, especially Apries and Amasis, or to the Divine Votaress Ankhnesneferibre (God\u2019s wife of Amun from around 586 to 525 BC) (Caubet and Pierrat-Bonnefois 2005, 148-151, no. 398). Specimens discovered outside Egypt seem to originate from 7th-6th century contexts (Caubet, Pierrat- Bonnefois 2005, 151). However, recent excavations provided a few examples from later contexts. They are attested in late 26th-early 27th dynasty contexts (Masson 2007, 614, pl. XXVII) and in Persian contexts at \u2018Ayn Manawir in the Oasis of Dakhla (Wuttmann et al. 1996, 429-430). These flasks, offered as a gift for the New Year, were possibly meant to contain the water of the Nile as it rose at the beginning of the flood season.
