{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1282"], "Description": [" Limestone false-door of Neferseshemkhufu: at the top, the lintel carries a conventional offering-text in favour of the deceased (here called \u0160\u0161\u1ec9), and below it there is a panel with representations of Neferseshemkhufu and of his wife, Khentetkai, each seated behind an offering-table. A single line of text with titles separates the upper panel from two lower panels which flank the false door. These latter panels bear representations of Neferseshemkhufu and his wife: on the left Neferseshemkhufu is shown standing and holding the sceptre and staff of office, accompanied by a child, his son \u0292bdw; on the right Khentetkai is shown with her daughter Nb-\u1e25zt, who holds a lotus-flower. The whole is carved in good sunk relief. No remains of colour.
