{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA792"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Wentawat: this round-topped stela with slightly sloping sides is divided into two registers of scenes carved in sunk relief accompanied by incised texts and below them four horizontal lines of text. In the upper register Osiris is depicted in the centre seated on a throne, and behind him stand \u1e24r-n\u1e0f.\u1ec9t.f, whose name is strangely written, and Isis, each with one arm raised. In front of Osiris are two altars, each bearing a water-pot cooled by a lotus-flower. On the right stands the first prophet of Amun of Ramses and viceroy of Kush, Wentawat, with his arms raised in adoration. The second register shows six people, five adults and one child, in an attitude of worship: the lady of the house and chantress of Wepwawet, T\u0292-wsr(t), her [son], the stable-master of the Residence, N\u0292-\u1e25r-\u1e25r, his brother, the first prophet of Amun of Ramses, 'lmn-w\u0292\u1e25-sw, his sister, the chantress of Wepwawet, \u0292st , his sister the chantress of Wepwawet, T\u0292-\u02bf\u1e33y, and a child, T\u0292-wsr(t), whose relationship to the others is lost. At the bottom of the stela the incised text contains a prayer to Osiris, Isis and Horus on behalf of the stable-master of the Residence, Naherher, and his father, the first prophet of Amun of Ramses, Wentawat. This stela is in a poor state of preservation and much worn. Part of the last line has been lost subsequent to the taking of the photograph used here. There are traces of red paint on the hands and face of the lady Tausret.
