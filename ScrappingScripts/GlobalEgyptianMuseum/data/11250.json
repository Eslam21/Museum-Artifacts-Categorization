The man is wearing a short-sleeved garment over an ankle-length kilt. His head is missing but his wig must have been a short type. The woman is dressed in a long dress and a plain long wig. The outer arms of both figures are placed on their thighs, but their other arms are around each other. The carving is summary which indicates that the details were originally rendered in paint."}
