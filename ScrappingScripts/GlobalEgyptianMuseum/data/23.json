{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "ACO.Tx.0313", "Dating": "COPTIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "AKHMIM ?", "Category": "COPTIC TEXTILE", "Material": "FLAX; WOOL", "Technique": "WOVEN", "Height": "42.5 cm", "Width": "27.5 cm", "Name": "Fragment of a tunic", "Description": "This fragment of a tunic consists of three pieces - a linen ground with clavus, a part of the same clavus sewn horizontally onto the fabric, and a roundel which originally belonged to another tunic. The three pieces are authentic but the arrangement is modern. The clavus is decorated with angels apparently swimming among lotus flowers, a goat, a thin-stalked flower and a hare. The roundel shows a bearded man in military costume holding a sword in his right hand and seizing a small nude figure by the hair in his left. He is flanked by two figures, an angel on his right and a man with his right arm raised on his left. This scene has been interpreted as the sacrifice of Isaac but it could equally well depict the Massacre of the Innocents. The ensemble may be dated to the seventh to ninth centuries."}
