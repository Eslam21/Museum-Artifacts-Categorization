{"Present location": "INSTITUT DE PAPYROLOGIE ET D'\u00c9GYPTOLOGIE, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LILLE III [02/049] LILLE", "Inventory number": "L 316", "Dating": "GERZIAN", "Archaeological Site": "AKSHA/SERRA WEST", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "58 cm", "Diameter": "37,7 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Deep and narrow jar with a pronounced shoulder, small neck, thick lip and rounded conical base. Its colour varies from light pink to buff and was not covered with a slip. Slightly asymmetrical, the irregular surface is strewn with blemishes as a result of firing. A depiction of a bird perched on a branch (?), a 14 cm high motif, has been engraved on the smoothened upper section of the body. The interior of the neck bears a series of three vertical incisions diametrically opposite each other. Like many others, this vessel, which was found in an  A-Group tomb, demonstrates the importance of trade between Upper and Lower Nubia towards the end of the Predynastic Period in Egypt. Vessels of this type, called ''wine jars'' by researchers, were used by the Egyptians to transport food products to Nubia. They were thereafter used by Nubians, who appreciated the technical qualities of the vessels and did not hesitate to place them in their tombs."}
