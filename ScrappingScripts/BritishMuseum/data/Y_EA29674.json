It is very probable that this cartouche was found there. It is because of this possibility that so wide a date range has been assigned. Otherwise, a date late in the Eighteenth Dynasty would be suggested. Limestone blocks at el-Amarna were inlaid with glass frequently even on the great scale of this cartouche."], "Bibliographic references": ["Cooney 1976 / Glass (873)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: R J Moss & Co"], "Acquisition date": ["1897"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA29674"], "Registration number": ["1898,0312.81"]}
