{"artifact_name": "textile; hair-net", "Object Type": [" textile ", " hair-net "], "Museum number": ["EA53911"], "Description": [" Hair-net made in a sprang technique from wool yarn of three colours, red, yellow and dark green, arranged in groups of four threads of each colour to form stripes. All the yarn is two-ply (SS/Z-ply); the green yarn is thicker than the other two coloured yarns. The mesh is formed from rows of 1/1 interlinking alternating with 2/2 interlinking. It is tapered towards the top by combining groups of threads and is seamed at the sides in matching red wool sewing thread. The brow-band is woven in plain weave from red wool yarn and is attached to the net in red wool thread. At one end of the band there is a finger knot with added green and yellow threads, which is possibly the remains of a tied-on drawstring that would have formerly passed through the loops at the back of the net.
