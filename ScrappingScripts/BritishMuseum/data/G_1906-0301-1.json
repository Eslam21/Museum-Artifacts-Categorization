{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1906,0301.1"], "Description": [" Flat limestone figure rudimentarily carved, certainly representing a horseman. The animal has a large body and a very small head separated from the chest only by a vertical groove, while the neck is only characterised by the curve of its upper contour. Fore legs, thighs and hind legs are broken and lost. The rider is only suggested by a hump in the middle of the back in the shape of a triangle rounded at the top, with pairs of short horizontal notches scored on the front part of the sides.
