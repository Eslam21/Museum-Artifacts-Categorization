Its shape is that of an alabastron, a vase for fragrant oils. It is a typical product of the Late Period. The narrow shoulders and the two opposing knobs on the upper body of the vessel are characteristic elements. The knobs represent the knots of a linen cord. Instead of the usual slender shape, the body of this alabastron widens into a rounded base. On one side of the jar, four matching inscriptions have been incised. In between the knobs are three superimposed lines of cuneiform writing in Old Persian, Elamic and Akkadian. Beneath them is a cartouche with hieroglyphs rendering the name \"Xerxes, the great king\""}
