It shows a similarity to a fragment depicting Maat now in the collection of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Firenze (Inv. no. 2469), which has been attributed to the opposite jamb. Recent work on the reconstruction of the tomb including 3D scanning and survey of relief in museum collections has been undertaken by Factum Arte: https://www.factumfoundation.org/pag/1502/the-tomb-of-seti-recording-and-facsimile ", " This fragment would have been part of a larger scene showing the pharaoh before the gods of the afterlife. The royal tomb of Sety I, from which this relief fragment derives, is the deepest and longest in the Valley of the Kings. It is richly decorated with painted reliefs as well as extensive texts: the first tomb to be decorated with a complete program of religious texts, including the Litany of Ra, Book of the Dead, Amduat, Book of Gates, and Opening of the Mouth ritual.
