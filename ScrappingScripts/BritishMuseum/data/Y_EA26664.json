{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA26664"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta camel, modelled in the round and standing on a low plain plinth. Details of the head-harness are indicated in relief, as are three girth straps, although the load, a domed bundle, is shown in paint. The right hind foot and part of the plinth are lost. Two-piece mould; striations (probably post-moulding but pre-firing) show hair on the neck. Micaceous brown Nile silt, painted over much of the surface with a white dressing, except for the spaces between the legs, which are black, together with the top edges of the plinth. All the applied colouration is probably post-firing, but not certainly so. The harness, on the head and neck, the eyes, the edges of the load, its strapping and girths are all picked out in black. Other strappings of the load are painted pink and yellow. Pink is also employed on the mouth, in a stripe round the animal's throat, and in horizontal bands round its lower legs. Yellow paint is used on the plinth and between the two black harness-straps on the neck.
