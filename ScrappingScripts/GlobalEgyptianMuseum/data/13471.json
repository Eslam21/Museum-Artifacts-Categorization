{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "4817", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "29 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a man", "Description": "The statuette represents a man with his left foot advanced. He wears a short pleated garment and a spherical wig leaving only the lobes of his ears exposed; a wide collar is painted on the neck. The arms that had been originally pegged to the body are lost. The front part of the body is badly damaged, but the face and the polishing of the preserved parts testify to its rather high quality. The style and some parallels allow to date the statuette to the first half of the Eighteenth dynasty."}
