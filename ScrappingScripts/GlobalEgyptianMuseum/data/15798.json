Ani sits on a folding chair, wearing a long pleated gown with sleeves, a wig, a pectoral, or large piece of jewelry worn on the chest, arm rings, and sandals. Behind him is a portrayal of part of a tomb facade. In front of Ani is a table of offerings of food and flowers. On the right, his servant stands, offering his master a large jar of wine. Ani's name is written on the extreme left. His official titles are also written on the stela: \"the true scribe of the king, his beloved, the scribe of offerings of the Lord of the Two Lands, head of the provisions, Ani.\" The artistic style, with the narrow eyes of the servant and the shape of the back of the head, is typical of the Amarna period."}
