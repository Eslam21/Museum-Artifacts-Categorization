", " The sherd probably belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1888,0601.483. Written in ink on interior: 'Temple of Aphrodite, Naukratis, Egyptian Expl. Fund, 1888'. Lemos describes the sherd as belonging to the Group with the Filling Ornament. The features typical for this group of vessels are the milky white slip and the use of filling ornament, which is found only in this group of sherds of the Grand Style. The male figures portrayed on vases from this group are perhaps the most expertly depicted and may all have been done by the same hand. Finally, the attempt at creating some perspective is rather clumsy. It ought to be pointed out, however, that there is no evidence for filling ornament on this sherd.
