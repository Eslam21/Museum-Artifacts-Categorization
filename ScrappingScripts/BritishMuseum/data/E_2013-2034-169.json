The ostriches are infilled, with well-defined edges and pecked and rubbed infill. They stand in the centre of the image, the smaller to the right of the larger. To the right of this is the figure of a quadruped with a long, tapered horn sweeping back (scimitar- horned oryx?). The human figure has arms outstretched sideways and the pecked Barbary sheep appears as if leaping from the human figure\u2019s left arm. To the upper right are two long pecked, infilled legs of an unidentified animal cut off the edge of the image at the joint.
