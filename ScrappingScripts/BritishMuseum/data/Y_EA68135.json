{"artifact_name": "scraper", "Object Type": ["scraper"], "Museum number": ["EA68135"], "Description": [" One of three pieces of an oval scraper, found separately and now rejoined: the scraper was made from a thick flake of dark brown flint, flaked all over one side and retouched along the edges. During manufacture, a large flake separated itself from the butt, carrying with it part of the sharpened edge, and a smaller flake became detached from the worked surface of the implement. The reconstituted scraper has a large bulb of percussion at the butt.
