", " The sherd probably belongs to the same vase as Cambridge Fitzwilliam GR.48.1894 and GR.50.1894. Lemos describes GR.48.1894 and GR.50.1894 as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration. If so, then GR.49.1894 is also of the same style. However, it must be pointed out that Lemos places this sherd in the Mature Animal Style Williams suggests that the painter of this vessel also painted British Museum 1888,0601.475.g, 1888,0601.475.d and 1924,1201.115 and was closely related to the Painter of the Aphrodite Bowl.
