", " Archaic East Greek protome of late Archaic date (broadly 550BC to 480BC). The fabric is similar to that of figurines of an East Greek origin. Often identified as \u2018Rhodian\u2019 though numerous production places are known across East Greece. Parallels from Lindos, Rhodes, of Type A1 dated \u2018late Archaic\u2019, after 525BC (Blinkenberg 1931, 591, pl.116, nos 2463 and 2465). A number of fragments from the same type of protome may come from the same piece (Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology NA452, NA761 and possibly NA831; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR.8.1899; British Museum GR 2011,5009.275). Similar protomes were found on Samos (Tsakos 2007, 194, pl.26.2, third quarter of the 6th century BC) and from Olynthus (Robinson 1952, 73-4, pl.1-3, nos 1-2, 6th century BC). This type falls into Croissant's Aeolis and Clazomenae protome types, dated between 540 and 510 BC (Croissant 1983,164 nos 82-3 and 95-107, Types F4 and G3). For context, function and details on protome parallels and fragments from Naukratis see protome records from Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA350, NA355, NA354, NA353, NA390, NA850, NA426, NA803 and NA509).
