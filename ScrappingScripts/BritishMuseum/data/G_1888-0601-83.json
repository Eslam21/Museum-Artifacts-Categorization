A sealing impressed by an intaglio gem, with a naked figure, possibly a woman (there is a fairly obvious breast) but not certainly so (male genitalia also seem present), standing half crouched to left, the left arm extended, the right hand raised in the pose of a wrestler about to engage with an opponent; in relief behind her are the letters upsilon and lambda. The sealing is almost circular, with cracked edges and a flat back: there is no evidence for its application to anything. Orange-brown Nile silt.
