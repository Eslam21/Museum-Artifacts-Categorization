Around the damaged centre are small vignettes, each with one or two figures in them, presumably members of the deceased's family. The male figure at top left is standing, the female opposite at top right is seated on a chair. Below them on either side the figures are all kneeling, with one arm across the chest. The women all wear long wigs while the men appear to have shaved heads.At the bottom are 16 short vertical columns of text."}
