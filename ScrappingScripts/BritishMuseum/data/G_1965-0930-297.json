The lead vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which has the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Simple Animal Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily, and carelessly, in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Simple Animal Style group display a mixture of techniques, with female figures portrayed in outline and dancing komasts in black-figure."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1100) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition notes": ["Previously unregistered."], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1965,0930.297"]}
