{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA24704"], "Description": [" A plastic terracotta vase in the form of the face of a young satyr, with a forehead-band decorated with two small blooms. At each side of the hair is a large circular flower with a raised centre; a ribbon apparently extends from the flowers, passing behind the ears and under the chin, and has three large pendent ivy leaves, two immediately below the flowers and one below the chin. A further ivy leaf rises from the top of the head, its point reaching to the mouth of the vase. The rear is plain, and an applied basket-handle crosses over the mouth. Two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt. White dressing on the front; yellow paint on the mouth of the vessel and between the three ivy-leaf pendants. The lower pendant also has yellow paint and the other two a blue-green paint.
