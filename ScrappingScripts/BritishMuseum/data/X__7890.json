", " Dome-shaped weights are very close to the cupcake-shaped ones; they just do not show a sharp edge, or strong carination. Such type is one of the most common weights found in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201cdomed\u201d type), and elsewhere in Egypt (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25-26, fig. 26). Dome-shaped weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples. This specimen however is linked to another standard which is difficult to define. It could be associated to the unit value called beqa, weighting between 12 and 13 g (even almost 14g: Petrie 1926, 17-18, pl. XI-XII). This standard was used between the Predynastic Period till 300 BC (Lassen 2000, 233). This very stable standard, also known as the golden deben, was used to weight gold or other precious metal. This specimen could correspond to \u00bc of a beqa. Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989. Les poids dans l\u2019\u00c9gypte ancienne, Vols. 1-3 [unpublished thesis, microform], Paris.
