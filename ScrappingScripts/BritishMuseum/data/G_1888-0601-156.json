{"artifact_name": "vessel-stamp", "Object Type": ["vessel-stamp"], "Museum number": ["1888,0601.156"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta circular stamp. A circular bread-stamp (?), with applied elongated grip on the centre back. It has an incuse pattern: within a border of short radiating grooves enclosing a narrow wreath, is a bull\u2019s head to front, with a fillet tied across its brow, and a dewlap indicated below the muzzle; a solar disc is shown between the horns: probably the Apis Bull, but other sacred bulls are possible. Made by pressing over a modelled form. Red-brown Nile silt, with abundant gold mica and white inclusions; the surface has fired buff, either salt-induced, or a slip.

Very similar Ptolemaic stamp of bull with sun disc, in same clay, at the Petrie Museum (UC65088). Also a similar stamp dated 3rd-2nd century BC from nearby site of Kom Firin (Besques 1992: 129, D4549). Amphora stopper stamp. Such objects are commonly described as cake or bread stamps (Petrie 1886; Bailey 2008). However, such an interpretation is called into question by the presence of plaster in the grooves of many examples found at Naukratis, as if used to stamp the seals of amphora stoppers. Others were used to produce decorated terracotta discs, likely used as amphora stoppers (Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). This is confirmed by the presence of a stamp from Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl. xxix; Bolton Museum 1886.31.35) used to stamp a design on a terracotta disc stopper from the same site (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964) and not bread or cake. A number of such terracotta and stone stamps (Alexandria, Greco-Roman Museum 9710; British Museum GR 1888,0601.157, GR 1886,0401.1768, 1886,0401.1367, 1888,0601.156, 1886,0401.1370, 1886,0401.1369, 1965,0930.896, 1965,0930.895; Bolton Museum 1966.94.A, 1886.31.35; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts RES.87.298, 88.912, 88.914, 88.916, 88.917, 88.913, 88.911, 86.667, 86.666, 88.915, 86.665, 86.664, 86.663; Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum, H2241; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, GR.46.1887, GR.45.1887, GR.44.1887, GR.43.1887, GR.42.1887, GR.41.1887; Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology, NA732; NA731, NA730, NA729, NA728, NA727, NA726, NA725, NA724; Liverpool, World Museum 9,9,86,57, 9,9,86,56; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4568, AN1886.517, AN1886.516, AN1886.515, AN1886.514, AN1886.513, AN1886.512) and the stoppers produced by them (Munich, Bavarian State Collection of Antiques 5310; Hamdorf, Knauss, and Leitmeir 2014, E 964; Bailey 2008, 3612, 3611, 3609,3608, GR 1886, 0401.1368; 1886,0401.1373; 1886,0401.1374). are known from Naukratis.
