{"artifact_name": "lamp", "Object Type": ["lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA79651"], "Description": [" An unusual object of pale red siltware pottery, with a pale cream-grey surface slip. The item consists of a hollow stem with a rounded element at one end and decorative ridges around the perimeter. There are three raised ridges, each of which is double, with thinner incised lines in between. Possibly part of the stem from a lamp. If this suggestion is correct, the sides at the bottom of the piece would have continued their expansion to create a stable foot, whilst above the round element at the top a dish for the actual lamp would have existed.
