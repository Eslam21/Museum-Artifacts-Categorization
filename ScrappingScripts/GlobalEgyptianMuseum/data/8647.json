{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "1999/99/6", "Dating": "19TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GRANITE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "24.4 cm", "Width": "27 cm", "Name": "Head of a lady", "Description": "This head of a lady possibly belonged to a double sculptural group. The female head is highly idealised; it is topped by a three-part enveloping wig marked with incised stripes recalling hair. The face is rounded and very flat if seen side-on. The eyes are small, almond shaped and with hardly any cosmetic line. The full-lipped mouth sketches a slight smile. The person accompanying the lady in this sculptural group was placed to her right and might have been her husband. There are no inscriptions to tell us the woman's name."}
