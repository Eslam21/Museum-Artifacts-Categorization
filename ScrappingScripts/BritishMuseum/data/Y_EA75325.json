{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA75325"], "Description": [" Fragment of papyrus bearing four fragments of three different Coptic texts, possibly stuck together for use in bookbinding. The first text from the top has 5 lines preserved. The other two texts are harder to distinguish: one (text 3) preserves 6 lines in two different pieces, placed upside-down to and overlaying the other text, which also preserves 6 lines. The other side resembles a patchwork, with very faint traces of Coptic text on a few components. EA 75325, 75324, 75323, 75322, 75321 are mounted together.
