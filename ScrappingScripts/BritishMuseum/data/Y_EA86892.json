The rear shows a concave surface with very clear impressions of a wooden object like from a bolt, perpendicular to it two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.2 cm in the break. The front has a small flat area with downwards bent sides. On the flat area parts of an oval scarab-like seal-impression. Visible is a thin circumferential line around two probably originally three standing gods. In the centre Amun with the double feather crown facing to the right, only head and shoulders are preserved. To the right another standing god, facing towards left, maybe Re-Harakhte with a sun-disc above his head and above the disc a horizontal line.
