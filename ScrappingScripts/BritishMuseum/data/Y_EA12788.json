{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA12788"], "Description": [" Fragment of a limestone trial piece. On one side the torso and legs of an animal are carved in raised relief, most likely depicting a bull or horse. Faint lines across the front leg indicate its musculature, and across the top of the neck is a lined pattern of sectioned hair suggesting the animal's mane. On the opposing side of the stone are traces of an incised proportional grid. The edges of the trial-piece have been damaged, and the lower portion of the stone has been lost. The trial-piece is currently supported by a wooden frame.

The possible mane and the elongated neck, as opposed to a slight hunching of the back which is often present in representations of bulls, may indicate that this represented another animal. Due to the damage, it is difficult to determine the original size of the trial-piece. It was found at Karnak, however its precise findspot within the complex is uncertain. It was possibly donated to the temple as a votive offering, which became a wider practice in the first millennium BC."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair (incomplete)"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA12788"], "Registration number": [".12788"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.12788 (Birch Slip Number) "]}
