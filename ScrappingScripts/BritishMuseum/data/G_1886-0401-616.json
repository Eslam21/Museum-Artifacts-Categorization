However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has a graffito. Other similar mugs have been found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405.
