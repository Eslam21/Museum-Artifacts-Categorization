{"artifact_name": "painting", "Object Type": ["painting"], "Museum number": ["1890,0801.2"], "Description": [" Fragmentary portrait of a woman in tempera on wood, inscribed in Greek 'Serapi[as]': only the left edge of the panel is preserved with sand and mastic on the back. Visible are the proper right ear, the lower lid and part of the pupil of the right eye, the nose from bridge to nostril and part of both cheeks. In her pierced ear the woman wears a gold hoop earring threaded with pearls, of which two are visible. Above them two corkscrew locks of black hair hang in front of the ear. The flesh is warmly tinted in tones of cream, apricot and rose pink with an ochre-green shadow by the nose. The nostrils are drawn in dark red.

The name Sarapi(as), unknown in other mummy portraits, is well attested, for example in six papyri naming members of the 6,475 descendants of the Greek settlers in the Fayum. Bibliography: R.
