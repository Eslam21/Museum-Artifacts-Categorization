For the drawing of the floral elements and the proportion of lotus to palmette, see Basel, Antiken museum in AJA 60 (1956), pl.75 fig. 34-35, which Benson, in AJA 73 (1969), p. 120, no. B 1a, attributes to the manner of the Memnon Painter. The Louvre E 630 sherd (in Payne p.154, fig. 62c; NC 1181D) is attributed by Benson in AJA 73 (1969) p.120, D2, to the Detriot Painter.
