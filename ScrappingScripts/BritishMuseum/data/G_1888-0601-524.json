The kylix has also been attributed to the Arkesilas Painter (Shefton 1954). There is no unanimous interpretation of the scene on the interior of the vase. The figure holding the pomegranate has been called Cyrene or Persephone, the seated male being correspondingly Apollo or Hades. Cook saw the whole scene as a \u201cmemorial to the divinised dead\". Cook, A. B., Zeus I. Cambridge 1914, 95. A totally different interpretation was put forward by Hampe, who explained the scene as the Judgement of Paris, Hera approaching with the apple. Hampe, R., Corolla Ludwig Curtius. Stuttgart 1937, 145, no. 10. Pipili argues that the seated/enthroned figure on vase B6 is much more likely to be a god receiving offerings from worshippers, since the pomegranate, being a chthonic symbol as well as a symbol of fertility, should not be used per se as an indication for the funerary interpretation of the scene (Pipili 1987, 61). She also believes that the vase would have been left in the sanctuary of the deity represented on the vase (Pipli 2006, 79).
