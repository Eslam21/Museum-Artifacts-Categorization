{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA65660"], "Description": [" Fragment of a vessel: apparently with globular body in opaque white glass (probably opaque only due to core), the surface having a low gloss. The blue and white impressed decorations are unique in Egyptian glass. Strands of prefabricated purple-blue and white glass in the pattern of blue rectangles impressed into a white field were arranged to form registers of continuous loops. Within each loop was impressed a central 'eye' of the same blue and white. Portions of only three registers are preserved but they appear to have been graduated in scale apparently increasing in size towards the base of the vessel. In cross-section the blue and white strands are clearly a half-circle. This suggests these strands were made on a metal wire and then were sliced in half though it is possible they were moulded. Thin white core.
