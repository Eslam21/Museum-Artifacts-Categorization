", " The amulet Papyrus British Museum EA 10732 is written for the protection of Amennakhte, born of Tarekh\u00e2nou, against the srf-inflammation (fever). The text is very close to P. Chester Beatty VII verso 7, with some variations in text and images. A partial doublet of P. Chester Beatty VII, verso 7 has been published by Yvan Koenig (Papyrus Deir al-M\u00e9d\u00eena 42). The nature of the relationships between P. British Museum EA 10732 and P. Chester Beatty VII, verso 7, is discussed. The amulet EA 10732 offers a case quite interesting study, in that it reproduces, to some notable variations, a text as present in the model note consigned to P. Chester Beatty VII, verso 7 (EA 10687), of which a partial doublet exists on a third papyrus (PDM 42).
