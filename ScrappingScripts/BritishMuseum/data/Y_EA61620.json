{"artifact_name": "votive offering", "Object Type": ["votive offering"], "Museum number": ["EA61620"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta bust of an Apis Bull, with disc between horns; the disc has an uncertain device in relief, a damaged boss. Two patterns often appear on the disc, a uraeus or a head of Sarapis: neither is evident here. A garland or collar hangs from the roots of the ears, with an uncertain pendant on the neck, perhaps crescentic. The back is plain. Two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface. The overall white dressing is much worn. Traces of pink paint are found within the ears, above the brow and on the garland.
