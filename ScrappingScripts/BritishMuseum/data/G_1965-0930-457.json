However, unlike Hera cups which have dipinto dedications to the goddess, this cup has a graffito instead and the fabric is finer. Other similar cups were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and thus this shape is not exclusive to Hera. For parallels with Hera cups, see British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888, 0601.402, 1888.0601.403, and 1888,0601.405.
