{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1892:387", "Dating": "ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "KOM OMBO/OMBOS", "Category": "RELIEF", "Material": "SANDSTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "23 cm", "Width": "34 cm", "Depth": "4 cm", "Name": "Relief with hieroglyphic inscription", "Description": "Sandstone relief from Kom Ombo, the cult-centre of Sobek in the southernmost province of Upper Egypt. The hieroglyphic inscription includes the name of a Roman Emperor in cartouches. The signs are partly effaced, but perhaps record Claudius, one of the several emperors attested at the Kom Ombo temple. Although the name of the Emperor is still written in a cartouche in hieroglyphs, beginning with the word Caesar, the irregular spacing and proportions of the signs contrast with fine royal and temple relief of the Pharaonic Periods."}
