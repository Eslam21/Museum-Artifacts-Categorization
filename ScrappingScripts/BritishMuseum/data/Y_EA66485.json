This scarab was attributed to a type which was distributed in the Mediterranean area, especially in Greece and Punic sites (Gorton 1996, 129-131, type XXXVI, subtype 16-22, see especially 21 for this piece). By the techniques used in its production, the size of the scarab, the shape of its back and the inscription on its underside (giving the name of Amun-Ra), it is closer to the scarabs belonging to Gorton's type XXVIII B: see for example BM 1886,0401.1660 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.865.
