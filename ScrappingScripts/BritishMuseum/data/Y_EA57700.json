{"artifact_name": "spacer-bar; bracelet", "Object Type": [" spacer-bar ", " bracelet "], "Museum number": ["EA57700"], "Description": [" Gold spacer-bar: from a bracelet, made in the form of a flat box enclosed at the ends and open at the sides. Twelve tubes run across the width of the box between upper and lower plates, rolled from incompletely joined strips of gold. There is a roughly scratched inscription on the base which lies between two horizontal lines. On top of the box recline three cats with heads erect and facing forward, their bodies lying to the left. Their back legs are stretched out in front of them, and their front paws are crossed. The legs are all made from beaten wire. Beaten notched wire tails curl around in front of the legs. The heads and bodies were probably not cast but made by hand; details were added with roughly-cut lines. The faces have details of eyes, noses and mouths and a rather smug expression; the ears were added separately. "], "Cultures/periods": ["17th Dynasty"], "Findspot": [" Excavated/Findspot: Edfu (?)
