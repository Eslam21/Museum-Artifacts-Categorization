{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA17014"], "Description": [" Brown pottery pilgrim-flask with circular body, the neck is damaged and one handle is missing, the exterior is covered with a grey-coloured slip. On each side, within a plain border, Saint Menas stands to front, flanked by camels, his arms outstretched in blessing. Above his arms on side (a) are crosses; on side (b) are groups of chevrons. He has curly hair, and wears a short tunic: his cloak is only visible in its drapery across the shoulders. The saint and the camels are so close, one to another, on both sides, that a single archetype must have produced their moulds, but the differing devices above the arms point to alternative manipulation of the moulds.
