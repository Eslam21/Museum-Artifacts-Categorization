{"artifact_name": "hanging lamp", "Object Type": ["hanging lamp"], "Museum number": ["EA38244"], "Description": [" Bronze hanging lamp of Egyptian manufacture: deep oval body, rounded underneath, with three legs like those of an animal, two of which are largely lost, the other one bent. The body is truncated at the narrow end, with a slanting termination, leaving a wide, open wick-rest. A broad moulding runs round the body, which has a rabbet above the moulding to accommodate the top of the lamp. The top of the lamp is loose, forming a lid, with a ring-handle, and, at its rear, it has a low square sleeve with a moulded top edge, which runs up and down the suspension stem. Parts of the lower edge of the lid are broken away. At the rear, a tall, square-sectioned stem rises up, slants slightly forward, and terminates in a suspension hook in the form of a duck's head. Surface colouration: green, with areas of bare metal.
