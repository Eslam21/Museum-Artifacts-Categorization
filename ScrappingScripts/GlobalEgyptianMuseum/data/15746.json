For funerary purposes, vases were painted to imitate the floral arrangements that such vessels held during festivals. These oval examples with tall necks, two handles on each vase, protruding lips, and rounded bottoms are decorated only on one side. The painted design in red ochre, dark green, light green, and white, has been added hastily on a layer of pale slip, or thinned potter's clay used for coating ceramics. The effect is vibrant and spontaneous and the variegated bands enliven the decoration."}
