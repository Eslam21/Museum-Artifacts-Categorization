{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA480"], "Description": [" Red quartzite stelophorous statue of Amenwahsu: Amenwahsu kneels with hands raised, palms up, in the attitude of worship. His hands are supported by a stela bearing a prayer to the sun-god Ra-Horakhty. The same deity, now combined with the great state god Amun, is depicted in the lunette at the top as a man with a ram's head, crossing heaven in a barque. The stela-shaped back pillar of the statue is inscribed in mirror image with two offering formulae, one addressed to the composite sun-god Ra-Horakhty-Atum, and the other to Osiris, god of the dead. Considering the hardness of the stone, the carving is particularly fine.
