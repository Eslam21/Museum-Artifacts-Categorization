Six fragments from Tell Dafana in the British Museum (BM GR 1888,0208.92.a, 1888,0208.92.b, 1952,0505.22, 1952,0505.23, 1888,0208.105.a, 1952,0505.24) are from belly-amphorae with panels containing the head of a bearded man or of a horse. Cook suggests that these fragments may belong to as few as two amphorae. The fragment Philadelphia E154.1, also from Tell Dafana, is from a similar amphora or from one of these amphorae (Cook CVA British Museum 8, p. 43)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B129.1.1) ", " CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (Pl.
