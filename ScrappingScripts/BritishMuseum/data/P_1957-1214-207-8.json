The figure of St Catherine on the recto is after a painting of the Holy Family (cropped) by Bonifazio Veronese now in the Prague Castle. G. Adriani proposed that the Virgin and Child at the top of the verso is after a lost drawing by Titian. The sketch at the bottom of verso is after Titian's painting 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt'. Wethey suggests that Van Dyck would have seen the it in the Casa Pietro Assonica in Padua, where both Vasari and Ridolfi recorded it (Vasari, 1568; Ridolfi, 1648, I, 194).
