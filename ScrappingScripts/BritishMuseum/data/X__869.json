", " This type of Isis is unique in the corpus of bronzes from Naukratis. It was discovered in the cache of bronzes in a building located in the southern part of the town (Petrie 1886, 41-42). The cache was probably made around the late 5th-early 4th c. BC, but some bronzes from this cache could be earlier in date (Masson 2015). Bronzes representing members the Osirian triad \u2013 formed by Isis, Osiris and Harpokrates, are conspicuous in Late Period and Ptolemaic bronze votive deposits all over Egypt. Statuettes of winged Isis, however, belong to a rare type (Weiss 2012, 245-247, Pl. 36d-f, Typ 139). Bar one example from Sais, a few other examples originated from the Memphite region (Weiss 2012, 701-702). Masson, A. 2015, \u2018Cult and Trade.
