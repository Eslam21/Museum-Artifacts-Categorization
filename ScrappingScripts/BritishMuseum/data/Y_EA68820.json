{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68820"], "Description": [" Limestone squatting figure, possibly representing an animal or bound prisoner. The figure is crudely carved and appears to be depicted in a squatting position, with rough indications of the head, arms, and legs discernible at the front and both sides of the figure. The arms are held close against the body with hands placed on the knees, with the legs parallel but set slightly apart from one another. Deep ridges at the face of the figure roughly indicate the eyes and mouth, and further carvings across the top of the head could be intended to convey a wig. The lower body of the right side features a deep vertical ridge that could possibly be intended to depict the tail of an animal, though there is no clear indication of the base of a tail on the reverse. There are various small chips across the surface, and a notable abrasion across the top of the head towards the reverse. The base of the figure includes a handwritten note in pencil of an earlier inventory number.

These are relatively rare at Naukratis and highly variable in form, with a selection of other prisoner figures now held in various museum collections (see list in Thomas 2015: 27, n. 261). \u2018Rude stone figures\u2019 were recognised by Petrie to be a local, early production, dating to the 6th \u2013 4th centuries BC (Petrie 1886); these have since been dated more specifically to c. 620 \u2013 400 BC (Thomas 2015, also provides a further list of comparable examples from sites including Saqqara, Tell Dafana, and Herakleion). A possible female prisoner figure from Naukratis made from terracotta is now held in the Museum of Classical Archaeology (Cambridge, NA494). Other possible captive figures from other contexts at Naukratis are also in the British Museum collection (such as EA 68824 (1886,0401.1492) and 2011, 2011.7). Animal figures in limestone and terracotta such as baboons and sphinxes are also known from Naukratis, and these vary greatly in quality (Thomas 2015). A possible parallel to this figure, though of higher quality, is a sphinx now in the Ashmolean Museum collection (Oxford, AN1886.458). Other parallels to sphinx figures and apes have also been found at other sites such as Memphis. Further Bibliography: R.I.
