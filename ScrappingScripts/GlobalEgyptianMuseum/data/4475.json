The face and neck are painted red with the wig and features in black. The projecting pleated kilt panel on the front of the figure distinguishes it from the normal shabti figures, the arms are folded and are without implements, later a whip would reinforce the distinction between the overseer and worker. The text is in black down the front of the kilt and legs but is very faded and illegible.The back of the figure is plain."}
