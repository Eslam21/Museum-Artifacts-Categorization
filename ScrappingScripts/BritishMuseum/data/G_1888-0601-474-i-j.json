In the first instance, the interior decoration is very elaborate for the Chalice Style, but typical for the Grand Style. Secondly, the rim pattern decoration is also commonly found in the Grand Style. Thirdly, whilst sphinxes are not a typical figure found on Grand Style vessels, the use of white for flesh is connected with the Grand Style. For parallels regarding the interior decoration, rim pattern and white for flesh, see British Museum 1888,0601.508.
