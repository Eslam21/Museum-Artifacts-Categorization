Besides OA+ 4160, there are two dated types of AH 114 (Fahm\u012b 1957, 9) and 115 (Miles 1948, 10a described on p. 79. Cf. Miles 1964, 4) and a fifth type represented by a single defective piece (Balog 1976, 68). On this last there would seem to be room on the missing lower part for a date. On the present piece, note the curious division of the word 'ilbn' between the second and third lines. Bibliography: Fahmi, A. 1957. \u2018Sinaj al-sikka f\u012b fajr al-Isl\u0101m\u2019.
