They are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. They occur for example at Bubastis, Tanis, Zagazig, Sais, Saqqara and Memphis (Wallert 1967, 53). As demonstrated by J. Bult\u00e9, the general theme displayed on offering spoons is often associated with the act of offering or with the offering itself (Bult\u00e9 2008). This fragmentary specimen belongs to a common type representing a bound bovid. This type was manufactured in various materials, in stone (slate or schist), in bone or ivory, in glazed composition or blue Egyptian (Bult\u00e9 2008, 9, pl. VI). This example is made out of steatite (first published as made out of schist: Gardner 1888, 87, pl. XIX, no. 8). A complete specimen figuring a similar theme and made of green schist was discovered in Naukratis (BM 1888,0601.76). It is an archaizing copy of a New Kingdom model, that can be dated to the 26th or, latest, 27th dynasty. According to the British Museum's register, it was discovered within the Temple of Aphrodite, in the 5th stratum.
