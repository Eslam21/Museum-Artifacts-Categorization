The ram relief itself is similar to the arms of limestone or terracotta thrones common in the late CA to early Hellenistic periods (Coenaerts and Samaes 2006, with further references). These usually support an image of the horned god (variously interpreted as Baal-Ammon, Zeus-Ammon or a Cypriot deity using the iconography of these foreign deities (Sophocleous 1985,.58-69; Buchholz 1991; Counts 2008; Kleibel 2007).
