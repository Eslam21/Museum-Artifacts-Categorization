This figurine is labelled in pencil with a faint \u03a68 on the left side of the horses snout (however the first character is faint and unclear, and on the back is another pencil mark that appears to read K1), designating this as coming from a context excavated by Petrie within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, during Gardner\u2019s excavations at Naukratis in 1885-1886.
