{"artifact_name": "vase", "Object Type": ["vase"], "Museum number": ["EA47983"], "Description": [" Twin-handled jar of slightly elongated proportions: the body is opaque dark blue, a colour found again on the handles, one of which is incomplete. On the neck is a chevron pattern in opaque yellow and white, colours which are repeated in the loose festoons of the body. An interesting technical detail, also present on a few other vessels, is a register of shallow indentations directly above the upper level of the body decorations.

One of the rare examples of a glass vessel found in a modest burial of the New Kingdom. Within the Eighteenth Dynasty at least, glass vessels seem to have been restricted chiefly to the court circle.
