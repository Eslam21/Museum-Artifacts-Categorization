{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1912:197", "Dating": "1ST DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "TECHNIQUE OF CERAMICS", "Height": "19 cm", "Diameter": "9 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Piriform pottery vessel, with rounded base, sides gently inclining out to the shoulder, sharply inturned to the narrow neck, and pronounced coiled rim. It was the only grave good found in the burial of a man buried on his right side, head towards the north, in a line of burials following the west wall of a large enclosure in 'cemetery S', the centre of the northern cemeteries at Abydos. Several large enclosures, all dated to the First and Second Dynasties, have been traced along the desert parallel to the cultivation at Abydos. They seem to have marked the place of kingship rituals, particularly for the sed (festival of rejuvenation of the king). Around the earliest are lines of graves, each for a single person, with simple grave goods and in some instances tomb-stones marked with the name of the deceased."}
