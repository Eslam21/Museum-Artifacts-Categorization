It belongs to the type 76 in the typology of bronzes by K. Weiss, a type mainly attested in Saqqara, but also in Tanis and Bubastis, particularly in Late Period contexts (Weiss 2012, 164-166, 622-624, Taf. 20f-i). Several crude amuletic figures, made with the same flat solid-cast technique were discovered in Naukratis, such as BM 1885,1101.91, Oxford Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.616 and Boston Museum of Fine Arts 86.261 (Masson forthcoming).
