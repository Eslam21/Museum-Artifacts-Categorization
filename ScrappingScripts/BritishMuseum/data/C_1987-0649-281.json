The issues were not as large as those of Arsinoe, but were distinctive for their production on two different weight standards. Some gold and silver was produced, like these two examples, on the local Ptolemaic standard for use within the closed currency system of the kingdom. Others (see Walker & Higgs, cat. nos. 70-71) were produced on the Attic standard, evidently with a view to use abroad."], "Bibliographic references": ["Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth (80-81)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Berenice II"], "Acquisition name": [" Donated by: Art Fund (as NACF) ", " Bequeathed by: Mrs G E M Lewis "], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: R B Lewis"], "Acquisition date": ["1987"], "Department": ["Coins and Medals"], "Registration number": ["1987,0649.281"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 17 Aug 2000"]}
