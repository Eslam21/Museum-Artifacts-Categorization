The lower half of the face has been cut back and reworked (probably in the nineteenth - early twentieth century), the rest features are not modified. For sixty years the statue was regarded as that of Senwosert III, but detailed stylistic analysis recently made by Fay proves that it represents Amenemhat II. The statue was usurped by Ramesses II whose cartouches are carved on both upper arms."}
