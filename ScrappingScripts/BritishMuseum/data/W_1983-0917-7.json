Two further examples of this seal are in Jena (OMJ 311-F7; Stickel 1866, no. 6: Casanova 1894, no. 6) and in Istanbul, formerly in the Drouin collection (Edhem 1904, no. 5). It was suggested by Stickel (1866: 358) that this Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q, who can be generally termed an \u2018executive\u2019, could be identified with the governor of Mosul and the Diy\u0101r Rab\u012b\u02bba between 278/891 and 282/895. His father Is\u1e25\u0101q ibn Kund\u0101j (266\u201373/879\u201366) was also a governor of the Jaz\u012bra, who figured in struggles against the Tulunids of Egypt (Zambaur 1927: 37). Casanova disagreed with this proposition because he believed that the phrase \u02bbal\u0101 yaday was only ever used for subordinate officials and not for governors (Casanova 1894: 104\u20135). However, this theory has now been disproved. The phrase \u02bbal\u0101 yaday is found in a number of different contexts. It appears, for example, on Umayyad copper coins. Walker (1956: 227\u20138 and 263) cites two examples: one struck in Atr\u012bb Misr 132/749, with the caliph\u2019s name Marw\u0101n II on the obverse and the executive named as \u02bbAbd al-Malik b. Marw\u0101n on the reverse; and a fals struck in 130/747\u20138 with on the obverse the governor's name Yaz\u012bd b. \u02bbUmar, and below him the name of the executive whom Walker describes as \u2018Prefect of Rayy\u2019, \u1e24ab\u012bb b. Budayl. It also appears on later coins, for example, tenth-century Central Asian coins of Fergh\u0101na (Davidovitch 1972: 118, no. 25). In other contexts, the phrase \u02bbal\u0101 yaday is found for example in architectural inscriptions, where Blair (1998: 40, 51) suggests that it refers to the supervisor or master of works in charge of the accounts. The phrase also occurs on glass stamps (Morton 1985: 12\u201313) \u2013 the earliest occurrence is on stamps of the caliph Yazid II (720\u20134) with an official named Us\u0101ma b. Zayd (Morton 1985, nos. 26\u201328). Later stamps bear the names of officials, generally the finance director and a subordinate who, Morton argues in a later publication, were the mu\u1e25tasibs (market superintendents) who worked in the finance department (Morton 1991: 29). Where the phrase has been noted on lead seals, as in the present case, the executive\u2019s name appears with the caliph (Amitai-Preiss 1997: 23). Two further seals (Casanova 1894, nos. 4\u20135; Edhem 1904, nos. 3\u20134) are also in the name of the caliph al-Mu\u02bbta\u1e0did. One refers to the j\u0101liya of M\u0101h al-K\u016bfa, the other to the j\u0101liya of \u1e24ama\u1e0d\u0101n (for the term j\u0101liya see below, Cat. 27). The latter (Casanova 1894, no. 5) gives the name of a different executive of the Caliph al-Mu\u02bbta\u1e0did, who is named as Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-\u1e24usayn and is on the seals referred to as \u02bb\u0101mil to the caliph, the term usually denoting a government official, in some cases a director of finance or tax collector (Duri, \u2018\u0100mil\u2019, EI 2)."], "Bibliographic references": ["Porter 2011 / Arabic and Persian Seals and Amulets in the British Museum (23)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["From: Julius Richard"], "Acquisition date": ["1861"], "Acquisition notes": ["Acquired from Jules Richard in 1861."], "Department": ["Middle East"], "Registration number": ["1983,0917.7"]}
