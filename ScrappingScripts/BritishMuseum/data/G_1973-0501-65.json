{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.65"], "Description": [" Terracotta ithyphallic figure with jar. A naked youth, modelled in the round and seated on a rectangular plinth, with his bent left knee on the ground and his right knee raised. His head is shaven except for a side-lock on the left side of his head, curving down his back. To his right side he holds a large jar with a substantial rim, supporting it on the sole of his lifted left foot; his left hand is placed at his chest, holding a small pot. His phallus is hidden by the decorative surface coating. Solid; probably from a two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, stained or burnt on the front of the plinth and on the figure\u2019s face; much thick white dressing survives, painted pink. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?)
