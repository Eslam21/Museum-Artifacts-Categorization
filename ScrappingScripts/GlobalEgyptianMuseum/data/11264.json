In this statuette the contrast has been clearly marked, with the finely detailed head, neck, and tail of the animal being made of a dark greenish-grey bronze, whereas the body is made of wood. The body was carefully smoothed and fitted with gypsum inlays which were once completely gilded. Only scant remains of this gilding have been preserved at the onset of the tail feathers. The typical red eyes of the ibis have been indicated with jasper inlays. The legs have been beautifully carved in wood. They were covered with plaster and painted a dark colour in imitation of nature."}
