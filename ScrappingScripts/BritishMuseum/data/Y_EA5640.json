{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA5640"], "Description": [" Limestone ostracon with part of Kemit: four vertical lines of text in cursive hieroglyphs. The top edge is original, but the bottom edges are chipped. The text is written in black between red ruled lines, and the metrical verses of the text are marked by horizontal red lines. The style of script and the layout of the text are characteristic of the composition entitled Kemit ('The Compendium'). The signs on this ostracon are rather clumsily written.
