{"artifact_name": "seal", "Object Type": ["seal"], "Museum number": ["EA18485"], "Description": [" Pale green quartz (?) unfinished seal-stone (?), with the base cut straight and the top rounded. The cross-section would be rectangular if the vertical edges had not been bevelled off, causing them to taper towards the top. Both small sides were accidentally chipped near the top, as the maker clearly attempted to drill a horizontal suspension hole. Once broken, the object was left unfinished, which explains why the base has not been carved with a design or inscription.
