The mask covered the face, neck, and ears. It ended at the forehead where six small-perforated tongues allowed it to be fixed to the head of the mummy. The inlaid eyes are made of glass paste in different colors. The nose is perfect in form, and the lips are narrow and fleshy. The ears are not symmetrical as the left one protrudes further than the right."}
