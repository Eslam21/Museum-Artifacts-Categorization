{"artifact_name": "figure-mould", "Object Type": ["figure-mould"], "Museum number": ["EA46701"], "Description": [" The upper part of a plaster front-mould for a terracotta figure of a draped man, probably a dancer or other entertainer, broken off at the top of the thighs. He has a full head of curly hair and wears a twisted necklet or torc; he may be a black African or a Gaul. He wears a tunic, perhaps with short sleeves; it is rolled up to expose his genitals. His right arm (in the impression) is bent with the forearm stretched out sideways, and his left arm is fully bent, the forearm raised and the hand extended with the palm uppermost. Three registration hollows survive, one each side of the head and one above the head. White plaster; traces of an orange-red paint on the edges and in the registration hollows.
