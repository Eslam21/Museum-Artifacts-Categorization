", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903). This amulet was discovered in this context (amulet described in detail in Hogarth diary; on this context: Masson forthcoming). Pataikos might be related with the god Ptah as a craftman god (Andrews 1994, 39). He is definitely linked with the other dwarf god Bes, with whom he appears often on the same amulet or in the same context (on the relationship between these two gods: Bult\u00e9 1998, 379 and 382). As an amulet, Pataikos seems to appear as early as the 6th dynasty, although amulets of the dwarf god are better identified from the New Kingdom onwards (Andrews 1994, 39). His amulets are very common during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (as illustrated in Mendes: Wilson 1982, 32, pl. XXIX n\u00b03-4) and as popular as Bes in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming). The large amuletic figures of Pataikos standing on crocodiles, such as this one, are particularly popular during the Third Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 39), though their production persist in the Late Period. They are believed to protect against dangerous animals. Several figures of this type were discovered in Naukratis: BM 1886.0401.1496 and BM 1886.0401.1497; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 86.709; London, Petrie Museum UC54640. This one, however, presents some unusual features: his hands are not holding snakes, he wears a wig and a broad collar; decorated base.
