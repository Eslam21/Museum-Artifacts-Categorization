They could then have been good luck amulets, or, as demonstrated by the documents discovered at Mirgissa/Iken, the signatures of the subordinate civil servants, possibly even illiterates, supervising recording operations or the opening and closing of buildings. One of the most valued motifs, the round or flat spiral, is used here, framing two hieroglyphic signs.  "}
