There are also three unidentified shapes. The human figure is at lower left, with pecked outline and infill and arms outstretched sideways, and may be holding an unidentified object in the right hand. The Barbary sheep appears as if leaping from the human figure\u2019s left arm. The ostriches are infilled, with well-defined edges and pecked and rubbed infill. They stand on the centre left of the image, the smaller to the right of the larger. To the right of this is the figure of a quadruped with a long, tapered horn sweeping back (scimitar- horned oryx?) and to the lower right is another, more crudely carved with less deeply grooved edges and horns pointing straight up (cow?). To the upper right are four long, pecked, infilled legs of an unidentified animal cut off the edge of the image at the joint. Below the antelope figure on the right is an unidentified pecked infilled shape and at the top right there is another pecked, infilled unidentified shape (giraffe\u2019s head?). To the far lower right is the beginning of some cross-hatching cut off the edge of the image, to the right of the second unidentified quadruped. Wadi Hamra, Egypt.

Wadi Hamra is a canyon-like valley with a relatively flat floor between one and 200m wide, curling more or less south into the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert. There are three known rock art sites, all for engravings and first reported by Has Rhotert in 1952: The first is an old river terrace with numerous engravings of giraffe and a few of ostrich, cattle and abstract fan-shaped grooves, with stone circles and shallow depressions on the top. The second is several engravings further southwest. The third stands opposite the branch containing the first site: a rocky outcrop about 15 m high with a number of engravings along the base."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" engraved rock art ", " animal ", " cattle ", " bird ", " antelope (?)
