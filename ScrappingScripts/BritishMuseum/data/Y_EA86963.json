{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86963"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. On the rear on one side two coils of basketry, on the second side one coil of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front is flat and showed originally one impression of a scarab-like seal, but is now broken into two fragments along the seal, with a third fragment missing. The motif is not recognisable very well but might have shown a standing figure or Dd pillar.
