The engraved decoration on the ostrich egg is not easy to date: a good parallel is the myrtle wreath on the rim of a Caeretan hydria of the final third of the sixth century BC (Boardman 1998: 253, fig. 496); in general wreaths, including myrtle wreaths, are popular from at least the mid-sixth century BC onwards in Greek iconography (Kunze-G\u00f6tte 2006).
