{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.0552", "Dating": "3RD DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "VASE", "Material": "ANORTHOSITE", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; ENGRAVED", "Height": "5.1 cm", "Diameter": "18 cm", "Name": "Vase with inscription", "Description": "This vase of anorthosite comes from the tomb of Khaskhemwy, pharaoh of the 2nd Dynasty, at Abydos. On the outside, it carries an inscription mentioning a title (prince, high priest of Heliopolis, ritual priest, chief of the two gods in the nest) which is also seen on many vases from the beginning of the Old Kingdom. Seeing that these vases are not marked with the name of the owner, it is possible that they were given as votive offerings by Imhotep, architect of Djoser, bearing the same title on many other contemporary sources."}
