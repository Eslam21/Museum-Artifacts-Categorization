The book was issued with the date 1462 which was, as Hind noted, a misprint (the date MCCCCLXII should be read MCCCCLXXVII, with the omission of the Roman numeral XV). A finer edition of the atlas was published in Rome by the printer Arnoldus Buckinck the following year. The twenty-six maps occur in two states, the first with the sea plain and the second one with the sea shaded in curves in imitation of waves, and with the addition of ships and fishes. All maps in this volume are Hind's first state, except for nos. 6 and 17. The Bolognese edition of the 'Cosmographia' was executed and published by a partnership of printers and artists, among them Taddeo Crivelli, a Ferrarese miniaturist previously engaged in Ferrara on Duke Borso's 'Bible'."], "Bibliographic references": ["Hind 1938-48 / Early Italian Engraving, a critical catalogue (G.1.I)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" calligraphy ", " map/plan "], "Associated names": ["Illustration to: Claudius Ptolemaeus"], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: British Isles ", " Topographic representation of: Spain ", " Topographic representation of: Portugal ", " Topographic representation of: France ", " Topographic representation of: Netherlands ", " Topographic representation of: Germany ", " Topographic representation of: Austria ", " Topographic representation of: Hungary ", " Topographic representation of: Adriatic Sea ", " Topographic representation of: Italy ", " Topographic representation of: Sardinia ", " Topographic representation of: Sicily ", " Topographic representation of: Balkans ", " Topographic representation of: Greece ", " Topographic representation of: Crete ", " Topographic representation of: Morocco ", " Topographic representation of: Algeria ", " Topographic representation of: Tunis ", " Topographic representation of: Egypt ", " Topographic representation of: Ethiopia ", " Topographic representation of: Turkey ", " Topographic representation of: Russia ", " Topographic representation of: Caucasus ", " Topographic representation of: Palestine (Historic) ", " Topographic representation of: Syria ", " Topographic representation of: Iraq ", " Topographic representation of: Iran ", " Topographic representation of: Arabia ", " Topographic representation of: Siberia ", " Topographic representation of: Caspian Sea ", " Topographic representation of: China ", " Topographic representation of: Tibet ", " Topographic representation of: Afghanistan ", " Topographic representation of: Sistan (province) ", " Topographic representation of: India ", " Topographic representation of: Sri Lanka "], "Associated titles": ["Associated Title:", " Cosmographia "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: W & G Smith"], "Acquisition date": ["1845"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1845,0825.492-517"]}
