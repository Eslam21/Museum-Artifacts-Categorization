Across the wig is a decorated fillet band or diadem. The individual tresses of the hair have been braided at shoulder length and doubled on both sides, with shorter separated tighter braids around the ends of the hair. She wears a large beaded broad collar composed of various strands that sits high on the neck. She holds her left arm across the body, with a sistrum in her left hand.

Her dress, anklets, and feet all bear faint traces of paint. Harpocrates is shown as a naked infant resting on her lap with both of his hands placed by his sides.

Pakharkhonsu holding a figure of Osiris.   He wears a smooth shoulder-length ‘bag wig’, a simple headcloth style typical of the 26th Dynasty. His eyes are almond shaped with heavy ridges indicating the upper and lower eyelids, and he has thin arched eyebrows and a broad nose. The mouth is small with the outer corners slightly upturned to suggest a small smile, and the face is fleshy with a particularly rounded jawline. He wears a long garment of thick fabric tied high across the torso and reaching to his ankles. His left leg advances ahead of his right leg, and his hands are placed on either side of the god’s figure in front of him.

Harpocrates (Horus-the-Child), possibly a modern forgery.<br/><br/>Isis wears a sheath dress that reaches to the ankles, and a modius crown with a striated wig reaching to the chest. There is a suggestion of a uraeus cobra above the forehead. The upper body is crudely modelled with broad shoulders and arms uneven in size. The definition of the ears and hands are minimal, and there is little suggestion of the neck. Harpocrates is shown as a naked infant resting on her lap, both of his hands placed by his sides.

Harpokrates.  A grotesque cult-attendant carrying a statue of Harpokrates in a night-time procession. He walks to his right and faces front, holding the statue on his left shoulder; his extended right hand holds a torch. He wear a himation rolled below his belly and covering his upper legs, and a bound wreath on his head, with lotus buds tied on top, the ends of the ribbon falling on each shoulder. His phallus is very large, curving up as it touches the ground, and a frog perches on it. An uncertain object, perhaps a lantern, is placed behind the attendant’s right foot. The Harpokrates figure appears to be naked and in a seated position, its finger to its mouth; its head is shown shaved except for a side-lock. The back is largely plain, except for aspects of the wreath; there is a circular vent. The god-bearer’s face, the top of his head and the head of Harpokrates have split away and were repaired in antiquity with an application of plaster at the rear. A small hole has broken through behind.   Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt. Much colour remains: there is a white dressing over the front, and it is tinted a light-brown flesh colour on the skin of the theophoros and on Harpokrates; white is left reserved on the drapery. The wreath is painted pink, and its tie on the right shoulder is black and that on the left shoulder yellow. The glans of the phallus is painted red, as is the lantern (?) Harpokrates’ body is painted yellow over its flesh-colour. The end of the torch is tipped in yellow. The black of night is shown on the area of clay supporting the right arm and torch, and between the cult-attendant’s legs, where the frog is also painted black. The plain plinth has traces of black paint.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}},"value_combined":"_figure|figure","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"sculpture","summary_title_combined":"_sculpture|sculpture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x8949","checksum":4233206721,"id":"x8949","uuid":"5da4d4c3-ae96-3503-a873-24b20458514c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure","summary_title_combined":"_figure|figure","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}}]],"sort":"figure","type":"object name","value":"figure"}],"xtemplate":{"brief":"{\"Object Type\":{\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">figure</span>\",\"id\":\"x6729\"},\"Museum number\":\"1995,1211.1\",\"Cultures/periods\":{\"id\":\"x14428\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Ptolemaic</span>\"},\"Production date\":\"3rdC BC-2ndC BC\",\"Production place\":[{\"id\":\"x17904\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Made in:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Egypt</span>\"}]}"}},"sort":["figure",1.262649]},{"_index":"ciim","_type":"data","_id":"mip-o334286","_score":1.262649,"_source":{"identifier":[{"type":"prn","prn":"YCA17441","value":"YCA17441","primary":true},{"number":"45206","prefix":"EA","big_number":"EA45206","type":"big number","value":"EA45206"},{"codex_id":"160995","type":"codex id","value":"160995"},{"registration_number":"1907,0511.166","type":"registration number","value":"1907,0511.166"},{"type":"unique object id","value":"Y_EA45206","unique_object_id":"Y_EA45206"}],"multimedia":[{"processed":{"preview":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/preview_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":602}]}},"small":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/small_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":602}]}},"large":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/large_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":971},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1300}]}},"max":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/max_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1867},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":2500}]}},"mid":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/mid_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":747},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1000}]}},"huge":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/huge_BM_EA45206__2_.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1195},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1600}]}},"zoom":{"resizable":true,"format":"pyramid tiff","modified":1554291047153,"location":"Repository/Documents/2019_4/3_11/5cfedfd3_30fe_4df9_80c1_aa2400bde2bd/BM_EA45206__2_.ptif","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1936},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":2592}]}}},"sequence":0,"@link":{"type":"reference"},"view":"Full: Front","use":{"date":[{"date":1554246000000,"availability":true,"earliest":2019,"latest":2019}],"warning":false,"collection":true,"free":true},"legal":{"credit_line":"© The Trustees of the British Museum"},"admin":{"uid":"odin-1613643187","id":"1613643187","source":"odin","uuid":"a8cde6ba-4d54-3c7e-8df0-3417d37fd1ab"},"description":[{"value":"Arm from a wooden figure with a hole in the clenched hand for a staff; mortise and tenon at the shoulder; incised representation of Horus at the joint.<br/><br/>An exact match in size and quality to 45207.

He wears a large collar necklace and a kilt that reaches to the knees in back but is wrapped forward above the knees. Down the front of the kilt hangs a panel, apparently of beadwork, with a pendant cobra and a pair of ribbons at either side. The belt, worn high at the back, dips low in front to accommodate the king's girth. The head has been completely broken away. The back pillar, which would have extended halfway up the head, is largely intact, but its inscription has been almost completely erased. Only the beginning of a standard offering prayer can still be seen at the top and, faintly, the king's name at the bottom. What kind of crown Amenhotep III was wearing is something of a puzzle. The crown most frequently represented on his statuettes is a blue crown; but Amenhotep's version of the blue crown had streamers at the back. On the stone statuettes, they were represented in relief on the negative space behind each shoulder, but they are not indicated here. The other headdress frequently represented on small figures of Amenhotep III is a double crown, set on top of a short, round wig.

Standing nude youth; preserved from the neck to the knees; right elbow and hand are damaged. He is standing in a frontal position with the left leg slightly advanced with the weight evenly distributed. The shoulders are very broad, rounded and sloping; the torso is tubular though expanding around the chest. The pectorals are rendered separately with a fine incised line to indicate them. The right arm is angled, the closed right hand is placed on the chest below the pectorals; the thumb is stretched out, the hand is not holding any object. The left arm is hanging down the left side, below the pectoral it is separated from the torso for a short bit. The left hand is clenched and it has been suggested that it is holding a 'shadow rod' (Schattenstab); the thumb is stretched downwards.

The figure stands to the front, the weight on both legs, the left slightly advanced. The youth is wearing a chiton and a himation; the sleeves of the chiton are indicated by horizontal grooves on the upper arms (not to be misread as armlets), its edge is visible around the neck. The himation is slung around the left shoulder, the edges are indicated by diagonal incised lines across the chest and and back. Other than that the body appears to be in the nude; the horizontal line of the himation's lower edge is not indicated though the oblique incision above the pubes might be its upper edge. The chest is protruding and separated by a line in the centre. Three angular tresses are falling down in the front over chest and upper arms on either side.

of a male official, his head now lost.<br/><br/>The figure is broken from the neck area, with uneven damage to the shoulders and back. His chest is bare, and the musculature of his upper body is faintly modelled. He wears a long kilt that envelops his legs and feet, with a thick belt around his waist.

A faint ridge above indicates his eyebrows, and there is a notable crease at the brow above the nose. His nose is broad with visible folds of flesh on either side at the nostrils, and a clear cupid’s bow above his upper lip. His mouth is small with thick lips, with the lower lip sharply incised. The face is fleshy and rounded at the mouth, jawline, and neck. His collarbone, chest muscles and abdomen are clearly modelled, and there is a narrowing at his waist.

 An adolescent girl standing, modelled in the round and carrying on her head a covered vessel, probably a basket. She wears a long chiton with short sleeves, girdled very high on the chest and with a long overfall reaching to just above her knees; her feet peep out from the bottom edge of the chiton. A narrow himation (or a wide one folded lengthways) is wrapped round the middle of her body, one end gripped by her muffled left hand, the other passing over her bent left forearm. Her right arm is raised to support a shallow bowl-like basket with a low domed top and central boss; a radial groove extends from the boss to the rim. The lid of the basket is half covered by a cloth that hangs down behind her to just below her shoulders. The rear of the figure has detailed modelling of her clothing, and she stands on a plain rectangular plinth, open below. There is no vent.  Hollow; two-piece mould. From the same workshop as Terracotta  3198, from Naukratis. Light orange-brown clay with some mica, probably a marl ware: it is unlike the reddish shelly clays of the Cyrenaica, from whence it is said to come, and is probably of Alexandrian manufacture. Most of the thick overall white dressing survives, and scientific analysis shows it to be kaolinite (BM Department of Scientific Research Report 7048, 10 May 1999). Over the white, the figure is decorated in various postfiring colours, but little of the paint extends to the rear. Her short curly hair is painted dark red, and two narrow vertical stripes of rose madder run from her shoulders to the hem of her chiton, the edge of which is encircled by a similar narrow stripe; a stripe of rose madder is also painted along the centre of her himation. The cloth covering the basket borne on her head is painted blue on its front, its edge and the narrow fold passing over the centre; it is left white behind. A narrow strip of blue surrounds, except for the rear, the drapery and feet on top of the plinth. The underside of the basket is painted yellow, to indicate gold.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}},"value_combined":"_figure|figure","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"sculpture","summary_title_combined":"_sculpture|sculpture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x8949","checksum":4233206721,"id":"x8949","uuid":"5da4d4c3-ae96-3503-a873-24b20458514c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure","summary_title_combined":"_figure|figure","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}}]],"sort":"figure","type":"object name","value":"figure"}],"xtemplate":{"brief":"{\"Object Type\":{\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">figure</span>\",\"id\":\"x6729\"},\"Museum number\":\"1862,1021.3\",\"Cultures/periods\":{\"id\":\"x14428\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Ptolemaic</span>\"},\"Production date\":\"3rdC BC(mid)-3rdC BC(late)\",\"Production place\":[{\"id\":\"x21094\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Made in:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Alexandria (Egypt)</span>\"}],\"Findspot\":[{\"id\":\"x31142\",\"value\":\"<span class=\\\"vprefix\\\">Excavated/Findspot:</span> <span class=\\\"vterm\\\">Cyrenaica (modern)</span>\"}]}"}},"sort":["figure",1.1377323]},{"_index":"ciim","_type":"data","_id":"mip-o2404090","_score":1.1357752,"_source":{"identifier":[{"type":"prn","prn":"XNK3160","value":"XNK3160","primary":true},{"Miscellaneous_number":"AN1896-1908-G.82","note":[{"type":"comment","value":"Accession Number"}],"type":"Miscellaneous number","value":"AN1896-1908-G.82"},{"codex_id":"3444831","type":"codex id","value":"3444831"},{"type":"registration number"},{"type":"unique object id","value":"X__1613","unique_object_id":"X__1613"}],"multimedia":[{"processed":{"preview":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1356102417715,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/7_12/9a7a3a7e_6057_41d0_a1a7_a3dc00d34a2f/preview_01291924_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":450}]}},"small":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1356102417715,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/7_12/9a7a3a7e_6057_41d0_a1a7_a3dc00d34a2f/small_01291924_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":450},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":450}]}},"mid":{"resizable":true,"format":"jpeg","modified":1356102417715,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/7_12/9a7a3a7e_6057_41d0_a1a7_a3dc00d34a2f/mid_01291924_001.jpg","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":1000},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":1000}]}},"zoom":{"resizable":true,"format":"pyramid tiff","modified":1356102417715,"location":"Repository/Documents/2014_11/7_12/9a7a3a7e_6057_41d0_a1a7_a3dc00d34a2f/01291924_001.ptif","location_is_relative":true,"type":"image","measurements":{"dimensions":[{"units":"pixels","dimension":"height","value":2880},{"units":"pixels","dimension":"width","value":2880}]}}},"sequence":0,"@link":{"type":"reference"},"view":"Full: Front","use":{"date":[{"date":1433977200000,"availability":true,"earliest":2015,"latest":2015}],"warning":false,"collection":true,"free":false},"legal":{"credit_line":"© Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford.

Herakles naked, modelled in the round and standing on a rectangular plinth with mouldings on its bottom edge. He is bearded and wears a wreath of leaves. Wrapped round his bent left arm is a garment that seems to be a lion’s skin, but is obscurely modelled; the hand is lost, but may have held apples. The lowered right hand rests on the handle of his club, which is placed vertically by his right leg, its head resting on the ground. The head of Herakles has a diagonal break rising from below the right ear: this was repaired in antiquity by an application of white plaster both in front of the wreath and over the whole of the top of the head; the plaster was reinforced with palm-fibre and possibly human hair.  The figure was wrapped in textile when it was deposited, presumably in a tomb: marks of the cloth survive on the front, notably on the chest and the left thigh, but much actual fabric remains on the rear of the figure and on the back and the sides of the plinth, occasionally in several layers.   Hollow; two-piece mould; the plinth was made separately and the figure fixed to it with blobs of grey-brown plaster: the left foot was raised slightly higher than was the right when this was done. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a darkbrown core. There are considerable remains of a white dressing, particularly on the front, but also on the back. Much paint remains: pink on the body, limbs and face; the lion’s skin is painted buff and the club also appears to have the same colour, with black bands near its head; black paint delineates the pubic hair and may have been used on the features of the face; black paint also covers the plinth above its mouldings, which were left white, and was also used on the plaster that held the figure to the plinth.","primary":true}],"source":{"legal":{"rights":[{"severity":"11","type":"copyright"}]}},"type":{"type":"image","base":"media"}}],"name":[{"reference":{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}},"value_combined":"_figure|figure","hierarchy":[[{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"sculpture","summary_title_combined":"_sculpture|sculpture","admin":{"uid":"mip-x8949","checksum":4233206721,"id":"x8949","uuid":"5da4d4c3-ae96-3503-a873-24b20458514c"}},{"@link":{"type":"reference"},"summary_title":"figure","summary_title_combined":"_figure|figure","admin":{"uid":"mip-x6729","id":"x6729","uuid":"99eae8d8-5c2a-3df6-92a8-7618da395b9c"}}]],"sort":"figure","type":"object

The youth is wearing a chiton and a himation; the sleeves of the chiton are indicated by horizontal grooves on the upper arms (not to be misread as armlets), its edge is visible around the neck. The himation is slung around the left shoulder, the edges are indicated by diagonal incised lines across the chest and and back.

The material has a fringed edge which extends from the neck down to the lower left side of the body. His right arm is exposed from the garment, and his hand rests on his upper thigh. He wears a thick bracelet on his right wrist. His legs and feet are enveloped by his long garment, and his name is carved across the clothing at his knees.
