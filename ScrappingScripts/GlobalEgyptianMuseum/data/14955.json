{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 53327", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "SISTRUM", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "24 cm", "Name": "Sistrum with The Dwarf God Bes", "Description": "A large and richly decorated sistrum. The traditional and principal decoration is the double head of the goddess Hathor surmounted by an arch, the top of which is decorated with a recumbent cat and three kittens; the base is decorated with an open naos. The naos, most probably, would have served to hold an animal representation that is now missing. Between the two arms of the arch there was a number of rods, square in section, of which only two are left. On each side of the head of Hathor is a uraeus; one wears the crown of Upper Egypt and the other the crown of Lower Egypt. These start on the shoulders of the goddess and extend to the outer sides of the naos. Under the collar of Hathor, the handle of the sistrum is decorated with a figure of the dwarf Bes, god of joy, wearing the feathers on his head and standing on a papyrus-shaped crown and two sphinxes."}
