{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 4431", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GIZA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "CASTING", "Height": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Statue of Cobra Rearing to Strike", "Description": "The statue depicts a cobra rearing and ready to strike. It rests on a small column on top of an unmarked rectangular base. The cobra symbolized divine and royal protection and was primarily identified with Buto, the goddess of the crown of Lower Egypt. Buto's connection with the sun god Re caused her to be connected to many goddesses and, thus, the symbol of the cobra became a hieroglyph for female divinity."}
