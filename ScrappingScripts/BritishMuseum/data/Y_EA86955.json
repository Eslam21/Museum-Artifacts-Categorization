{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86955"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine Nile clay that was burnt and now is completely black in colour. The object was hardened after excavation and shows a shiny surface. On the rear on one side three coils of basketry, on a second side another row of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front is flat and shows one complete impression of an oval scarab-like seal with many finger impressions around it. The seal itself is relatively roughly cut and shows a winged scarab underneath a sun disc.
