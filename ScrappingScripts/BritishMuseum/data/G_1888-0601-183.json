Although Lemos does not discuss this sherd, it ought to belong to her Group of Elaborate Animal Chalices. Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1). This newly discovered join with 1888,0601.466.f calls into question the published inscription in Hutton, C. A. 'Inscriptions on pottery from Naukratis', Classical Review 7, 1893, 83, IV because the iconography from this join makes clear that 1888,0601.182 goes to the left of 1924,1201.15."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (pl. 32.3) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1581) (phase 2) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["mammal"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.182"]}
