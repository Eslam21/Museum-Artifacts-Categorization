{"artifact_name": "vessel", "Object Type": ["vessel"], "Museum number": ["EA22347"], "Description": [" An open vessel of coarse red siltware pottery, with a rounded base and near vertical sides, which rise to a rounded rim. There is a moulding around the exterior below the rim and also a shallow groove some 3cm lower. The base is perforated by a small hole, apparently part of the original design, since it is surrounded by a low rim. The vessel exhibits irregularities: the level of the rim varies and the profiles of the sides are not regular. The exterior bears substantial remains of a slip, which varies in colour from pink to pale cream.
