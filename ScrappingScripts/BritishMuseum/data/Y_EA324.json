{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA324"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Ptahmay: an elaborate door-shaped stela, topped by torus molding and a cavetto cornice, and containing two scenes. In the upper register, seated on lion-footed chairs, are the stela's owner, a Guardian of the Treasury called Ptahmay, and his wife Takhert. Before them their son Paatenemheb and daughter Meryt offer prayers. In the lower register a man called Huy and his wife Wabt are seated on stools beside two young children, a boy labeled \"his son Hat\" and a girl \"his daughter Wadjyt.\" Two further adults seated at right are named \"his son Ramessu\" and \"his daughter Iwy.\" The relationship between the figures in the lower register and Ptahmay is not clear. Carved around the edges of the stela are two mirror-image offering formulae. One asks the Aten for the usual bread and beer, flesh and fowl on Ptahmay's behalf; the other is an appeal to Ra, with various epithets, to grant a vision of his beauty to the deceased.
