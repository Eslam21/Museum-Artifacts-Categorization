Some sandals were made of gold. The sandals were tied with two thongs and their tips pointed upward. This pair of sandals is made of leather and has depictions of enemies on the soles. Four human figures portraying Asian and African neighbors, who were the traditional enemies of Egypt, are shown. The men are depicted as prisoners, lying prostrate with their arms bound behind their backs. The Pharaoh would symbolically trample on them when he wore his sandals. The sandals are also adorned on the top and bottom by the nine bows, symbols of the traditional enemies of Egypt."}
