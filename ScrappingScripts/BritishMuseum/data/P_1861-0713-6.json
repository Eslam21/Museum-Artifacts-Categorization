The BM has a single impression of the rare first version from the Scarisbrick collection, 1861,0713.259, taken from the plate ruined by foulbiting and another two from the same source of the later print, 1861,0713.261-262. According to Pier-Jean Mariette's notes (P. de Chennevi\u00e8res and A. de Montaiglon (eds), 'Abecedario de P. J. Mariette et autres notes in\u00e9dites de cet amateur sur les arts et les artistes', Paris, 1853, I, pp. 286-287) the cabinet maker Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle had two studies by Callot for the print, one of which may conceivably be the present one as it has a French XVIIIc provenance. Mariette in the Crozat sale (1741) mentioned along with the drawing in that collection a fourth one that is possibly the drawing now in Dresden (inv. 600), D. Ternois, 'Jacques Callot. Catalogue De Son Oeuvre dessin\u00e9. Suppl\u00e9ment (1962-1998)', Paris, 1999, no. 1506. In the Quentin de Lorang\u00e8re sale (see the description given in the provenance) a drawing from the Jullienne sale is mentioned of the subject, but said wrongly to be related to Callot's first version. The Crozat drawing is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm (2471/1863; Ternois no. 953) and the Julienne one is in the Hermitage, St Petersburg (14522; Ternois 954). The much damaged BM drawing is closest to the print and is therefore most likely the last of the trio to have been executed. Ternois also listed a fourth drawing of the subject in the Ashmolean Museum as being related to the print (K.T. Parker, 'Catalogue of the collection of drawings in the Ashmolean Museum: Netherlandish, German, French and Spanish schools', Oxford, 1938, no. 394; Ternois 956). The Oxford drawing is completely unlike the other three drawings and Ternois in the 1992 Callot catalogue revised his opinion, believing it to be more likely a study for a theatrical backdrop.
