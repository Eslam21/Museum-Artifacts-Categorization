", " The exterior and interior surfaces of the sherd were burnt during the bombings in London in 1941. Although Schlotzhauer (Schlotzhauer 2012) does not discuss this sherd, the rim and body find parallels with his South Ionian cups with everted rim Type 5C. These cups are both amongst the earliest South Ionian cups at Naukratis and are relatively rare at the site. These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18), Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116), and Vallet and Villiard's Ionian Cup Type A2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88).
