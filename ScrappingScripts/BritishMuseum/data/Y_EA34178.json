Six boxes of similar blue faience shabtis were found along with the mummy of Pinudjem in the Deir el-Bahri cache. Pinudjem I was a high priest of Amun at Thebes and army controller, who ruled southern Egypt while the north under the control of rulers at Tanis. He married a daughter of Ramses XI to cement his power and part way through his rule he adopted royal iconography and then later royal titulary. On this shabti, royal iconography was also adopted in the form of the uraeus and false beard, though some of Pinudjem\u2019s other shabtis lack these. Some of the shabtis take the form of workers, others of reis. His son Pseusennes I went on to become king at Tanis.
