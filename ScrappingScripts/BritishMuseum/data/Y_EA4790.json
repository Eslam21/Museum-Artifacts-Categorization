In a burial context, the fertility imagery suggests rebirth and a desire for regeneration in the Beyond. The predominant, though not exclusive, association of the bowls with women's graves is noteworthy: three bowls, for example, were found at the head end of a Theban female coffin. Female associations are further emphasized by inscribed votive examples from Deir el-Bahri that mention, besides Hathor, queens or princesses but not kings. Bibliography: M.
