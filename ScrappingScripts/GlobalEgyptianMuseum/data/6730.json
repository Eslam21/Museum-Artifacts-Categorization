The clay is relatively fine, was fully oxidised at the end of the firing process and was covered with a thin brick-red slip. The polish is rather crude but the burnishing partly hides the imperfections. There is an incised motif on the shoulder of the vase: a band of triangles filled with lines, opposing one another at the tip. This jar was broken in half during antiquity. Holes were then made along the edges of the sherds and the two sections were put back together with strings, usually leather straps. This type of vessel is typical of the Middle Kerma and usually contained food. Many such examples, of different sizes, were placed in each burial."}
