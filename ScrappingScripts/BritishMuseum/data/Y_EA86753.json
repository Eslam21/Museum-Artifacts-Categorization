{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86753"], "Description": [" Fragment of a seal-impression, the fine brown Nile clay has some mica inclusions and was hardened after excavation. The rear shows one side with three small coils of basketry and a second side with two further coils of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the wall and a lid of a basket. The front shows a largely complete preserved oval scarab-like seal-impression, slightly distorted and destroyed. Visible is a circumferential line, inside a kneeling male figure on the left, facing to the right with a lion to the right of it, having its front paws at the shoulders of the figure (probably a defeated enemy). Underneath the figure and behind the lion further signs that are no longer recognisable. This seems to be the same motif as EA86761.
