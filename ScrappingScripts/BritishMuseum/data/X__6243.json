", " A member of the 'Block Group' Webb 1978, 89-92, Fig. 24,a., pl. XIII. See especially vi) Seated or kneeling figure with drum, vii) Kneeling and walking figures holding attributes difficult to identify. See in particular nos 413, and 414, pl. XIII, p. 90. These are both from Lindos, Blinkenberg, Lindos i, 1931, no. 1256, and no. 1260, pl.55 and are crudely but distinctively modelled figures presenting objects or playing musical instruments. The head would have corresponded to that on no 414, and the original glaze would have included a black-brown glaze stripe on bottom of hem. Other examples of these two groups come from Archaic levels at Perachora, and Aigina, as well as a plentiful number from Lindos, and several, unpublished as yet, from Samos Heraion. (N.B. Perachora 'PC Deposit' is not a trustworthy deposit for dating. These pieces are of early sixth century date, and never appear in dated Protocorinthian contexts elsewhere.)
