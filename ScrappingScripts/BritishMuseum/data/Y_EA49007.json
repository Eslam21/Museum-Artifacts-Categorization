Spencer, Early Egypt, London (1993), fig. 31 (misdated) The harpoon was originally wrapped in cloth, a trace of which still adheres to the barb. The point is sharpened on both sides. The harpoon head was embedded in a shaft and at the junction was the end of a thick cord tied around the copper, remnants of which still survive. The cord may have bound the head to the shaft or more likely, the head was not firmly fixed to the shaft and would detach when the barb struck the prey (fish or hippo) but could be found by use of the cord and a float."], "Location": ["On display (G64/dc3)"], "Condition": ["good"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1909"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA49007"], "Registration number": ["1909,0804.6"]}
