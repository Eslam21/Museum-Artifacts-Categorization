{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA205"], "Description": [" Funerary stela of Hapu: limestone stela with a cavetto cornice. A crudely incised scene shows the deceased seated before an offering table with a figure on the other side offering bread. The hieroglyphic text contains the offering formula and gives his name as 'Hepu, begotten of. . .', but the name of his parent is illegible due to the clumsy carving. Below is a Middle Egyptian offering formula for his relatives. There are traces of pigment (blue and black) in the incised signs, and on the figure (red).
