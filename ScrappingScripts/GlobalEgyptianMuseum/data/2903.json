{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:246", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "BEAD", "Material": "AMETHYST", "Technique": "CARVED; POLISHED", "Width": "1 cm", "Name": "Bead", "Description": "Small barrel-bead of amethyst, perforated lengthways for suspension. The stone was favoured in particular by Middle Kingdom jewellers, in the early second millennium BC. In the absence of archaeological context, its interest lies in the date of acquisition, as part of the collection of antiquities formed by Lady Harriet Kavanagh. Her collection with its inventory provides a rare example of a well-documented private group of materials from the 1840s. Each item would correspond to a desirable, affordable and transportable example of a category of antiquity, in this case ancient jewellery."}
