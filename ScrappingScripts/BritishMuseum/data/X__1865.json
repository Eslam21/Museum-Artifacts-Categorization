The sleeveless himation passes under the right and over the left breast, having slipped down the right shoulder. Mould-made and hollow with added solid arms and head. The back smoothed. Covered with white coating with traces of red paint on head-dress and hair. Fine pale yellow-buff fabric, somewhat soapy to the touch. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Classical Greek (?)
