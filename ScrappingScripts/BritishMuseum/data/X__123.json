", " Lemos places this sherd in Stage 2 of Group D of the Sphinx and Lion Style. Although the imagery is lively, the execution of the figures is loose and careless.

Furthermore, the deterioration of the Sphinx and Lion Style appears quite clearly in the execution of the face of the different figures.
