She is portrayed with a full face and aquiline nose. Her abundant hair is braided and tied at the back of her skull but spills out in a wreath of tight curls that frames her face. This head was discovered in 1900 at the bottom of the central shaft of the Rotunda in the Catacombs of Kom Al-Shuqafa, together with four other portrait statues. One of the other four portraits was identified as a priest of Serapis.The Emperor Domitian was assassinated because his authoritarian rule was so hated. Because of this, it is highly unlikely that the head of his wife would have been publicly exhibited after his death, but just how it came to be lying at the bottom of the Rotunda is not known."}
