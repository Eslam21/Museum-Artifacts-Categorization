", " In the British Museum a similar, but taller, Egyptian lamp (Bailey 1975, no. Q514) and a similar Rhodian lamp form (Bailey 1975, no. Q374, also found at Naukratis) have been dated to the 6th and 5th centuries BC. The fabric resembles Nile silt fabrics from the Nile Delta and suggests manufacture at Naukratis. An Egyptian production place is confirmed by its falling into Mommsen's NAA Egypt group 'Qann' (Schlotzhauer & Villing 2006, 65 fig. 44; Schlotzhauer in Schlotzhauer and Weber forthcoming, Nau 159). We do not know, however, whether this was made, in a Greek style, for a Greek or Egyptian patron.
