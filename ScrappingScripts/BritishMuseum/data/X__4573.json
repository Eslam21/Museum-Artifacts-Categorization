This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Amulets in the shape of red and white crowns are characteristic of the 26th Dynasty, even though red crown's amulets are already in used in the First Intermediate Period (Andrews 1994, 74; see various examples in: Petrie 1914, pl. IV no. 49). Germond dates a similar amulet to the 26th Dynasty or a little later (Germond 2005, no. 75). Our specimen, rather crudely shaped, could be probably dated after the 26th Dynasty. An even cruder specimen was given a wider chronologic frame, from 450 BC till 30 BC (Herrmann et al. 2010, 149, no. 4). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty. However, the registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
