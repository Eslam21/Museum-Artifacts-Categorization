The garlic heads are composed of individually modelled cloves placed around a cylindrical central core. The number of cloves on the complete garlic heads ranges from 8 to 10, thus the number of loose cloves suggests there were at least 9 garlic heads in total within this tomb.

Similar models from Abydos are discussed by U. Hartung, Nile Mud and Clay Objects from the Predynastic Cemetery U At Abydos (Umm El-Qa\u2019ab) in the same volume. These parallels show that despite the humble material, model food was generally placed only in the richest tombs."], "Location": ["On display (G64/dc3)"], "Condition": ["poor"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1909"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA49013"], "Registration number": ["1909,0804.12"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 29 Apr 2014"]}
