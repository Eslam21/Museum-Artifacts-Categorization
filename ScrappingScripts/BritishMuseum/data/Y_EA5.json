{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA5"], "Description": [" Granodiorite statue of Amenhotep III: the statue, mounted on a pedestal, represents a figure seated on a throne, wearing the 'nemes' head-dress with uraeus, and a beard, bead-collar, short skirt and tail. On the sides of the throne is incised a hieroglyphic symbol flanked by lily and papyrus flowers intertwined, symbolising the union of the Two Lands. The inscriptions are incised on the girdle of the skirt and on the front and back of the throne. The inscriptions are well preserved, with the exception of the one on the right-hand side of the front of the throne, which is somewhat mutilated. The cartouches containing the name of Amenhotep III and the other places in which this name appears have been erased and recut in antiquity. The statue has been restored.
