The secondary figures, such as the servants who bring the food, have been depicted on an even smaller scale. Among the latter is also a group of dancing girls. Seven dancers of normal stature and one dwarf are shown moving to the rhythm of music being made by three other women, not in the photo. Some of the dancers shake sistrums.
