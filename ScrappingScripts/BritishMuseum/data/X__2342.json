This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Hunting or battle scenes such as the one depicted on this scarab are common on scarabs and scaraboids dated to the end of the Ramesside Period-early Third Intermediate Period (see especially the comments and references in Keel 1997, 561-562; Magnarini 2004, 10.09; similar scene decorating the underside of a scarab and of a scaraboid in the shape of a Black African head: Hornung and Staehelin 1976, 367, no. 906, 908). Naukratis provided a similar motif on a scaraboid: BM 1888,0601.70 (published in Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 73, 67). The collection in Bristol holds a series of early scarabs from Naukratis, often said to come from the Scarab Factory like here, and which were not illustrated in earlier publications. Petrie illustrated several other early examples of scarabs and scaraboids. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming).
