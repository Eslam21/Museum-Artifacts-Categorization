Jacques Thuiller, in cat. exhib. 'S\u00e9bastien Bourdon' (Paris, 2000), No.179, was somewhat reluctant to include this plate in the series: the technique, he notes, is different; the use of cross-hatching is limited and the sky and the background are barely bitten. However, the similar dimensions and inscriptions and the fact that Mariette includes the plate in his description of the set, suggest that the plate was indeed part of the set, but that it may have been included at a slightly later date."], "Bibliographic references": ["Robert-Dumesnil 1835-71 / Le Peintre-Graveur Fran\u00e7ais (I.145.24.II)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["flight into egypt"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Holy Family"], "Acquisition name": [" Purchased from: Lady Juliana St Aubyn ", " Purchased through: Winstanley's (sale 6-12.viii.1856/176) ", " Purchased through: Holloway (& Son) "], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Sir John St Aubyn"], "Acquisition date": ["1856"], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["1856,0815.29"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 01 Dec 2005"]}
