{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA271"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Parennefer: there are two sections on this stela whose top is not extant. A solar barque resting on a sky sign is depicted in raised relief in the upper register. Below seven columns of text are incised, consisting of a prayer to Re\u2018 on behalf of the necropolis-workman Parennefer who is shown in sunk relief on the right in an attitude of adoration. The upper part of the stela is broken off. The surviving portion is well preserved apart from a few gouges and scratches on the surface. There are traces of yellow paint on the disk, solar bark, hieroglyphs, kilt of the figure and on the dividing lines between the columns of text.

G. H. James, 'Hieroglyphic texts from Egyptian stelae, etc., in the British Museum' Part 9 (London, 1970), 52-3, pl. 42) which names his wife Mutemwia, two sons Sety and Bakenmut, and a daughter Werner. It is probable that the name of Sety should be restored as the first son on this stela, but, as the stela is badly gouged, it is not certain that this name was deliberately mutilated since its loss may have been coincidental. Apart from these three stelae, Parennefer and his family are otherwise unattested. Bibliography: The British Museum, 'A guide to the Egyptian galleries (Sculpture)' (London, 1909), 138 (no. 489); B.
