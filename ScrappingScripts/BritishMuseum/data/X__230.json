This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Higgins suggests that a close parallel from Naukratis in the British Museum of these Egyptian style figures (GR 1886,0401.1453) was made in Naukratis and dated to the early 6th century BC (Higgins 1954, 405). Nile silt fabric is too generic to specifically attribute to Naukratis, and does not resemble figure wasters found near the terracottas workshop. A groove on the underside suggests this was fixed onto ridge of body, such as another Naukratis figure in the British Museum (GR 1886,0401.1422), also dated to the early 6th century BC (ibid.).
