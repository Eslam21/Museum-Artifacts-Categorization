The inscriptions on her coffin state that she died at the age of 17 years, 1 month and 25 days (an earlier reading of the age as 11 years is now discarded, as the developmental state of the skeleton indicates death in late teens). The body is wrapped in fine linen bandages with an outer shroud, secured by bandages crossing diagonally and horizontally, decorated with a polychrome painted full-length representation of Nut, flanked by other deities, including Isis, Nephthys and Anubis, with a wooden comb, a string of berries and the remains of a funerary wreath lying on top of the mummy. Body and Limbs - Very little can be observed in this mummy owing to dense material, probably plaster, under the bandages. The ribs and bones of the arms and legs can be seen to have no fractures. There is an indeterminate opacity in the body-cavity. The arms are extended, the palms of the hands in contact with the outer aspect of the thighs. the left hip is dislocated, probably the result of tight bandaging. No lines of arrested growth.
