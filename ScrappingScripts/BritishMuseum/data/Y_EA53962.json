{"artifact_name": "stopper; plug; seal-impression", "Object Type": [" stopper ", " plug ", " seal-impression "], "Museum number": ["EA53962"], "Description": [" Yellow plaster wine-amphora stopper with Nile silt pottery disc plug (mostly lost). The seal is made from lime plaster or lime plaster and gypsum mix. It has been impressed with a circular stamp and then painted red (only traces remain). A cross occupies the centre of the circle; in the upper quadrants are the letters \u03b1 and \u03c0, perhaps initials of a name, and, in the lower quadrants \u03b1 and \u03c9, the nomen sacrum. There are inconclusive traces of two string marks, possibly used for removal. The black sealant is barely visible, but is probably pine pitch.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1& 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1 & 7). The black sealant on this object is barely visible, but is probably pine pitch, indicating that this stopper belonged to a wine amphora (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). The cross motif and amphora fabric used for the plug suggests a late Roman date of 4th century to early 7th century AD. Cf., very similar late Roman stamps were found on plaster amphora stoppers from Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 27.2\u20134), but none with the same letters. Bruy\u00e8re, B. 1966.
