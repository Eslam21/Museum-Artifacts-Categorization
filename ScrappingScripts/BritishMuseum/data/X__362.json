This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Scaraboids in the shape of a ram's head pertain to a common series produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d, which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (on the various productions of the Scarab Factory, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. The underside decoration appears to be a winged creature, popular on scarabs produced at Naukratis. Petrie interpreted the original (already much worn down- as indicated by his cross-hatching: Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 54) as representing a winged uraeus, with sun-disc above its head, a motif popular in Egyptian iconography. The style of the decoration recalls other scarabs and scaraboids decorated with mythical hybrid creatures, winged griffins and lions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 144-147) but also a winged scarab (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, no. 138). Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis. Part II (Sixth Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund), London.
