", " The association of a squatting deity and a falcon is a known theme on scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 127; on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This scaraboid belongs to a type that was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93, 98, 101, 106-107, type XXVIII A, subtype 214-219b, see especially A216 for this piece). On the distribution list, the sketch accompanying this piece shows a squatting deity holding a ankh sign. It seems though that the deity holds a wadj sceptre.
