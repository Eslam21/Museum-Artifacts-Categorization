{"artifact_name": "bust; trial-piece", "Object Type": [" bust ", " trial-piece "], "Museum number": ["EA57273"], "Description": [" Schist bust of a royal figure, a sculptor\u2019s model or trial piece. The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth with the material tucked behind the ears and with the long lappets on either side reaching down to the chest. The king also wears a uraeus ornament with the coiled body of the cobra figure across the top of the nemes, its raised hood and head placed above the king\u2019s forehead. There is no indication of clothing across the king\u2019s body. The small almond shaped eyes include a thin incised line to indicate the upper and lower eyelids, and the thin eyebrows are indicated by deep ridges which are wide set across the forehead. The king has a long broad nose, with a fleshy face emphasised by the folds of skin around the mouth area and the rounded cheeks. The thin lips are curved into a small smile, with a clear cupid\u2019s bow above the upper lip. On the reverse the bust includes an incised proportional grid, with the division of squares used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure production of a uniform three-dimensional sculpture. There are several small chips notable around the edges of the bust on the obverse.

Such models were used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure production of an even three-dimensional sculpture, emphasised by the surviving proportional grid on the reverse of this model. As with most busts, this example also ends at the tips of the nemes lappets that reach onto the king\u2019s upper body. Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain. The provenance for this particular example is not known (PM VIII). Further Bibliography: W. Siepel, 1992. Gott, Mensch, Pharao (Vienna), p. 494-495, Fig. 207. General Sources: S-A.
