This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The child deity was very popular in Naukratis. He appears in a large number of small votives and amuletic figures, in a variety of materials and shapes (Masson forthcoming). His cult was particularly developed in the Delta during the Late and Ptolemaic periods (Sandri 2006). On Harpokrates (or child god) amulets see: Andrews 1994, 16, fig. 10; Herrmann et al. 2010, 28-29 (type 2). Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty, though this pendant is definitely later in date, probably ptolemaic. The registers of the Museum of Fine Arts tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs, scaraboids and their moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Let's note that the records written (or at least supervised) by Amelia Edwards mention the Scarab Factory as the findspot too.
