{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA32204"], "Description": [" Deep crescentic axe-head: with an unusual strengthening feature in the form of a raised rib running down the middle of the blade. It is attached by means of metal rivets to a cylindrical copper casing, which originally enclosed a wooden haft, decayed remains of which survive inside. The rivets, three in number, were inserted through holes in the tubing, which correspond to perforations in the tangs of the axe. The casing is cracked and holed and its lower portion is missing. One half of the bottom rivet is also lost. The cutting edge of the blade has been damaged by corrosion. Both the blade and the casing are lightly patinated.
