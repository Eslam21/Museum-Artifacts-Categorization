The number A 1668 5 is written on a sticker glued to the exterior surface of the sherd. Pencil '405' on inside The dipinto dedication indicates the sherd as belonging to a Hera cup, of which a number were found at Naukratis. Hera cups appear to have been exclusive to Samos and Naukratis and Schlotzhauer has suggested that those found at Naukratis may have first been used at the Heraion in Samos and then brought to Naukratis as an aphidryma in the deliberate transplantation of cultic objects between sanctuaries (Schlotzhauer 2006 313). Following Furtw\u00e4ngler's typology of Samian Hera cups, the sherd belongs with his Type I-III (Furtw\u00e4ngler 1989 88, fig. 14). There are two modern drill sample holes for clay analysis on the break of the sherd. The sherd was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford and its fabric was compared with three other similar Hera cups (British Museum 1888,0601.401, 1888,0601.402 and 1888,0601.403) and all four were found to be of similar composition (Jones with J. Boardman in Jones 1986, p.665; p.701, table 8.18, no.48). The fabric from this cup was also analysed via NAA by Mommsen (Bonn) and the fabric was placed in Group J (Samos). Schlotzhauer suggests that these cups were produced in an area near the Heraion on Samos specifically for cult purposes (given the dipinto dedications) and these cups may even have formed part of the same batch, given the similarity of the cup shape and fabric.
