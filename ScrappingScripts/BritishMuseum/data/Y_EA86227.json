{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86227"], "Description": [" Scarab, made of beige steatite, parts on the back and on the sides by the legs chipped off. Light green glazing on all sides, darker green to turquoise in the incised hieroglyphs at the base. The surface shows small cracks on all sides. Division between head and prothorax shown by a curved line. The division between prothorax and elytra is not shown, same is true for the suture. The head is in the shape of a square turned on edge, no eyes visible. The clypeus with four lobes is shown slightly raised above the plates. The side shows two legs on each side, carved through two horizontal lines and a short vertical one, separating the scarab from its base plate. The seal at the base shows a circumferential line that is partly lost. On the left side a standing deity facing to the right, maybe Sekhmet with an uraeus at the head (?), holding a staff, standing on top of a nb-basket. Above her head a sun-disc, in front of her an unclear sign like jwn-pillar on a base line, underneath a small nb-basket. Perforated along its longitudinal side.
