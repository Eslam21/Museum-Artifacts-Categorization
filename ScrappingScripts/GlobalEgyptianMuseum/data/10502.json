{"Present location": "PELIZAEUS-MUSEUM [04/030] HILDESHEIM", "Inventory number": "1689", "Dating": "11TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ASIUT", "Category": "GRANARY (MODEL)", "Material": "WOOD; PLASTER; UNSPECIFIED", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; STUCCO; PAINTED", "Height": "30 cm", "Width": "29 cm", "Name": "Model of a granary", "Description": "The granary is surrounded by a wall and has an outward-opening door. Inside the courtyard is a flight of steps leading to six silos which are accessible from above. Four men are engaged in dragging sacks of grain up to the silos. One of them is shown emptying his sack, whereas two others have already emptied theirs. Another man is holding a grain measure, accompanied by an overseer who is distinguished by a stick and by the scribal equipment he carries under his arms. The squatting man is perhaps a scribe. The men are all represented with dark, reddish-brown skins and white knee-length kilts. They wear black wigs and, unlike men of higher social status who usually appear clean-shaven, painted beards."}
