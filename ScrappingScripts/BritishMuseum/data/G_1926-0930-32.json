{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.30"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of military officer on horseback. A military officer on horseback, at a festival. The horse, a stallion, walks to right on a low plinth, its left rear leg forward, its left foreleg raised, the so-called Spanish Pace. The officer, his body and head turned to front, wears a cuirass with pteryges, with the skirt of a short tunic below. He has a chlamys fastened at his right shoulder, covering his left shoulder; one corner of the cloak rests in folds on top of the horse\u2019s hindquarters. The rider wears a tightly woven bound wreath on his head, the ribbons of which fall onto his shoulders. His right arm is lowered, the palm of the hand uppermost, its back resting on the cloak. The harness is indicated in relief, with bridle and reins, a breastband with pendent circular trappings, and a girth-strap. Plain back with circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt, covered overall with a white dressing, thicker on the front than the back. Much colour survives: the horse is left white, as also is the cuirass and pteryges. The rider\u2019s flesh is painted pink. Details of the cuirass, pteryges, horse\u2019s harness (including the girth) and its mouth are picked out in red, and the eyes of both horse and rider are painted black. The ribbons of the wreath are painted green-blue and dark pink; dark pink is also used on the cloak where it rests on the horse\u2019s hindquarters, and green-blue on the edge of the rider\u2019s tunic. The spaces between the horse\u2019s legs are painted black (indicating night?).
