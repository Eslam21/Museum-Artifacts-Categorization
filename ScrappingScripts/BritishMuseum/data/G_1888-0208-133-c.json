Further fragments, not illustrated in the CVA, add nothing for shape or decoration. Size, profile, thickness, and outside decoration would pass for a Little Master cup, but the inside does not. Its slightly rough surface suggests some sort of closed pot, but from the position of one set of purple bands the opening must have been wide - a good bit wider than that of the 'plemochoe'. Further, the diameters of the floral zones show that the fragments come from two separate pieces. It is possible that we have here a variety of cup with a curving lid, but there is no known good parallel. Contemporary with late Siana cups."], "Bibliographic references": [" CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (Pl.
