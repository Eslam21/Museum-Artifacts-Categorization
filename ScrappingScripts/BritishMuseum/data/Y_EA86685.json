{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86685"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression, triangular in section, one side shows two rows of basketry coil, the other side shows one row of basketry coil on the rear, meaning that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay shows small inclusions of mica. The object was hardened after excavation. The top part shows a deep impression of a scarab-like seal and some finger prints as well as impressions of plant material around the seal impression. An almost complete impression of a scarab-like seal is visible. The motif is quite shallow but a row of five cobras facing to the left is visible, above them sun discs?
