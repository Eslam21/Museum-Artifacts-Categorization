{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA332"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Ipy: round-topped stela divided into two registers decorated in sunk relief and with incised texts. In the upper part the bark of Re\u2018 is depicted, above which are seven columns of text. Below are eight columns of text consisting of a prayer to Re\u2018 on behalf of the necropolis-workman Ipy who is shown kneeling on the right in adoration. The surface is much worn and friable. There are several gouges along the edges, one of which has resulted in some loss to the beginning of the prayer in the lower register, while two others on the right side have been repaired in modern times. There are no traces of colour.
