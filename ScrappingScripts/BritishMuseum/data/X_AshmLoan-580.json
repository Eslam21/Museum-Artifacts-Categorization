", " Lemos describes this sherd as having been produced using the light and dark technique. The vase was first slipped white, then black followed by painted decoration using added red and added white. Whilst the technique is commonly found on the interior of Chian open vessels, it is not frequently found on the exterior surface of vases. Thus this sherd stands out as one of a small number of Grand Style vases created using the light and dark technique. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
