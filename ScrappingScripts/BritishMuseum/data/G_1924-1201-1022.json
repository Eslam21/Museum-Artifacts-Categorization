", " The relatively thin wall suggests this may be from an oenochoe rather than a larger vase, but it could also be from a lid. Half rosettes are normally, though not always, pendant, not rising from the floor; if this were a lid the frieze would face inwards, which is unusual, but the graffito would be far more visible than one cut low on the wall.
