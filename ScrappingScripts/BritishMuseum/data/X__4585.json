", " The scarab is related to a series of scarabs and scaraboids produced at the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). This group consists of register compositions combining figural theme and inscription (on this common type of scarabs see Gorton 1996, 94, 105-107, type XXVIII C). This scarab however differs in its craftmanship of better quality and in the more accurate drawing of the hieroglyphs. Since the Scarab Factory was mainly active between 600 and 570 BC (see Webb forthcoming), Wahibre should rather refer to Apries. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
