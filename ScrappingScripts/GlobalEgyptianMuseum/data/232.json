{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.1522A", "Dating": "EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD/THINITE PERIOD (not before); OLD KINGDOM (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "BEIT KHALLAF", "Category": "DRILL", "Material": "FLINT/CHERT", "Technique": "ROUGH-HEWN", "Height": "6.2 cm", "Depth": "2.8 cm", "Name": "Crescent-shaped grinder", "Description": "Similar rough, rather thick, crescent-shaped bifacially flaked flint tools were found in large numbers at sites dating from the Early Dynastic Period and the early Old Kingdom (3rd Dynasty). They also appear in Predynastic contexts, however. These 'crescents' were probably set into a forked handle. Modern experiments suggest that they were perhaps used as rotating drill heads for hollowing out stone vases."}
