Chester. Acquired in the Fayum. Roman period, perhaps made about the time of a brief visit to Egypt in AD 176, when, according to the Historia Augusta, it is said of Marcus that 'among the Egyptians he behaved like an ordinary citizen, and like a philosopher, in all the academies, temples and public places' (Birley 1976: 134). This may account for him being shown wearing Greek clothes, a very rare occurrence indeed in representations of Roman emperors. As a (divine) emperor, such a figure would be a desirable addition to accompany other gods in a household shrine. Comparanda: Some confirming the identification, but not in terracotta, are noted in Bailey 1996a: 213n. 33.
