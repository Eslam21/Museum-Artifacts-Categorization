{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5773", "Dating": "22ND DYNASTY ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED", "Technique": "HEWN", "Height": "105 cm", "Width": "37.5 cm", "Depth": "58 cm", "Name": "Naophorous statue of a man", "Description": "This kneeling statue of a man, damaged in several places, is holding a shrine containing a falcon-headed deity. The man is recognizable as a High Priest of Ptah in the Great Temple of Memphis because of his hairstyle, which consists of a short curly wig with an additional tress on the right side of the head, the so-called lock of youth. This is a symbol of youthfulness for high-ranking or divine children, but in their case it hangs from a shaven head. The other indication of the man's rank is not clearly visible because it has been carved in very shallow relief and has suffered weathering. It is an animal skin, usually described as that of a dog, which is worn over the shoulder. The name of the person depicted has not been preserved in the surviving inscriptions. The style of the cutting of the round face with its fine details, large eyes, thin nose and smile all point to a date in the 3rd Intermediate Period. The statue greatly resembles a statue in Budapest of Shoshonk the son of Osorkon II, who held the post of High Priest of Memphis during the 22nd Dynasty. Perhaps the Vienna statue depicts the same person."}
