", " Griffin is a popular theme found on the scarabs and scaraboids produced at the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). This steatite scarab could have served as a model for the local production, or was also maybe produced locally. According to the theme and design, it seens to belong to Gorton's type XV A (Gorton 1996, 43-8). For another griffin, but of a different style, represented on a steatite scarab from Naukratis: see Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-EA.920.
