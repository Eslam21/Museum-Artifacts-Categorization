{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10920"], "Description": [" Papyrus. Demotic text recto and verso. The papyrus is torn on both sides and top and bottom, but there does still appear to be a margin at the top. On the recto there are 13+x lines of text. There is a space to the right, which, given the layout of the text on the verso, would suggest that other columns would have preceded it. On the verso there are the ends of 13+x lines of one column (writing very faded) and the beginnings of 11 lines of a second. The second column ends 4 cm above the broken bottom of the papyrus. Content uncertain, but it may be a mythological text of some kind.
