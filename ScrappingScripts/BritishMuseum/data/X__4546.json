This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Falcon, sometimes wearing a crown or with a flail, is a recurring motif for various compositions found on scarabs and scaraboids produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Though the hieroglyphic signs could have just some magical value, it seems more plausible that this is either a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun / Amun-Ra (on the cryptic writing of the name of Amun: Drioton 1957) or an abbreviated form for the Horus name of Psamtek II (H\u00f6lbl 1979, 165). This scarab belongs to a type, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII B, subtype B42-57a, see especially B42 for this piece). The hieroglyphs depicted on the underside can be found on several scarabs and scaraboids of various shapes discovered in Naukratis (Petrie 1886, pl.
