For the painting, see Bordeaux 66, who only knew an old copy. The original altarpiece, signed and dated 1727, commissioned for Winchester College, has since been found: see Christopher Rowell, 'Burlington Magazine', March 2012, pp.177-81. It is in reverse to the print. Cars's engraving was presented to the Acad\u00e9mie on on 3 April 1728, and is dedicated to the Duke d'Antin, the 'directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des b\u00e2timents et jardins du Roy', who was Lemoyne's patron."], "Bibliographic references": ["IFF / Inventaire du Fonds Fran\u00e7ais: Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, D\u00e9partement des Estampes (14)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["annunciation"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Virgin Mary ", " Representation of: Archangel Gabriel ", " Associated with: Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin "], "Acquisition name": ["Bequeathed by: Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode (CMC in Philipe's hand on the verso in oval blindstamp)"], "Acquisition date": ["1799"], "Acquisition notes": ["Although Philipe's marking is unambiguous, it is strange that the other large print after Lemoyne, which is very similar in presentation, is stated equally unambiguously to come from Sloane. No other prints after Lemoyne come from the foundation collections, and prima facie a Sloane provenance seems more plausible than a Cracherode, as Cracherode showed little interest in modern French painting."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["U,11.41"]}
