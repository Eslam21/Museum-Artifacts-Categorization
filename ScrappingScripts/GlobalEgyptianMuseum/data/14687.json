The upper part is broken, where there might have been a ceiling or acroteria, a small pedestal for statues or other ornaments. The lower part has broken areas as well. The stela portrays a man sitting on a rock with his legs crossed, his head turned to the right. He leans on his right hand, while the right arm rests on the right leg, which is shifted back while the left leg stretches forward, all in dynamic harmony. The man's posture indicates that he is deep in thought. It is likely that the man was one of the cultured people who lived in Ptolemaic Alexandria. The man is clad in a himation, a rectangular cloth draped over the left shoulder and about the body. The remaining part of his chest is left bare in the Greek style that was used to portray philosophers and thinkers"}
