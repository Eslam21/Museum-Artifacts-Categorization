The decorated face is divided into two registers and carved in relief, the inscriptions are incised. In the lunette is a single-winged disk on the left with an udjat-eye opposite on the right. The upper register shows Osiris seated on a throne with a table of offerings before him, he is not depicted in the usual mummiform manner. Before Osiris is Seshu offering a bunch of lotus flowers, buds and papyrus plants, he wears a short kilt over which is a longer skirt. Above the figures is an inscription.The lower register shows a man kneeling with his arms raised, he wears a short curling wig and long garment. Before him are five columns of inscription. The stela appears to have suffered in the programme of erasure carried out by the officials of Akhenaten, the name of Amun has been defaced."}
