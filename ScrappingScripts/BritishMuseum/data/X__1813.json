", " The lack of a rim prevents a definitive identification of the cup as a South Ionian cup with everted rim. However, the fabric and pattern find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type VIII (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-116). These cups coincide with Petrie\u2019s class L1 (Petrie 1886, 18) and the type closely follows the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. Hayes' Type VIII is of the same shape as his Type IX (only the interior decoration is different) which coincides with Schlotzhauer's (Schlotzhauer 2012) Type 9A and Vallet and Villard Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-88). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rim found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape.
