", " Considering its context of discovery, it should be dated to the 26th dynasty (on cobra amulets in glazed composition from the 26th dynasty: Andrews 1994, 76). Similar types of amulet however are still produced during the Ptolemaic period (Herrmann et al. 2010, 111). The registers of the McLean Museum & Art Gallery tend to allocate the Scarab Factory as a findspot for not only scarabs and scaraboids moulds, but also all types of amulets from Naukratis. Caution is therefore required for the dating and the findspot. Various Egyptian deities assumed the shape of a cobra (Andrews 1994, 34-35), so its identification as Wadjyt is uncertain.
