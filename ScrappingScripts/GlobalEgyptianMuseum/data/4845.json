This squatting female figure is almost totally preserved. The oval face is looking upwards and the facial features have only been schematically modelled. On the forehead, set below the smooth wig, is the hood of a broad uraeus in raised relief whose head has broken off. A knob on the top of the head was designed to secure a head-dress of bronze or copper, now lost. The figure wears a close-fitting garment. The rectangular base is almost as wide as the figure itself and tapers off towards the bottom."}
