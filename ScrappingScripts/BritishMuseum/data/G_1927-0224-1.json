{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1927,0224.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Harpokrates. Harpokrates seated on a low rough plinth, his legs to his right, the left leg flat on the ground, the right knee raised. Except for drapery on his right leg, he is naked (and obese) and grasps his large phallus with his right hand. An uncertain object rests by his left side, above which his left hand holds his pot to his left side. He has lost his head, which may have been made separately and pegged into a socket in his neck; his right foot has broken away together with part of the plinth. The back is flat and roughly finished. One-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt with a drab surface colour. Large areas were covered with a white dressing, the flesh is painted pink, and red paint survives on the object by his left side and between it and his body, with a trace on his pot; a black paint band encircles his lower neck at the break of the missing head.
