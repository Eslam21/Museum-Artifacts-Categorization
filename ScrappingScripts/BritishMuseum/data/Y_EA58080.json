{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA58080"], "Description": [" Serpentine(?) striding male figure on a slim rectangular base. The figure is depicted in a striding position with the left leg advancing slightly ahead of the right leg. The figure wears a long ankle-length kilt wrapped with a knot at the abdomen, with the stone incised with raised horizontal lines that create a striped pattern across the clothing and is enhanced with fringed detail along the waistline. The left arm is bent at the elbow with the hand placed on the figure\u2019s bare chest, while the right hand is placed flat against the side of the body. He has a shaven head, oversized ears, and wide almond shaped eyes. The nose is long and broad, with the outer corner of the mouth turned slightly downwards conveying a more serious expression. The chin is particularly prominent, and the facial features are asymmetrical with the left eye notably lower than the right side. On the reverse is a slim back-pillar which is uneven and tilts towards the right side, and is left uninscribed. At the top of the statue base in front of the figure\u2019s feet are two short lines of inscribed text, reading from right to left. There are chips to the ears and face, and various small scratches across the upper body, arms, and clothing. The figure has been attached to a modern rectangular base.
