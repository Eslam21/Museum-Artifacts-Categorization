Naukratis provided a similar motif on a scarab: Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H5115.7. The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). An exact parallel to this piece is provided by 1960,0514.45 (EA66151). Other scaraboids in the same shape, but displaying a different motif on the underside, are also attested (Hornung, Staehelin 1976, 331, no. 783; Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 492, ill. 272). Gardner, E.
