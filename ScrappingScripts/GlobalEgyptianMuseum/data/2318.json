The keyhole-shaped menat became an offering appropriate to the goddess Hathor, from its association with beauty and adornment. This example bears no trace of decoration. It was found in the temple to the cult of king Nebhepetra Mentuhotep, of the Middle Kingdom. The excavators dated it to the 18th Dynasty, about five hundred years later than the construction of the temple. Numerous votive offerings from the adjacent temples to the goddess Hathor appear to have been swept down into the Middle Kingdom precinct."}
