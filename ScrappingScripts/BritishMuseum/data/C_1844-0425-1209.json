Their design consists only of abbreviated legends. On one side this reads 'The queen the new goddess (Thea)'; on the other 'Antony consul for the third time'. This description of Antony dates the coin to 31 BC, and thus to the period of Scarpus of Cyrene, who changed his allegiance from Mark Antony to Octavian, and issued coins for both of them. The title given to Cleopatra may be an echo of that which appeared earlier on the silver tetradrachms produced in the name of Antony and Cleopatra."], "Bibliographic references": [" Svoronos 1904 / \u03a4\u03b1 \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd (The Coins of the Ptolemaic Kings) (1899) ", " Walker & Higgs 2001 / Cleopatra of Egypt: from History to Myth (232) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Cleopatra the Great ", " Named in inscription: Mark Antony "], "Acquisition name": [" Purchased from: William George Spencer Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire ", " Purchased through: Christie's ", " Purchased through: Harry Osborn Cureton "], "Acquisition date": ["1844"], "Department": ["Coins and Medals"], "Registration number": ["1844,0425.1209"]}
