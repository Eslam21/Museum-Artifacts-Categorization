{"artifact_name": "coffin", "Object Type": ["coffin"], "Museum number": ["EA6887"], "Description": [" Wooden face of a coffin: the large tenon at the top slotted into the wig, and a single wooden dowel through this held the face in position; a bituminous adhesive was also applied. Although the face represents a generic image of the resurrected dead person, it is, nonetheless, a superb example of wood-carving. The facial contours, in particular the cheeks, nose and mouth, have been rendered with great sensitivity. The eyes, inlaid with ivory and obsidian, with bronze cosmetic lines, give a wonderfully vivid and alert impression. The face is split down one side.
