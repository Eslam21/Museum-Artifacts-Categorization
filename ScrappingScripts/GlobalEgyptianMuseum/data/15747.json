The pectoral was worn as an amulet. The face of the pectoral is richly decorated with several scenes executed in relief. In one register, or section, the deceased is kneeling in adoration before the god of the afterlife, Osiris. On the other registers are funerary scenes.The pectoral has an oval hole in the upper part that holds a large green stone scarab, a color that symbolizes rebirth. The scarab rests on a lotus flower with two uraei, or royal cobras, on each side. The baboon god Thoth and other deities are shown on a large boat in the center of the pectoral. This scene symbolizes the journey of the sun god across the sky, because the scarab represented the sun god at dawn. The four corners of the pectoral are adorned by scenes of the adoration of several deities. The right-hand edge of the pectoral bears a line of divine determinatives, signs that give a clue to the meaning of words. The left-hand edge is adorned by the Djed, sign of stability, and the Tyet, a protective knot sign."}
