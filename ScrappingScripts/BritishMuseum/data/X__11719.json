{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Head of a female terracotta figure. Head fragment of a woman wearing a high decorated head-dress of the kalathos type worn over her long hair. Possibly a representation of a goddess. Her hair is worn up into a point at the front in Classical Greek style. The face is naturalistic, though the eyes are almond shaped and heavy lidded. Mould-made and hollow. Traces of a white residue, probably from a white coating preparation for paint, possibly traces of red paint. Cypriot yellow-buff clay with fine black and white sand inclusions.

This figurine is labelled in pencil with three characters, but only the third character (3) is readable. This object was registered with pieces labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary, during Gardner\u2019s season at Naukratis in 1885-1886. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary and '3' probably represents the context number in which it was found. A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary. Monloup, T. 1994.
