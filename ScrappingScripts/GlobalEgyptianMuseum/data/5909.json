Her left side is connected to the angular corner of a block of stone up to the shoulders, which on the back turns into the back pillar. The elongated back of the skull rests on this. The model probably comes from one of the workshops of el-`Amarna. The grid for the proportions was painted on the corner of the block of stone. The middle of the head is marked by a black line, as are the outlines of the eyes and the brows. The sloping ears have only been roughly worked out of the stone."}
