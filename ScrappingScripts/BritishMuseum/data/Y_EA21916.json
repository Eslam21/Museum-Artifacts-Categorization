{"artifact_name": "figure; trial-piece", "Object Type": [" figure ", " trial-piece "], "Museum number": ["EA21916"], "Description": [" Limestone head of a royal figure, likely a sculptor\u2019s model or trial-piece. The royal figure is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth, with the material tucked behind the ears and the long lappets that typically reach down below the shoulders now lost. A uraeus ornament depicting the cobra\u2019s coiled body is placed at the centre of the wig, with the snake\u2019s head lying flat just above the king\u2019s forehead. His eyes are small and slanted, and include a thin incised line indicating the upper and lower eyelids. The eyebrows are indicated by faint ridges along the forehead, while the nose is broad and the thick lips are curved into a small smile. The face is rounded and fleshy, particularly at the mouth and jawline. On the reverse, the surface behind the ears and headcloth is a flat plane. In addition to the breaks at either side of the nemes and damage to the right ear, there are chips to the figure\u2019s nose, chin, and mouth. There are also numerous small abrasions to the stone across the face, particularly at the eyebrows and cheeks, and to the band across the forehead of the headcloth.

Such models were used by the sculptor as an aid to ensure the production of an even three-dimensional sculpture; on the reverse of typical surviving trial-pieces, this area usually included an incised proportional grid, though this is not the case for this British Museum royal head. For the significance of the \u2018pendant snake\u2019 as opposed to the usually raised uraeus, see Hill (2007). Such objects are also suggested to have been used as votive offerings and deposited in temples (Silverman 1997), though the full process of such a practice is uncertain. The provenance for this particular example is not known, however is agreed to be Ptolemaic in date based on the small hoodless uraeus and the stylistic facial features (PM VIII; Russmann 2001).
