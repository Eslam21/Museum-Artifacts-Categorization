A mould-made model sword lacking its scabbard, with a ribbed handle with triple or quadruple balled pommel, the guard of pedimental form enclosing a raided stud. The blade has been pared. The back is plain except for a jog where the hilt meets the blade. There is some possibility that this is a sheathed sword, but it seems more likely that it is a sword alone. Solid, from two-piece mould. Traces of a white dressing, thicker on the handle than the blade; a splodge of white plaster covers the break at the tip of the blade. Orange-brown Nile silt with a red-brown surface and abundant fine gold mica and white inclusions.
