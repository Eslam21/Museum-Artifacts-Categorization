{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1911:406", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND", "Height": "15 cm", "Diameter": "6.5 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Tall pottery vessel with rounded base, gently convex profile, and wide mouth, from a New Kingdom shaft tomb burial at Abydos. It is one of a large number of vases placed in the north chamber of a plundered Middle Kingdom shaft tomb, reused in the 18th Dynasty. The excavator records that 'the chamber contained two bodies, that of a boy and a girl'. These New Kingdom burials had in turn been plundered, and the skull of the boy 'thrown into a corner and then broken with a stone', perhaps in the belief that this would prevent the dead from pursuing the robbers."}
