The material of which these amulets are made is often a dark hard stone, e.g. obsidian, basalt, dark limestone or slate. Its meaning is not entirely clear but has to do with where on the mummy it is placed. It is a purely funerary amulet and never occurs with a loop for suspension. The amulet is most often found near the incision in the belly, which was made to extract the intestines. It is possible that this amulet served to seal this incision and suggest the new wholeness of the body.This amulet shows traces of gilding."}
