The smile on the face is strongly indicated, giving a certain brightness to the whole face, and it contrasts strongly with the stiffness of the rest of the body. The woman stands with her left foot advanced and leans, both arms stretched alongside the body, on the back pillar, which is uninscribed. She is dressed in a long robe which is only discernible at the neckline and the top of the ankles."}
