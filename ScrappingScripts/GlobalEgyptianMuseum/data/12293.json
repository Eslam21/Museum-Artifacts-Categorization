He wears a smooth wig, that covers the upper part of his ears.On the front of the statue, on the lower legs of the man, is a scene carved in low relief: Osoroeris adores the triad of Karnak. Underneath are a few lines of text. The socle is higher under his bottom than under his feet. The statue has a back pillar, on which a text is engraved. Above, Osoroeris kneels, adoring Amun. There are two small inscriptions on the shoulders.The facial features are rather coarse and lack individuality. The two scenes are executed in shallow relief without details, reducing the figures to silhouettes."}
