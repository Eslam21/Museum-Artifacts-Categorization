", " Since it is said to have been found in the Scarab Factory, this mould could have served to cast some disk-shaped scaraboids. The letter P, painted in red, appears on many Boston objects, but does not correspond to provenance information. Glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at Naukratis were usually cast and not carved or incised; this technique, highly characteristic of Naukratite productions, allowed a mass-production of these small objects which were mainly intended for export in the whole Mediterranean area and even as far as Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 177-180, fig. 35). Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie published a range of moulds from the Scarab Factory, but none like this specimen (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 1-19). Gorton, A.
