{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7129", "Dating": "NAQADA", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "PALETTE", "Material": "SCHIST", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED", "Height": "17.8 cm", "Name": "Rhombic cosmetic (?) palette", "Description": "This rhombic palette with rounded corners is made of greywacke and has a symmetrical motif at the top (outwardly facing, stylized bird's heads?). It is crowned by \"horns\" surrounding a suspension loop. The body of the palette itself has two small holes pierced through the top. The shape is very unusual. It is very unlikely that this artefact was used for cosmetic purposes. It is more probable that it was a ceremonial object."}
