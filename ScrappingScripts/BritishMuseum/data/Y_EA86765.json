{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86765"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression. The fine brown Nile clay with some mica inclusions was hardened after excavation. The rear shows a concave surface with plant fibres, probably wood impression like a bolt or the base of a knob with one or two string impressions running perpendicular to the wood. In the break the impression of a twisted string with a width of 0.25 cm. The front side is slightly convex and covered with finger-impressions. A small part of an oval scarab-like seal-impression with a circumferential line is preserved, inside two small upright cobras underneath each other running of a central circled line like a cartouche. Small traces of the last sign, but not identifiable anymore.
