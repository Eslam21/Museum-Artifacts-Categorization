{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1899:341", "Dating": "NAQADA III", "Archaeological Site": "EL-KOM EL-AHMAR/HIERAKONPOLIS/NEKHEN", "Category": "JAR", "Material": "POTTERY", "Height": "27.5 cm", "Diameter": "13.5 cm", "Name": "Jar", "Description": "Pottery vase with flat base, convex profile and short, wide neck. There is a decorative, rather than functional wavy handle on both sides. There are remains of the original contents, aromatic fat placed in the grave for the use of the deceased in life after death. The vessel was found in one of the fourth millennium BC graves at the key early settlement near Kom el-Ahmar (the Hierakonpolis of later texts) in southern Upper Egypt. The rich tomb had white plastered walls and a roof of matting over a wooden frame. This and the other items of pottery date the burial to the last years of the process of state formation, when the culture of Upper Egypt extended over Lower Egypt, under a single kingship."}
