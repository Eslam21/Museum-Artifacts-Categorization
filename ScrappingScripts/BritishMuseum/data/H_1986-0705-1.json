Considerable numbers of Late Roman and Early Byzantine censers have been found throughout the Mediterranean and its hinterlands. Although these comprise many different forms, three body types for these censers predominate: cylindrical, hexagonal, or like the Glastonbury example, hemispherical. The closest parallels for the Glastonbury censer come from Sardis, Turkey, Catania in Sicily, and an unspecified findspot in Egypt (Waldbaum, J.C., 1983, \u2018Metalwork from Sardis: the Finds through 1976\u2019, Archaeological Exploration of Sardis Monograph 8, Cambridge, Massachusetts/ London, no. 585; Orsi, P. 1912, Byzantium Siciliae.

Regrettably, none of these examples come from reliable stratified contexts. An approximate terminus ante quern from the early to mid seventh century for this type is suggested for those with an eastern Mediterranean provenance: much of Sardis was destroyed by the Sassanian Persian attack of AD 616, and Syria and Egypt had come under Arab control by the 630s and 640s respectively. The occurrence of this example at Glastonbury is thus significant. It is said to have been found in the early 1980s during the digging of a service trench adjacent to, but outside, the abbey precinct. It has not been possible to localise the find-spot more precisely, but the Silver Street area is thought to be the most likely location. Byzantine copper-alloy vessels of closely related types and dates were certainly entering England in the late sixth and early seventh century, appearing as luxury items in burials. The explicitly religious character of this piece, which does not appear to be from a burial, suggests that it is to be seen in the context of the early Christian community at Glastonbury. The evidence so far available for the early archaeology of Glastonbury does not yet confirm that the abbey site was active before the eighth century, but from documentary evidence we know that the monastery itself was in being before 680. The presence of such a censer quite probably by the middle of the seventh century is an important piece of evidence for the early history of Glastonbury and its abbey.
