{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "GC123", "Dating": "5TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "SAQQARA NECROPOLIS", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Statue of a Noble Couple", "Description": "The two statues depict a seated man with his wife standing beside him. The artist probably chose this pose because the wife was much shorter than her husband so the artist did not want to show the big difference between them. The man is wearing a short plaited wig that hides his ears and the traditional kilt. He is seated on a high-backed chair with his hands on his thighs. The left hand is open while the right is closed around his kerchief. His wife wears another type of wig with stripes and a transparent, ankle-length lined dress. With her left hand, she holds the arm of her husband and her right hand lies on his shoulder to show her love for him."}
