Starting in the Middle Kingdom, the jars, called canopic jars by the Greeks, were provided with lids in the shape of human heads carrying the features of the deceased. In the New Kingdom, the lids took the forms of the Four sons of Horus: Amset (human), Duamutef (jackal), Hepi (baboon), and Qebehsenuf (falcon). These four deities respectively protected the liver, the lungs, the stomach and the intestines. These jars, also protected by four goddesses, were placed in a box next to the coffin. The jar of Mutpipu, chief of the harem of Amun, bears a text in three vertical columns which places the contents under the protection of the god Hepi and the goddess Nephthys."}
