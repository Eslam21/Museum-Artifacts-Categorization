Type 9B cups closely follow the shape and decoration of the Attic Plain Komast cups. These cups coincide with Hayes\u2019 Ionian Cup Type IX (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Villard\u2019s Ionian Cup Type B2 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). Type 9 cups have been found in large numbers in other sanctuary settings including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tocra, and at the site of Megara Hyblaea on Sicily. This type was the most common type of South Ionian cups with everted rims found at Naukratis. The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. The number 164 is written in ink on the exterior surface of the sherd. An inscription written in pencil on the interior surface of the sherd is difficult to decipher. Schlotzhauer reads \"NE\" but it is more likely \"NF\" followed by \"b...t\" followed by a series of numbers (over part of which the registration number has been written), ending with \"320\". Schlotzhauer also points out that the inscription on the rim is the only example at Naukratis of a dedication to the Milesian god Apollo of Didyma. ", " For the cult title Didymaios see A.
