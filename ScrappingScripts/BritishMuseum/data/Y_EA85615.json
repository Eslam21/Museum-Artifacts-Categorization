{"artifact_name": "figurine", "Object Type": ["figurine"], "Museum number": ["EA85615"], "Description": [" Lower part of a clay figurine, plaque type. On the lower front face is a fairly carefully marked pubic triangle formed of four rows of dots. Above this are two groups of three dots that lie close to the broken upper edge, but may be complete. They probably mark tattoos or scarification. The dots are consistent in shape and size, and have perhaps been made with a circular metal point. The figure is quite well modelled, with flat faces. The base is not perfectly flat, but as the figure is quite thick it may have stood upright. The dark brown mud is very fine and shows inclusions of mica. On the back face and in the break several cracks.
