A jug with a buff surface and similar painted decoration is published as Cypro-Phoenician (Folio Fine Art Ltd, cat. 50 (Dec. 1967), no. 144). The vessel is erroneously attributed to the site of Yeri-Phoenikiais in CVA 1, pl. 6.10. The shape resembles that of Swedish Cyprus Expedition Groups V and VI, both decorated and Plain White wares but the painted decoration cannot be paralleled in these groups (see SCE IV/2 passim)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (HB.01) ", " CVA British Museum 1 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 1, British Museum 1 (pl. 6.10) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.662"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 18 Jun 2012"]}
