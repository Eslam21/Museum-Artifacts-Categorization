The face is red with black details and wig, the collar in red, yellow, blue and black. Down the front is a single line of inscription. The pedestal is bevelled in front.Such wooden images were often included in the tomb equipment of private individuals during the Late Period but it was during the Old Kingdom that the cult of Ptah merged with that of another Memphite deity, falcon- headed Sokar, resulting in the funerary figure of Ptah-Sokar. By the Late Period this combined deity took on the aspects of Osiris to become the triune god Ptah-Sokar-Osiris."}
