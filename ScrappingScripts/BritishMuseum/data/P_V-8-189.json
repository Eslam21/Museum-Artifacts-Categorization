For the painting Federico made use of drawings by his older brother Taddeo: two sheets in the British Museum for the soldiers on the right are evidence of this (Gere and Pouncey nos 336-37). The engraving is, in some respects, closer to one of the drawings than it is to the fresco (Gere and Pouncey no.337). In particular the way that the elbow of the foreground soldier overlaps the right margin. This feature, which is such a crucial element in the effectiveness of the print, is quite different from the way that same figure is overlapped by the frame in the fresco. Federico reworked the image he had created for the Belvedere fresco, returning to his brother's ideas in the process. He was not satisfied just to reproduce what he had designed for the fresco. The plate was first published by Federico himself. Cort's own name does not appear until the 5th state, by which time the plate was in the hands of Antonio D. Salamanca (New Hollstein 18.V). The fact that initially Cort's work was given no explicit acknowledgment on the plate is precisely what had happened with his engravings of 1565-66 for Titian, and also happened with his 1567 St Francis receiving the Stigmata after Muziano. It draws attention to the fact that Cort's role as a reproductive engraver could be seriously undervalued and that he could be perceived merely as the person who enabled these artists to publish their original compositions in the form of prints. By the beginning of the 1570s this no longer happens and Cort is normally always credited. This is the first state. For the later state see V.8-188.
