{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA26706"], "Description": [" Limestone ostracon: the verso shows a lion's head sketched in black ink in profile; the space around it has been filled with less impressive attempts to draw a fledgling. Since this was a hieroglyphic sign used to write the word 'tja', \"fledgling,\" and other words containing the same sound, its shape had to be exactly right, from the open beak with tongue extended and the featherless little wings to the huge three-clawed foot and the tiny curl of a tail. The largest example, though not as well drawn as the lion head, looks like professional work. The corrections are made in red ink. The recto shows a throne.
