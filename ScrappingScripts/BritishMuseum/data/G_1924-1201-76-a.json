According to Perkins (2007) p. 60 #235, sherd 1924.1201.76.u belongs to same vessel as sherds 1924.1201.76.b-w but there is no mention of this sherd (1924,1201.76.a). Furthermore, there is no evidence that sherd 1924,1201.76.u joins any other sherd from group. If all sherds do join, then 1924,1201.76.a must also be included. Also according to Perkins, sherds 1888,0601.643b-d probably also join those listed above."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GL.128)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.76.a"], "Joined objects": [" Potential Join Group: G16684 (2 objects) "]}
