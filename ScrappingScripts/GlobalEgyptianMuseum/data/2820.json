{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:146", "Dating": "UNKNOWN", "Archaeological Site": "UNSPECIFIED", "Category": "ARCHITECTURAL DECORATION", "Material": "ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED", "Width": "5 cm", "Name": "Carved stone", "Description": "Fragment from a flat stone surface inscribed in high relief with a series of spiralling tendrils branching out from a central stem. Without analysis of the stone, it is difficult to assign this to a particular civilization, from among the several that used such motifs in their art. In the context of the cuneiform fragments L1030:143 and 144, this might be related to the elaborate scrolling beards of figures in Assyrian relief, but an Aegean, Egyptian or other origin would also be possible."}
