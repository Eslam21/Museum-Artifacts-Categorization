{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA66211"], "Description": [" Large heavy bronze axe-head: with relatively long blade, a convex butt and large thick lugs, both curved at the ends. The sides are almost straight but splay outwards quite sharply at the cutting end. The butt is expanded and flanged. The convex cutting edge is turned and blunted through heavy wear. The piece is thickly corroded, especially on one face, where the butt-flange has been largely eaten away, and there is superficial damage all over. Hammer marks are present on the sides, which are slightly faceted. One face, which had been cleaned before the axe's acquisition, bears a crudely incised inscription.
