{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA68392"], "Description": [" Fragment from the neck and shoulder of a vessel: an exact duplicate of 1894,0816.48. Of opaque yellow glass, glossy surface. Prefabricated 'eyes' of opaque dark blue, containing immediately within the circumference a single opaque white thread, were impressed into the outer surface at irregular intervals. The core is a darker tan than that of 1894,0816.48, therefore it is improbable that they are from the same vessel. The shape was probably an amphora with globular body.
