", " Cook suggests that Oxford AN1925.608b belongs to the same vase as Boston 86.636 and Cairo CG26152. In the first instance, it is unclear to which of two Oxford AN1925.608b sherds Cook is referring (this one or AN1925.608b(1)). The tongue band on AN1925.608b(1) is framed by narrow black lines and the circumference of the neck suggests that the vessel was a krater and not a closed vessel. On this one, there is added red on the lotus flower's kalyx and there is no evidence of added red on any of the other sherds, thus suggesting the sherd belongs to a completely different vessel. There is a single black band above the lotus flower and lotus bud on the Boston sherd. Finally, there is no narrow black band between the tongues and flowers on the Cairo sherd.
