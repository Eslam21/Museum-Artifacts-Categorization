{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA174"], "Description": [" Granodiorite seated statue of Senenmut holding Neferura: the steward Senenmut sits on a conventional blocklike seat and holds his royal charge on his lap. With his left hand, he grasps her firmly; with the right he draws his enveloping ankle-length cloak tightly around them both. Otherwise there is no interaction between the figures; Senenmut and Neferura gaze straight ahead. The princess's sidelock and the gesture of placing the forefinger of her right hand to her mouth are iconographic features indicative of childhood. The statue is inscribed on the legs and block-seat.

The invocation offerings on the front are given in the name of Amun, and seven aspects of the god are listed in the inscription on the proper left side of the seat. Therefore the statue probably stood somewhere in the precinct of Amun's temple, perhaps in the area of North Karnak, as one author has convincingly argued. In the inscriptions the names of Senenmut, Hatshepsut, and Amun are all intact, suggesting that the statue was buried out of harm's way before the periods when these names were attacked.
