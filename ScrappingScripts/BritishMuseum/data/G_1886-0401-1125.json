It also belongs to the same vessel as British Museum 1924,1201.36. For parallels regarding the scales, see Louvre A321 from Camiros. According to Cook, the decoration seems to have been inspired by the conventional representation of a bird, specifically a partridge: scales for the breast feathers and bars for the folded wings. The breast-feather panel narrowing towards the bottom and the red on these feathers are unusual; the black bands are unusually wide. For a complete oinochoe with this decoration, see Walter-Karydi 1973, pl. 4, no. 47 from Rhodes."], "Bibliographic references": [" CVA British Museum 8 / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain 13, British Museum 8 (p. 8, no. 1, pl. 8, no. 1) ", " Cook 1933-1934 / Fikellura Pottery (p. 40, no. 5) ", " M\u00f6ller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece (p. 247, no. 3a) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GF.148) ", " Walter-Karydi 1973 / Samische Gef\u00e4sse des 6.
