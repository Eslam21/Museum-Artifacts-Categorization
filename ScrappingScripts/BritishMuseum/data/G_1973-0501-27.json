A reclining naked figure with receding hair and a beard, but also breasts, and legs close together and bent, extending to the right. The left elbow and forearm rest on a pile of cushions, and the right hand holds a large phallus upright against the figure\u2019s right side, rising almost level with the top of the head. The breasts are prominent and the figure may thus also have female characteristics. It is modelled in relief with a flat back and was probably made in a one-piece mould. The detail is very worn and it is uncertain how much of a plinth has broken away. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a few traces of an overall matt red slip.
