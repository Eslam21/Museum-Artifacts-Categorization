{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86804"], "Description": [" Fragment of a very small seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The rear shows one side with three small coils of basketry and one side with one coil of basketry, suggesting that the piece was attached between the lid and the wall of a basket. The front side is flat and shows most parts of a small oval scarab-like seal-impression with a circumferential line. Visible is a lying sphinx, facing towards the left, wearing the double crown and a beard. Above its back an upright cobra with wings in a gesture of protection. Compare scarab EA86167.
