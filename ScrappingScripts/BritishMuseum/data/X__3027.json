", " The perirrhanterion is a special type of louterion (water-basin) used for ritual washing in sanctuaries (Pimpl 1997; Krauskopf 2005; cf. also Ginouv\u00e8s 1962, 77-103; Kurtz and Boardman 1971, 151). Excavations at Naukratis yielded a number of specimens in both stone (marble, bearing votive inscriptions to Apollo) and in ceramic, the latter of Corinthian manufacture.
