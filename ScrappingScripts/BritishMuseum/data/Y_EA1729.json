Both bore several priestly titles, but only Padineith is called vizier. Horiraa and Padineith were buried in the tomb of Bakenrenef at Saqqara, vizier under Psamtek I. Two centuries later, Padineith and his family usurped the tomb of Bakenrenef. The tomb has been excavated and published by an archaeological mission from Pisa. They also discovered the sarcophagus of Horiraa including the rest of the lid which joins perfectly to British Museum EA 1729. The lid mentions the name of Horiraa (line 4, 5), his mother Bastetirdis (line 5) as well as his father Pasherientaihet (with beautiful name Padineith) who was visier in the time of the First Persian Domination (line 3).
