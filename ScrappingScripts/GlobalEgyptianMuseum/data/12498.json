A necklace with a pendant in the shape of a lion's or panther's head is visible between the paws of the panther-skin. In his right hand, he brandishes a sword; his left hand holds a snake. The two disks on either side of his head are probably shields. The smaller female figure on the left does not carry any visible attributes (perhaps she was banging a small tambourine), but this should be Beset. The two figures stand on a ledge.The piece is executed in rather high relief."}
