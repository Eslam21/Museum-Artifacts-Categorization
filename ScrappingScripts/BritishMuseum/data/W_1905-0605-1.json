One cast of this was purchased by Cecil Beaton who later wrote to Mr Barber in the Cast Service asking for more information about the original (Barber q.v., 1962). For recent studies on Phoenician anthropoid sarcophagi, their contexts and cultural associations, see Frede 200 (the present item is her cat. XV.5) and Lembke 2001 (cat. no. 114), both with previous refs. Lembke dates it definitely to 440-420, though Frede cites the views of Kukahn (early 4th century BC) (1955, 41, pl.36) and Buhl (450-420 BC) (1959, p.41, pl.36). While several other examples of this type have been found in Egypt (see Lembke 2001, nos 113 and 115), the findspot of the present item is unclear and may have found its way to Egypt through the antiquities trade.
