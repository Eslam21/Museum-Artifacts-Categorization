", " Parallels, possibly from same mould series, from Arsos, Cyprus (Karageorghis 1999, pl. 34.1-7, Type III(i)8-21), or assigned to Arsos workshops. They are dated to between the mid 7th and early 6th centuries BC and found in Samos, Rhodes and Crete (Karageorghis 1999, 130-5). A number of Cypriot terracotta and limestone figures were sent by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to the British Museum and various other museums including this one. Many of these were labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from Gardner\u2019s excavations in 1885-1886. This is also confirmed by British Museum registers. This figure is from this group and so highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary.
