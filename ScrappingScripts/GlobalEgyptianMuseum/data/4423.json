{"Present location": "LIVERPOOL MUSEUM [03/061] LIVERPOOL", "Inventory number": "M13821", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "INCISED; POLISHED", "Diameter": "2 cm", "Name": "Walking stick", "Description": "The smooth upper part of a wooden walking stick or staff belonging to Ipuwy, Vizier of Egypt, on which the inscription has survived in full. The hieroglyphs are carefully carved onto the wood in a single vertical column and much of the original blue pigment which was used to fill them still remains. The wood appears originally to have been polished and is now split slightly in places. There are two other examples of walking sticks/staffs in Liverpool Museum but neither of them is inscribed.Straight staves were carried by the men of ancient Egypt, soldiers and civilians alike and were used accordingly as either a weapon or a walking stick. They appear to have been between 4-5 feet in length and varied in style from the smoothed branch of the peasant to the slim, polished stick carried by a noble."}
