{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA26"], "Description": [" Quartzite sandstone naophorous statue of Sety II: seated on a throne, holding on his knees a shrine surmounted by a ram's head, emblem of the god Amun-Ra. Despite damage on the face of the ram and the head of the uraeus, this is one of the most complete sculptures from ancient Egypt. The king wears a shoulder-length wig with longer strands in front and a uraeus on the forehead. The pleated kilt is held by a large belt bearing a rhomboid decoration, from the back of which emerges a piece of pleated material. An animal tail, hanging between the legs and sandals, completes the royal attire. The narrow throne with low back is equipped, exceptionally, with a cushion, on which the king sits. The sides of the throne are decorated with the heraldic plants of Upper and Lower Egypt, bound together to symbolize the union of the Two Lands. These plants are generally placed to correspond with the direction of the statue and occupy the same position on each side. Here, however, their positions are inverted: on the throne's right side we find the papyrus near the back and the lotus near the front, while on the left side, we observe the contrary. In spite of the cushion, the seated attitude is rigid. The sculpture is static, with elongated proportions, a slender torso, and oversized limbs. The oval face, with full cheeks that fall heavily toward the broad chin, has a stern expression. On the wide forehead, the eyebrows, carved in relief, are arched and lengthened by tapering cosmetic bands. Similar lines, in shallow relief, frame the eyes. The straight nose surmounts a horizontal mouth with lips of equal length articulated by finely raised ridges and a small hollow at each corner. The head is set on a straight neck that is narrowed by the plunging flaps of the wig and, in profile, seems to disappear completely. Large, rounded shoulders, marked by converging grooves to indicate the deltoid muscle, dominate the torso. Two oblique ridges mark the clavicles, and a summary modeling renders the chest. The waist is thin, framed by massive arms and schematic hands with long, parallel fingers whose nails are depicted with care. The treatment of the elongated legs is more elaborate, with delicately modeled knees and well-defined muscle and bone structure. The well-sculptured feet are shown wearing sandals with pointed soles and thick straps in high relief. The royal names are engraved on the shoulders. There is a text on the statue's back. The royal titulary is also inscribed around the base.
