{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10754,7"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum 1"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum 1, Frame 7. Papyrus written on the recto in hieratic script. The recto contains the literary text The Discourse of Sasobek, while on the verso there are some later accounts. The text is written in vertical columns with a horizontal line for the title. This frame contains lines Bi 16-17 and Bi 24-27. The papyrus was a full-height roll. Gardiner describes this papyrus as follows: 'This admirably written literary text, of which the upper halves of a hundred columns are still preserved, contained a moralizing text, doubtless introduced, like the Maxims of Ptahhotpe and the Prophecies of Neferti, with a brief narrative. Dr. Barns' investigation has shown Newberry's arrangement, especially near the beginning, to be incorrect in places; he has also succeeded in finding the positions of many fragments belonging to the lower halves. Nevertheless, no less than seventy fragments remain unlocated, some of them giving several consecutive words. Hence this composition, once no doubt of great linguistic and literary importance, now represents an irreparable loss' (Gardiner, The Ramesseum Papyri, 1955, 8). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
