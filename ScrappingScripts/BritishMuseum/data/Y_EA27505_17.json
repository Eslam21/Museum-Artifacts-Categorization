XXV-XXVI; Weinstein 1973, 376-378, no. 158). The content of these deposits is purely Egyptian in nature and is very similar to that of Late Period foundation deposits (see for example those discovered at Tell Nebesheh, Gemaiyeni and Tell Defenneh: Petrie 1888, 14-15, 40-42, 54-55, pl. V-VI, pl. XIX and XXI-XXIII). Naukratis foundation deposits can be further compared to several foundation deposits, mainly dated between the reigns of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Ptolemy IV, and discovered in various temple complexes of the Delta, at Coptos and in the Theban region (discussed in: Weinstein 1973, 352-363, Group I). The foundation deposits of this pylon provided several rectangular plaques made in various metals and stones, as well as fragments of raw material, such as lapis lazuli and turquoise. Models of mud brick pertain to the same range of material and they constitute a regular element in foundation deposits from the Middle Kingdom onwards (Weinstein 1973, 356). Three models of mud brick were discovered in total: one in the north-east corner, one in the south-east one and one in the north-west one (Petrie 1886, 31, pl. XXV no. 21). According to Petrie\u2019s list, this object was found at the north-west corner of the pylon. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
