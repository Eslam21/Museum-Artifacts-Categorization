Chalices that fall into this group are usually large and heavy-walled and are also known as chalice-kraters. Chalices in this group display elaborate compositions that include polychromy and delicately painted figures (Lemos 1991, 90-1). The sherd joins British Museum 1888,0601.182 and belongs to the same vase as British Museum 1924,1201.15. This newly discovered join with 1888,0601.182 calls into question the published inscription in Hutton, C. A. 'Inscriptions on pottery from Naukratis', Classical Review 7, 1893, 83, IV because the iconography from this join makes clear that 1888,0601.182 goes to the left of 1924,1201.15."], "Bibliographic references": [" Price 1924 / Pottery of Naukratis (pl. 10, fig. 9) ", " Walter-Karydi 1973 / Samische Gef\u00e4sse des 6.
