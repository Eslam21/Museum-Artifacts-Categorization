Scarabs and scaraboids decorated with a winged lion or sphinx on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 20-31, see especially no. 25 for this piece; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, no. 16 and 62) and according to his annotations on pl. XXXVII, no. 25, there were two examples of this specimen, in yellow paste and from the Factory (marked 'F' on the drawing). This type of scaraboid was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 93-107, type XXVIII A, subtype A191-193). Gordon misidentified the scaraboid AN1896-1908-EA.914 kept in the Ashmolean Museum with Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 25. Gardner, E. A. 1888, Naukratis.
