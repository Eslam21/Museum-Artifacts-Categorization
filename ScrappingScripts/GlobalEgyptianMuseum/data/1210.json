In accordance with their magical concepts, these objects were used by the deceased and protected them against all attacks of \"Evil\" in the Afterlife. Amongst the statuettes and figurines have been found mourners. The Brussels Museum posseses four figurines of mourners in terracotta, which date from the 1st Intermediate Period. The women are very characteristic: they are striking the naked breast, raising their arms in despair or are bent by grief. This second piece depicts a mourner, dressed in a high-necked dress, her two hands at her breast."}
