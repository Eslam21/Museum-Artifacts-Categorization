{"Present location": "BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA ANTIQUETIES MUSEUM [01/027] ALEXANDRIA BAAM", "Inventory number": "429-430-431-432-433", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "MASK", "Material": "GESSO", "Technique": "STUCCO", "Name": "Stucco Masks from the Ptolemaic Period", "Description": "A collection of stucco masks, some with the eyes empty while others have them painted. The masks show the head and the neck only. They were usually put on the recumbent mummy. They were made by casting the stucco in molds. Coal was used to color the hair black, while gold was used to paint jewelry such as earrings, necklaces and head bindings. There are numerous examples in which the mask is completely painted with gold. It is obvious that these masks have been refurbished."}
