They portray the king with a young face but differ in details such as the hairstyle or the headdress the statuette is wearing.This gilded wood shawabti wears a short curly Nubian-style wig of the sort that was reserved for use by the royal family, both men and women.The royal uraeus was probably inserted in the small hole on the forehead below the gilded band of the headdress. The scepter that the statuette holds is made of bronze but the flail, the other item of royal insignia, has been lost.The four columns of inscriptions on the statuette are the formula of Chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead, in which the deceased requests his shawabti to respond in his place when Osiris calls him to work in the fields of the afterlife"}
