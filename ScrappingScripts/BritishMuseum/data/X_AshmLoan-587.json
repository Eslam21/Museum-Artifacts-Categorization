", " Lemos describes the sherd as being in the style of the W\u00fcrzburg chalices, but dated later than those chalices because she considers the style of the drawing to be debased and because of the elementary and isolated interior decoration (Lemos 1991, 72-3). There is a modern drill hole on the break where fabric was taken for study purposes. It was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it was found that the fabric originated in the Kampos plain in the east of the island of Chios (Jones 1986, p.286). Jones identificatied the sherd as being in the Chalice Style, but it firmly belongs within the earlier Wild Goat Style. "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
