", " Faces of kings in the round were a popular topic amongst sculptor's models, particularly in the 30th dynasty and early Ptolemaic Period (for similar pieces made of plaster or limestone: Tomoum 2005, 215-216, Pl. 33, nos. 46-47; see also Pl. 79, no. 157 for a plaster face of jackal with deep depressions for eyebrows and eyes). The style of the face, esp. the smile, is quite typical of the 30th dynasty. It was a practice piece, made and used in a sculptors' workshop (on nature and functions of this type of model: Tomoum 2005, 42-55, esp. 48-49 for the composite statues theory; see also Ashton 2014 for a different interpretation regarding king's heads and busts within the category of sculptor's models). Sculptor's models of different types were discovered in Naukratis, suggesting the presence of such workshop on the site. See BM 1886,0401.1566, for another model in plaster discovered in Naukratis.
