{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1908:490", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "MIT RAHINA/MEMPHIS", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED RECEPTACLE", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "4.5 cm", "Diameter": "2.8 cm", "Name": "Top of a 'new year jar'", "Description": "The neck of a New Year flask, in the form of a papyrus umbel, with incised decoration. The green surface of the faience is marked by a brown deposit in the incisions, of uncertain character. New Year flasks were produced in great quantities in the late 26th Dynasty (sixth century BC). Their purpose is uncertain, but they often bear an image of the goddess of the primeval flood, Mehetweret, in the form of a cow, as well as hieroglyphic inscriptions invoking the principal gods of Memphis for a good New Year. The Egyptian New Year fell at the midsummer rising of the Nile, and it seems plausible that the flasks were intended to contain river water taken early in the inundation."}
