This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " The owl sign is often associated on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids with solar symbols (see example of an owl between an obelisk and sun-disk in Gorton 1996, 103, no. 84) or other sacred signs (Maat feather, ankh sign: Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 42; Gorton 1996, 104). Though the hieroglyphic signs have often just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic reading for the name of Amun-Ra. The scarab was attributed to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, notably on Punic sites and in the Levant (Gorton 1996, 112-114, type XXXI, subtype 20-25, see particularly 23 for this piece). It fits, however, better Gorton's Type XXX A (see notably type XXX A1 from Carthage).
