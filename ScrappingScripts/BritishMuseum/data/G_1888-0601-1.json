Its magic was used \u2018to attract lovers and call back faithless lovers\u2019. Iynx-wheels and representations of them were used as votive gifts before marriage, during courtship as a lover\u2019s gift or as in this case as grave goods (B\u00f6hr 1997, 116-20). 'A iunx consisted of a string with a wheel attached, which span when the string was pulled. It served as a magic love charm, intended to arouse desire. The copper ring was probably made by skilful hammering or, perhaps, by casting. The design was then chased into the bezel and mercury-gilded; finally, the flat surfaces were burnished. This is one of the earliest examples of mercury gilding' (Williams and Ogden 1994; bronze and mercury gilding analysis see Craddock 1977, 109-10; see also Boardman 1970, pl. 723, shape vii; Nike Group; Ogden 1987, pl. 9 left, upper left).
