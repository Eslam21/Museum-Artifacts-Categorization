The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white.

Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios. The Decorated Styles (p. 111, p. 276, no. 741, pl.
