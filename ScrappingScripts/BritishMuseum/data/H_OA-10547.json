Waywell (eds), Sculptors and Sculptures of Caria and the Dodecanese, London, 1997, fig. 2. Comparable examples: National Portrait Gallery, London (K. K. Yung, National Portrait Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue 1856-1979, London, 1981, no. 973), plaster dated 1863, presented by Miss Amy Frances Yule, 1895; plaster in possession of Frances Carey signed and dated 1863 (see Dawson 1999, p.148, figs 39-41), formerly belonging to G. F. Watts, who accompanied Newton to Halicarnassus(1) Sir Charles Newton,(2) who was born at Clungunford, Shropshire, the son of a vicar, was educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford. He was appointed as an assistant in the Department of Antiquities at the British Museum in January 1840. In 1848 he visited Florence, Naples, Rome, Siena, Pisa, Bologna, Vienna and Munich, as well as Athens, to 'examine antiquities in situ'. He resigned in 1852 to become vice-consul at Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, then consul at Rhodes in 1853-4.(3) In 1854-5 he conducted excavations on the island of Calymnos, proceeding to Bodrum, Turkey, where he discovered the site of ancient Halicarnassus. Such was the pressure of space at the Museum that reassembly of the principal sculptures which he excavated from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and sent to London took place on the Museum colonnade where temporary sheds were erected. After excavating Cnidus and sending home another large consignment of sculptures, Newton was appointed consul at Rome in 1859, subsequently returning to the Museum as Keeper of the new Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities from 1861 to 1885. He was Yates Professor of Classical Archaeology at University College London from 1880 to 1888, and helped to establish the Hellenic Society, the British School at Athens and the Egypt Exploration Fund. A romantic oil portrait of Newton dating from around 1850 by Henry Wyndham Phillips is in the British Museum.(4) G. F. Watts included an extraordinary depiction of Newton as Edward I clad in chain-mail under a robe in a mural entitled Justice Hemicycle of Lawgivers in the Hall of Lincoln's Inn.(5) A marble portrait plaque of Newton to right aged seventy-one, signed by Waldo W. Story and inscribed Rome 1888, was offered in 1929 to the National Portrait Gallery, London. It now belongs to the Hellenic Society at Senate House, University of London.(6) A drawing by Randolph Caldecott (1846-86) entitled Ceremony of Removing a Piece of Sculpture in the British Museum, showing a rather stooped Newton in a top hat accompanying two masons, was reproduced in an undated twentieth-century folder of prints entitled The Old British Museum, and was used in the British Museum calendar for 1964.(7) There is a photograph of Newton, older, in profile to right.(8) For information about Sir Joseph Boehm, see registration no. 1891,0613.27. This, one of Boehm's earliest portraits after his arrival in England in 1862,(9) was modelled in 1863 and exhibited the following year; it has not yet been discovered how the original commission arose. However, it is likely that Newton's marriage to Mary, daughter of the painter Joseph Severn, and his friendship with Frederic Leighton and G.F.Watts(10) played a part in the genesis of the bust. Amongst Boehm's first portraits exhibited at the Academy in 1863 were a plaster and a bronze statuette of John Everett and Effie Millais respectively.(11) The Newton bust was not carved in marble until Lord Carnarvon raised about \u00a3460 for a testimonial to the sitter. In a letter to The Classical Review on 22 March 1889(12) J. Henry Middleton of King's College, Cambridge objected to the money being used for a bust, voicing an opinion which was shared by many of his contemporaries: The modern type of head, and fashion of hair and whiskers, are unsuited to plastic art, especially in marble; and, secondly, no modern branch of art is more commonly unsuccessful than that of eikonic sculpture. . . . Though we have much reason to be proud of the works of many of our living English artists, it is surely in the production of portrait-busts that the present age is least successful. Despite the publication of Middleton's letter, around \u00a3130 was spent on the bust, the remaining 'about \u00a3330' going to the British School at Athens.(13) The flecks in the clothing and hair, where the marble is slightly brownish-toned, contrast with the whiteness of the face. Susan Walker has suggested(14) that the sculptor has cut away all the imperfections in the flesh areas, leaving a deliberate contrast between the two surfaces. The slight turn of the head, delineation of the pupils, rather wild wavy hair and untidy knot all demonstrate that Boehm was capable of interpreting his sitters in a lively and rather romantic fashion, whilst maintaining his concern for sartorial realism evident in the careful carving of the waistcoat and jacket. Boehm's delineation of the pronounced concavity of Newton's face is further evidence of his pursuit of realism. Few of his portraits are more sympathetic. Both bust and socle are of marble from Polvaccio, Torano basin (E.Dolci, Carrara Cave Antichi: Materiali Archeologici, Carrara, 1980, no. XII, p. 163). Notes: (1) For Watts, see I. Jenkins, 'G. F.
