{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 26211", "Dating": "AMENHOTEP I/AMENOPHIS I/DJESERKARE", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "MALE MUMMY", "Material": "ORGANIC", "Technique": "GENERAL TECHNIQUE", "Name": "Mummy of Amenhotep the First", "Description": "The king was originally buried at Dra-Abu'l Naga. During the Twenty-First Dynasty, his mummy, which was in poor condition, was moved to Deir el-Bahari.The mummy was carefully wrapped in bandages and covered with a mask, which is still in place together with garlands of flowers. An X-ray shows that the king apparently died in his late forties and was perhaps 1.79 meters, or about 5 feet 10 inches, tall. The mummy's hands, although broken off, were crossed over his chest, a posture traditionally used by all of his successors."}
