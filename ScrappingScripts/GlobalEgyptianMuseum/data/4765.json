The material of which these amulets are made is often a dark hard stone, such as. obsidian, basalt, dark limestone or slate. Its meaning is not entirely clear, but has to do with where it was placed on the mummy. It is a pure funerary amulet and never occurs with a loop for suspension. The amulet is most often found near the incision in the belly, which was made to extract the intestines. Maybe this amulet was intended to close the incision and thus emphasise the new wholeness of the body.The amulet is worked on both sides."}
