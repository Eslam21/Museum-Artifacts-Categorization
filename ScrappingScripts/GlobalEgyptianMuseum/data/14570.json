Sometimes their stoppers were adorned with four different heads: a man, a falcon, a baboon and a jackal. In other cases, they had four human heads, like this collection. In such case, they are recognized by their names, which are inscribed on the jars. These four heads are clean-shaven and are wearing large wigs that leave their ears uncovered. Above the heads, there are some traces of hieroglyphics, written in black ink."}
