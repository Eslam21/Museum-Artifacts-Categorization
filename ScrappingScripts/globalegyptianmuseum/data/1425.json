It depicts a princess carrying a standard with a vase decorated with flowers. This specific type of offering is very common in the banqueting scenes of Akhenaton and Nefertiti. The princess is wearing a short Nubian wig which still preserves some traces of blue colour. She is wrapped in a garment that covers the lower arms. We can just make out the king in front of her, wearing a garment wrapped around himself and fastened with a belt."}
