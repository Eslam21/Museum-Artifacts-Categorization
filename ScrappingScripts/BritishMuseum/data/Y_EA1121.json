The original is now in the Cairo Museum. The Piankhy stela cast was purchased together with casts of several other objects from the Cairo Museum in 1891 by the then-Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum, E. A. Wallis Budge. Budge's archive papers (AES Ar.603) provide a list of the casts obtained from the Cairo Museum. In a letter dated 8 April 1891, German Egyptologist E. Brugsch notes that the casts are all finished and packed and will be forwarded the next day. The Piankhy stela cast was registered in the British Museum on 14 October 1893 along with the other Cairo casts. Published: Regulski, I. (ed.), 2022.
