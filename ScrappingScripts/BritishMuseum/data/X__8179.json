", " Dome-shaped weights, including sub-domed types, represent one of the most common weights found in Naukratis, and elsewhere in Egypt (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201csub-domed\u201d type; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). They are often made out of igneous rock such as basalt and diorite \u2013 which is the case for this specimen. Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 26). Dome-shaped weights, and related types, are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g) and their multiples or sub-multiples. However, other standards can be found. This specimen could be linked with the Royal Hebrew shekel, around 11.3 g (Kletter 1998), or more probably, according to its context of discovery, with the Persian silver siglos around 5.3 and 5.6 g. Weights, which seem to be based on such standard at Naukratis, are not different in shape nor material than the weights based on deben-kedet (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII; Cour-Marty 1990, 24).
