The modelling is rather flat, but the contours of several parts of the body, such as the stomach and the left knee, are visible underneath the tunic. In his left hand he holds a garland, and his right arm is placed on his chest; the hand clutches a sort of stole. The statue is purely roman in tradition, and was intended to be placed in a niche. Several parts of it retain traces of polychrome paint."}
