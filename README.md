 ## Description 
Archaeology involves studying the human past through artifacts like stone, bone, pottery, etc. 
Practitioners classify artifacts based on date, cultural attribution, and socioeconomic significance. Computer applications, particularly machine
learning models, have been introduced to enhance this process for automated archaeological classifications (Derech et 
al., 2021; Tal, 2014). Our project presents a comprehensive approach to the classification of 
museum artifacts, focusing on Egyptian monuments. The methodology involves collecting and 
combining visual and tabular data on Egyptian artifacts. Progress on this 
challenge improves the tools of a museum curator while improving content-based exploration
by online visitors of the museum collection.
