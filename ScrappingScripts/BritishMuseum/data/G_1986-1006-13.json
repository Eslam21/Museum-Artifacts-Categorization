Two priests carrying a shrine, probably of Harpokrates. Both are bald and wear high-waisted, long garments, and support the shrine on their shoulders with both hands. The shrine has a cobra cornice and an open door, and contains a very obscurely rendered, apparently unclothed, deity, very probably Harpokrates. Between the priests\u2019 feet is a pot. The group stands on a plain, flatfronted plinth. The back is plain, with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a grey core.
