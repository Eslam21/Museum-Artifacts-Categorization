The front is stylised and in the likeness of an extremely hard to identify insect -- possibly a fly. The wings are recognisable, but the other elements of the insect are not clearly identifiable. There is a hieroglyphic inscription on the reverse, and according to J. Vercoutter, it should be understood as ''Given by Re''."}
