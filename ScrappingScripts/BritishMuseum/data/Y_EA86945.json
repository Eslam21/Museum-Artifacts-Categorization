{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86945"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and partly a glossy surface. The rear shows a concave impression of wood probably from a peg. Impressions of a turned string with a width of 0.2 cm in the break. At the flat upper side half of an impression of a very small oval scarab-like seal is visible. It shows a circumferential line, at the bottom a nb-basket and above the head of a ram, facing towards the left, wearing a crown that is not very well visible but looks like a double feather crown. There are many finger impressions around the seal. Same motif can be found on EA86810 and EA86949.
