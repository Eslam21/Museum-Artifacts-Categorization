{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1905:266", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "SARABIT EL-KHADIM", "Category": "SCARAB", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "0.8 cm", "Width": "1.1 cm", "Name": "Scarab", "Description": "Small objects were deposited at the temple of Hathor as votive offerings by Egyptians during expeditions to Sinai. Items from Petrie's excavations now in Dublin include, exceptionally, a series of small scarabs. This example has a rounded head and a plain, crudely cut back. There are indistinct signs on the underside, including the hieroglyph for 'gold', often used in scarabs as a talisman, gold being the metal that never tarnishes and accordingly, in Egyptian texts, the flesh of the gods. It is also a name for the goddess Hathor, originally perhaps as the sun-filled sky."}
