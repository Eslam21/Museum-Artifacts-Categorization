This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " No provenance, but Bolton Museum register suggests that the piece might be from Naukratis. Parallels from Naukratis in Bolton Museum (1966.92.A), Bristol Museum (H2223.b), Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA580 and NA578) and the British Museum (GR1886,0401.1543, GR1886,0401.1458, ME1885,1010.28). There is a cruder figure in plain shrine also thought to be from Naukratis (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1896-1908.E4679). Similar example from Memphis and elsewhere in Egypt are given Late Period or early Ptolemaic dates (Higgins 1954, 404; Bayer-Niemeier 1988, 148-9, pl. 40.1-5, no. 263-7; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, 137-9, pl. 108-9, no. 202-209). Similar example from the Fayum (Kaufmann 1915, no. 268). Similar limestone carving dated Saite to beginning of the Ptolemaic period, with the shrine supported by Hathor-columns, with Bes-figures on high pedestals flanking the goddess (von Bissing 1931, 18, points out that this type of wig was most popular in Saite times). Another small limestone relief from Tell el-Yahudiya in the British Museum, (British Museum EA 1875,0517.100) is similar, but has papyrus-columns, and the figure of the goddess stands between a gate with a broken lintel, which supports sistrum-like Hathor-capitals. Hathor-capitals are also found on a limestone shrine from Athribis, from a late third to 2nd century BC context (My\u015bliwiec 1996b, 10, fig. 2). Several figures from Mendes are similar, some within a shrine, from 4th to 3rd century BC context (Redford 1988, 67, pl. 22d). Various similar examples (Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie Museum UC50489), including one dated Late Period and early Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 203). The shrine compares with a probably 3rd to 2nd century BC example with Bes- pillars and lions (or sphinxes), but with Athena in the temple (LIMC iii (2), pl. 77:22). Bayer Niemeier, E. 1988.
