{"Present location": "MUSEO ARQUEOL\u00c3\u201cGICO NACIONAL [21/007] MADRID", "Inventory number": "16169", "Dating": "GERZIAN", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "VASE", "Material": "POTTERY; CLAY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; BURNED, OXIDIZED; PAINTED", "Height": "8.5 cm", "Diameter": "7.6 cm", "Name": "Decorated vessel", "Description": "This globular vase, with a stable base and side handles, is the most interesting Predynastic pottery kept in the Museum. It presents an harmonious decoration of geometric, human and nature inspired motives, not common for this kind of jar. On the vase shoulder there are intertwined lines and, drawn underneath, two scenes displayed in two registers separated by mountains schematically depicted. In the upper register there are three human figures between animals, two of which are holding an object in their hands. The lower register shows an \"animal parade\" with a human figure at the front. These scenes have been interpreted as hunting or shepherding scenes, depending on how one identifies the goats and antelopes."}
