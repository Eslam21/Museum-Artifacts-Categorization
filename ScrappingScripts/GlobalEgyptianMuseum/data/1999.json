The tilapia was considered an emblem of birth and rebirth, holding its eggs in its mouth. The motif enjoyed particular popularity in the 18th Dynasty. This figure was found at the temple of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari, focus of the cult of the goddess Hathor on the West Bank at Thebes. Numerous votive offerings to the goddess were left by men and women, probably seeking the safe birth of a child. The offerings include a high proportion of blue faience items, presumably a material and colour associated by the Egyptians with fertility."}
