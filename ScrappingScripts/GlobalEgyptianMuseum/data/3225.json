The stone is irregularly shaped, quite rounded, it is possibly from a statue or a column. To the right of the cartouche the outer line of another can clearly be seen, the rest of the titulary of the Aten. This piece probably dates from before Year 9 of Akhenaten's reign, it was approximately at this time that the use of Re-Harakhty and Shu in the name-form was no longer used in the god's official titulary (see General Comment in Advanced Mode/Reference).
