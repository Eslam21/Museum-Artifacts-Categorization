XIV, no. 2; Masson forthcoming). When complete, it would have represented a kneeling offering bearer raising up his hands and carrying above his head a bounded ibex (Wallert 1967, pl. 39, no. K20). Parallels of the Saite-Persian period are found in the Delta, especially in Sais (Wallert 1967, 45) and Memphis (Anthes 1965, 102, pl. 38c-d, no. 50). Offering spoons are a category of artefacts well represented in the Delta. I. Wallert listed Bubastis, Tanis, Zagazig, Sais, Saqqara and Memphis (Wallert 1967, 53). The iconography displayed on these objects is often linked with offerings or the act of offering and they are often associated to deities of fertility and regeneration (Bult\u00e9 2008).
