XXI no. 791), the sherd was excavated in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite but the modern inscription 'DERA' (sic) incised on the interior surface points to the sherd having been found in the Sanctuary of Hera or Dioskouroi. Gardner (1888 p. 47) suggests that the vessel probably originated from Mytilene or Lesbos because of the dialect of the inscription on the sherd. The fabric finds parallels with British Museum 1888,0601.637 which was analysed with NAA by Hans Mommsen (Bonn). The results placed the fabric (sample NAUK 64) in NAA group G and the origin was determined to be Aeolis.
