{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.4063", "Dating": "PTOLEMAIC PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTOR'S MODEL", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "HEWN; HIGH RELIEF; SCULPTURED", "Height": "22.5 cm", "Width": "17.5 cm", "Depth": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Royal bust", "Description": "This sculptor's model shows a royal bust in raised relief. The limestone backplate is very unusual; it is not rectangular but rather takes the shape of the nemes headdress. The latter is carved with many details: a headband, cloth with uraeus, and side and shoulder pieces. The rather puffy face and the fixed smile betray conventional Ptolemaic art. On the sides of the bust and on the back of the backplate are a series of lines in the form of squares."}
