Whilst the iconography on the exterior of the sherd and the lack of decoration on the interior of the sherd are consistent with the Wild Goat Style, it is possible that the sherd belongs to the same vase as two other sherds which are stylistically late for the Wild Goat Style and may mark a transtion to the Mature Animal Style.
