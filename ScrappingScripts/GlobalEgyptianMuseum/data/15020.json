{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 88053", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UPPER EGYPT", "Category": "HEADREST", "Material": "SYCAMORE", "Technique": "SCULPTURED", "Name": "Headrest with Two Deities", "Description": "\"Your head will not be taken away from you.\" So says Chapter 166 of the Book of the Dead. That is why the Ancient Egyptians placed a headrest under the head of the mummy to protect it from harm.This is a simple headrest made of sycamore, the local Egyptian wood. It has two rectangular bases and a crescent-shaped neck support. It differs from other headrests because of the two kneeling deities, who gracefully hold the curved neck support with their hands.In spite of the absence of any inscription, it is probable that the two deities are Isis and her sister Nephthys. These two goddesses played an important role in the funerary rituals according to Egyptian beliefs."}
