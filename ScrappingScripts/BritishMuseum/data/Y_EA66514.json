This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype A11-16, see especially A16 for this piece). This group varies in style with other animal representations on Naukratite scarabs and scaraboids - animals with more elongated bodies, finer incisions - giving the impression that they are of better workmanship (Gorton 1996, 122).
