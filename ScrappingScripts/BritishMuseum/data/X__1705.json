", " Probably made in Naukratis. Three similar examples of bearded figures from Naukratis, but with pointed caps (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA703; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4722 and in an earlier style, but of the same subject AN1886.486) with late 4th to 3rd century BC parallels (Memphis, Petrie 1909a, pl. 42, no. 55; Tell Atrib Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 174; Bayer Niemeier 1988, no.468).
