{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "24", "Dating": "MODERN PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SCULPTOR'S MODEL", "Material": "UNSPECIFIED ROCK", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; CARVED", "Height": "13 cm", "Width": "9 cm", "Depth": "8 cm", "Name": "Sculptor's model, royal head", "Description": "The piece consists of the face, head, neck and parts of the royal headcloth or Nemes. The back of the head was cut away behind the skull and hollowed out. The tip of the nose has broken off. The shape of the model is unusual. It is neither a bust with a flat back section nor a face with only the hint of a head-dress. The style of the face and the hair protruding from beneath the head-dress suggest a date in the 2nd or 1st century BC. However, several contradictory details, such as the stone used and the stylised rendering of the hair, are reasons for doubting the authenticity of this piece."}
