The deceased stands on the right with his hands raised in adoration before an altar of offerings. Behind it stand Ra-Horakhty and Isis. The texts above the figures name the prophet of Amun, Nht.f-Mwt, Ra-Horakhty, and Mut (sic). The scene is bordered by a 'was'-sceptre on each side. Below the scene are three lines of text which contain a prayer on behalf of the \u1ec9t-n\u1e6fr priest of Amun, Ikhonsushedef son of the fourth prophet of Amun, Nakhtefmut. Apart from slight cracks on the surface and slight damage along the edges, the stela is well preserved. The background of the stela is buff-white with a blue sky-sign at the top. The sun-disk is red with green uraei. Its upper wings are buff with black dots and a blue-green upper edge; while the lower wings are blue-green with feathers indicated in black and edged in red. The human figure has a red body with black features, a blue cap, green cone and collar, and blue-green kilt. The altar is blue-green with red and blue-green offerings. The god has a white face with black features, blue wig, red fillet, white crown, with blue-green feathers, green shoulder, red body, and green hands and sceptre.
