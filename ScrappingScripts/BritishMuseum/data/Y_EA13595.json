The body appears to have been wrapped when in an advanced state of decomposition: Skull - Upper incisors and canines missing. No obvious fractures. Body and Limbs - The ribs and spinal column are in a state of utter confusion. The humeri have been disarticulated and placed in positions to consolidate the the thorax. The disjointed radii and ulnae are so placed as to perform a similar function for the abdomen and pelvis. On the left side, as if to reinforce these 'splints', an inverted fibula lies externally. A similar state of affairs almost certainly exists on the opposite side, as both fibulae have been disected from the tibiae and are not present in the legs. The bone shadows on the right side, however, are very confused and accurate interpretation is difficult. No amulets. No lines of arrested growth. The body is wrapped in fine linen, with an encaustic mummy-portrait inserted into the bandages over the face, the front panel of the wrappings has been intricately arranged into concentric diamonds, each with a gilded stud at the centre, cartonnage foot section with polychrome painted decoration.
