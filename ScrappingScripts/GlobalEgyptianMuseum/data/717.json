{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.4930", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "EROTIC FIGURINE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL ?; PAINTED; FAYENCE", "Height": "5 cm", "Width": "4 cm", "Name": "Erotic harpist", "Description": "This figurine in blue faience represents a man seated on a small flat seat and playing the harp. Between the legs, one notices a disproportionate phallus and on the head two of two pieces in black colour. This latter iconographic element that one finds on a specific category of female figurines linked to the protection of the birth and of the newly born seems to be a relic of the skin of the lioness in which Harpocrates was wrappedd to assure total protection. The piece, which dates from the Ptolemaic Period, combines in this way the idea of protection, of eroticism and of fertility."}
