{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.5"], "Description": [" Terracotta reclining ithyphallic figure, probably Harpocrates. A naked child, modelled in the round, seated on a plain rectangular plinth and leaning on a tapering block, his legs extending to his left, the left one bent and flat on the ground, the right bent and raised up. He is a plump, feminine looking child, as is usual for Harpocrates figures. A large phallus emerges from between his legs and is held by his right hand. He supported his head on his hand. Solid; apparently made in a two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a thick grey core; the mica particles are small. Minute traces of pink paint remain, on the right arm and armpit, and between the phallus and the left leg. There appears to be signs of red paint on the plinth.
