{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1894:635.35", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "INTAGLIO", "Material": "STEATITE/SOAP STONE", "Technique": "CARVED; INCISED", "Width": "1.3 cm", "Name": "Plaque with the throne name of king Tuthmosis III", "Description": "Rectangular plaque inscribed on one side with the throne-name of Tuthmosis III in a cartouche between two cobras wearing the Double Crown, and on the other a sphinx wearing the Double Crown on the hieroglyph nb 'lord', with a cobra to the left of the crown, and the sun-disk above. The throne name of Tuthmosis III was Menkheperre. It continued to be used for at least eight hundred years after his death on scarab amulets, in part because it forms a cryptographic writing for the god Amun. The sphinx, cobra and sun-disc on the reverse can also be read as a cryptogram (hidden writing) of the name Amun. Amun means 'hidden one', referring to the idea of the creator as a universal but hidden presence, and a large proportion of New Kingdom and later scarabs hide writings of his name in this way."}
