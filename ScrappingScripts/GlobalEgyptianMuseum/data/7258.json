The child wore several necklaces as well as a bracelet of elephant hair on the right wrist and had several scarabs.  This piece of jewellery is composed of three disc-shaped carnelian beads (unique in the middle) separated by five to seven disc-shaped beads of bright blue or dark blue enamel. The two extremities are composed solely of enamel beads, most likely from Egypt given their colour and their quality. The carnelian came from desert pebbles."}
