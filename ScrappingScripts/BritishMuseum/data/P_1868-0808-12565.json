He wears a sabre and military boots, and, prophetically, an imperial crown. On each side is a helpless frog, one frog advances towards him with a dagger, clearly useless against the scaly giant. Others sit in terror, or skim through a gothic window. In the president's canopied seat sits a gaping spectacled frog (though the president was Lucien Bonaparte, to whom the 'coup' owed its success). Behind the general and on the extreme left crocodile soldiers with bayonets and pikes stand stiffly at attention.
