Most were arrow heads with a transversal cutting edge. In other words, the bevelled rectilinear side of the head was perpendicular to the shaft and assured contact and impact. The circular side, the back of the head, was directly fitted to the hard wooden shaft, which was set in the stalk of a reed. Occasionally, other heads were placed right under the main arrowhead, on either side of the shaft (cant parallel to the shaft, this time), thus creating a barbed arrow. These were fixed to the wood with a dark bronze-green adhesive. Approximately two thousand seven hundred segments of this type were found in the fortress of Mirgissa/Iken, where batches of two hundred to four hundred arrows were placed in stuccoed wooden boxes. Like a variety of tools and weapons, such arrow heads have been produced in Nubian since the Upper Palaeolithic. These, like other 13th Dynasty weapons found at Mirgissa/Iken, demonstrate that even at the end of the Middle Kingdom the Egyptians, who had known about bronze for a long time, still used stone weapons on a large scale and had mastered perfect cutting techniques."}
