Made of silver and decorated in a highly florid style with repouss\u00e9 technique, especially around the main body of the vessel where four ogee-topped panels contain figured scenes (possibly from the Ramayana epic) The top of the lid is decorated with a chinthe (mythical lion), while the spout where it joins the vessel, is decorated with a mask. The handle, in the form of an arching demon must have been separately cast, and is attached to the vessel using two ivory disks (one above and one below). The bottom of the vessel is decorated with a frieze of cast palmettes. The decoration has been finished all over with an engraving tool. The vessel is set on a plain, undecorated silver base.
