Simple Animal Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior. Given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) have very little decoration as well.
