The lower part of a figure, probably male, seemingly in rapid movement, on a low plain concave-faced plinth. He wears a long chiton, dragged above the right knee by his action; the end of a himation or chlamys hangs by his left side: part of the apparent folds of this drapery may be a left hand. Everything from above the upper thighs is lost; the back is plain, with the lower edge of a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a brown surface and a grey core. Traces of a white dressing.
