The central figure is dark and large, faces left, looks up and is bent at the knee. Immediately to the left are two smaller light brown figures parallel to one another, upright and facing right, the smaller of which is to the right of the larger. Above the dark central figure is an unidentified shape in light brown consisting of a long, straight line with an arrowhead-like shape at the top left. Below this is the head and left arm of a gesticulating figure in light brown, the remainder cut off the bottom of the image; to the right is the tip of one thick white cow\u2019s horn, cut off the edge of the image and pointing left. To the top right are the legs of a dark brown figure which, like the smaller light brown figure, is apparently wearing a skirt, cut off the edge of the image at the waist. The central dark figure wears what appears to be a white apron and is holding a long white object in its left hand. Karkur Talh, Egypt.

This site is about 100m from 2013.2034.1-4 and some 15m up the wadi slope; A shelter about 5m by 2m with a flat overhanging ceiling. Karkur Tahl is the largest wadi (dry seasonal riverbed valley) in the sandstone eastern section of Jebel Uweinat, a granite and sandstone massif on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" cattle ", " garment "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh ", " Topographic representation of: Egypt "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.16"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: EGYKTA0020012 (TARA number) "]}
