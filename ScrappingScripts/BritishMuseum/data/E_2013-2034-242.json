Karkur Talh is around 25 km long and lies mostly in Sudan, but partly within Egypt\u2019s borders. There is an abundance of both painted and engraved rock art in shelters in the smaller side wadis. The engravings were first revealed to academia by Ahmed Hassanein in 1923 and a few photographs published in his report on the journey in National Geographic in 1924. A more comprehensive publication of rock art sites in Karkur Talh was made by Prince Kemal el Dine with Abbe Breuil in 1925 following his discovery of a painted cave in Karkur Talh. Further exploration and publications were made by numerous others including renowned explorer Ralph Bagnold\u2019s expedition in 1931, with further exploration from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy and Leo Frobenius in 1933. The largest professional exploration of the massif to date was made in 1968 by a team of Belgian scientists."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" cattle ", " arms/armour ", " bird ", " engraved rock art "], "Associated places": [" Topographic representation of: Karkur Talh ", " Topographic representation of: Sudan "], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Trust for African Rock Art"], "Acquisition date": ["2013"], "Department": ["Africa, Oceania and the Americas"], "Registration number": ["2013,2034.242"], "Additional IDs": [" Previous owner/ex-collection number: SUDKTA0010027 (TARA number) "]}
