It is possible that wire or string was threaded through the two holes at the top to fix the plaque onto its place on the lid. Another example of a bookplate may be the calcite tablet now in Berlin, which may designate Akhenaten as the owner. Although it is generally agreed that this British Museum plaque is an \"ex-libris,\" there is considerable discussion as to the nature of the book referred to by the hieroglyphic inscription. Some authorities think that the title refers to a story of foreign origin, while others state that it was probably a native Egyptian tale, and still others believe that two trees are mentioned. One writer felt that the plaque might refer to a scientific book about the properties of the moringa tree and its products; he advanced a parallel suggestion for the Yale plaque, reading its inscription as \"book of the pomegranate tree. The contents of a chest containing papyri could be designated either by plaques like these or by pertinent decoration on the lid. Bibliography: W. C.
