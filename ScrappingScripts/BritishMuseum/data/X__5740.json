", " The scarab belongs to a type which was especially popular on Punic sites, less so in Greece and rarely in the Levant and in Egypt (Gorton 1996, 31-34, type XI, see especially no. 14 for this specimen). A relatively close parallel to the composition of this scarab was found in Tharros in Sardinia (H\u00f6lbl 1986, II, pl. 142/3 and 4; Gorton 1996, 32-33, no. 6). According to the few stratified examples, this type is attested in late 8th-early 7th century BC (Gorton 1996, 34). It could be one of these early scarabs discovered at Naukratis.
