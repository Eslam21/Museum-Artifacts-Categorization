{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Isis, or isis-Hathor. Probably a representation of \u2018Isis-Aphrodite anasyr(o)mene\u2019 (also known as Isis-Bubastis), who is commonly depicted holding up the front of her tunic to show her pubic area. This example is broken at the waist, the bottom half missing. Her hair is parted in the middle and Isis-locks fall onto her shoulders; she wears earrings (?) and an enormous wreath with decorative elements, from which leaves fall like wide ribbons from the headdress. From the top of the wreath rises a large flaring kalathos (broken and mostly lost), decorated with an Isis-Hathor crown of cow\u2019s horns and sun disc. The back is largely plain. A few traces of a white dressing are preserved (unless post depositional plaster). Hollow, made in a two-piece mould. Orange-brown Nile Delta silt fabric with abundant mica, quartz and some white inclusions.
