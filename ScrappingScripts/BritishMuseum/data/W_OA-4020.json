The Arabic for chick peas is himmas, now familiar in English as hoummous, which also occurs on vessel stamps. Both kinds of pulse were grown in Egypt from pre-Islamic times and they could hardly have been confused. Among the commentators on glass stamps Miles (1958, 269) was the first to identify julubb\u0101n or julb\u0101n correctly with the chickling vetch only to reject it as a reading on the stamps in favour of jullan\u0101r. He took the latter to mean the pomegranate; more precisely it means the wild pomegranate and particularly its flower, to which medical properties are ascribed in the pharmacopoeias. His reason for rejecting julubb\u0101n was that he doubted that 'this seed or blossom was sold by the druggists'. We would entirely agree, but are not particularly expecting to find drugs named on the vessel stamps. According to Miles julubb\u0101n and jullan\u0101r are identical in Kufic script. This is true except, in a proportion of cases, for the last letter. In the script of the commodity stamps r\u0101\u02be and final n\u016bn are very similar and at times indistinguishable; faced with an uncertain reading it is wise to try both possibilities. However, in many cases the final n\u016bn is curved back further than r\u0101\u02be and n\u016bn is often considerably larger, sometimes larger than any form of r\u0101\u02be. Examination of the stamps for this commodity reveals that n\u016bn is certainly the preferable reading on many of them. A final point requiring comment is the word muqashshar which is also found on vessel stamps describing lentils and peas (bisillah) (e.g. Balog, 1976, 840-1). There is no doubt that muqashshar, from the same root as qishr meaning bark, shell, rind or skin, refers to the removal of some kind of integument from the leguminous seeds involved, but it may be suggested that it does not here refer to the removal of the outer shell or pod as has been generally accepted.
