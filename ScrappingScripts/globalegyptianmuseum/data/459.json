{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3002", "Dating": "NAQADA", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "VASE", "Material": "POTTERY; POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED", "Height": "28.6 cm", "Width": "11.8 cm", "Name": "Red polished ceramic with figured decoration", "Description": "Red polished pottery from the Naqada Period often bears geometric decoration, while figured decoration is much rarer. It is found on the interior of shallow oval cups and on the exterior of narrow vases. The Brussels piece belongs to the latter category. Eight individuals, probably all male, make up just the one scene, which is difficult to understand. It could perhaps refer to a traditional scene of victory, in that four persons, necks tied together in pairs, are probably defeated enemies."}
