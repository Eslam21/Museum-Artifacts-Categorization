", " A number of examples were found at Naukratis, probably from the same mould series (Boston MFA 86.440; Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4698, AN1896-1908-E.4699; Brussels, Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire A.1841) or very close parallels (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA717). These were probably made in Naukratis and represent Harpocrates or his followers (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no.166). Close parallel from Late Ptolemaic context at Tell Atrib (Szyma\u0144ska 2005, no. 63) and Alexandria (Breccia 1934, no. 210). Parallels wearing this headdress have also been dated to the early Roman period (Fischer 1994, no.464; Dunand 1990, no. 287 see also 518). Breccia, E. 1934.
