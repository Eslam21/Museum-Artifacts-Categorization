{"artifact_name": "panel; naos", "Object Type": [" panel ", " naos "], "Museum number": ["EA67022"], "Description": [" A small section of the wooden panel from a naos: elaborately inlaid in mosaic and monochrome glass and gilded. The inlays described here, all monochrome, are in two blocks of plaster, apparently not in their original order. The larger group consists of the remains of a panel representing a flying falcon in dark-blue and light turquoise-blue glass. Some of the feathers are tipped with red. Scattered traces of gold-leaf. Also set into this plaster are two shaped pieces in dark-blue glass. The smaller group appears to be from the lower area of the panel, that section so frequently decorated with palace-fa\u00e7ade panelling. The uppermost register is a series of vertical rectangles in opaque dark-blue glass alternating with the aa-sign hieroglyph in light turquoise-blue glass. Below is a register of the nb-sign hieroglyph in dark-blue glass. In the lowest register are groups of three horizontal rectangles in opaque red and light turquoise-blue glass. All glass surfaces are filmed.
