The statues differ slightly from one another and bear the harmonious features of a young man with a serene expression. The most remarkable thing about these statues is the decoration on the sides of the thrones showing the theme of the unification of the Two Lands, which was associated with the Nile god, Hapy. On five of the statues, Hapy was replaced by Horus and Seth. Furthermore, we have here one of the rare cases in which the image of Seth, god of confusion, power and desert, was not destroyed through the superstition of later generations"}
