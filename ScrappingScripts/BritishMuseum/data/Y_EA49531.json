{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA49531"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta fragment of a naked woman, a beneficent demon, probably seated, her hands raised in blessing and protection (much of her arms are lost). She wears two choker necklaces and another necklace with a series of pendants; an armlet encircles her surviving upper left arm. Her hair is parted in the middle and arranged in parallel rows, the rear row coming down to hide most of her ears, which may or may not have earrings; longer locks fall to her shoulders behind the rows of hair. The figure is lost from the waist down and the back is missing. Two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt. Overall white dressing, somewhat worn away, with red paint on the hair and in traces on the body.
