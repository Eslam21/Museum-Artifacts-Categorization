{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.29"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Athena Dadouchos. Athene Dadouchos, standing, holding a large torch to her right side, and supporting an oval shield with her lowered left hand. She wears a medium-length girt chiton with overfall, and an aegis: the gorgoneion is very worn. Her hair is parted in the centre and is brushed back over her ears, and she has a crested helmet with chevron decoration on its face above the brim, with a raised circle on the front of the plume-holder; lappets fall onto her shoulders from below the helmet. The shield, which has a ring-shaped boss, rests on an object now incomplete, perhaps an altar: its lower part, together with Athene\u2019s feet and the plinth, are lost. The back is largely plain, only the helmet plume being indicated. A hole at the top of the torch has signs of burning, showing its use as an incense-holder. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with traces on the front of a white dressing.
