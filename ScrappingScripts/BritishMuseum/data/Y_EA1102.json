{"artifact_name": "temple-relief", "Object Type": ["temple-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1102"], "Description": [" Temple inscription usurped by Ramses II: a red granite temple relief, perhaps an architectural element, inscribed with a text containing the cartouche of Ramses II directly superimposed upon an earlier (by six centuries) inscription with the cartouche of the 12th Dynasty king Senusret III: 'Khakheperre'. Both are carved in sunk relief, but the later inscription is slightly larger and more crudely executed than the earlier. The red infill is modern. The right side of the block has been lost.
