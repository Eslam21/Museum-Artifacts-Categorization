It was found in the silver amulet case, or shrine (fig. 8), the sliding lid of which had been left slightly drawn and forced inwards, showing the toes of the figure. It is the most satisfactory to find it so, since not only is this little suspensory box a unique object, but it guarantees the genuineness of the image found within it, since the lid is stuck tight, and the side of the box had to be broken open to remove the figure. This was picked up by one of my workmen on the plain, and brought to me uninjured\"."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1888 / Tanis. Part II.
