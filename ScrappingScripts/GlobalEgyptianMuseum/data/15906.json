His eyes are inlaid.Greek influence is also evident, as can be seen in the royal head bandana, the locks of hair falling on the forehead, the sunken eyes, and the fine facial features. The nose is damaged. Using granite for the sculpture of the Greek-style pieces was rare, but the Ptolemies used it when they portrayed themselves as pharaohs."}
