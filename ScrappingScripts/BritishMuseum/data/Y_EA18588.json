He has a modelled face with traced eyes and a beard. His right arm is flexed across his chest and holds a stylized whip, ready to bring down on the backs of any reluctant workers. The short text on his apron identifies him as the 'sehedj', the Osiris-king Pinedjem, beloved of Amun.

He was high priest of Amun and army commander at Thebes in the early 21st Dynasty\u2014posts which gave him virtual control of the whole of southern Upper Egypt. During his rule he organized the transfer of many of the mummies of the New Kingdom pharaohs from their tombs to inconspicuous and easily-guarded caches, and it was in the largest of these, the \"Royal Cache\" at Deir el-Bahri, that he himself was ultimately buried. On the basis of his powerful position he adopted the titles and trappings of kingship on some of his monuments. This is particularly apparent on his burial equipment, where his name is written in a cartouche and he wears the royal uraeus serpent on his headdress. Pinedjem's shabtis are made of deep blue-glazed faience with details in black paint. They are divided into \"overseer\" and \"worker\" types.
