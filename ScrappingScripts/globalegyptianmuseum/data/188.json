He is wearing a skullcap and a short kilt. On the right eye we find several traces of black paint. The statue, characterised particularly by a certain heaviness which is created by the stiffness of the limbs and the disproportion of the hands (compare the statue of Sheikh el-Beled of the Museum of Cairo), dates from the Middle Kingdom and probably comes from one of the necropoleis of Middle Egypt."}
