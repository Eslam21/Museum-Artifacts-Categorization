{"Present location": "GRAECO-ROMAN MUSEUM [01/026] ALEXANDRIA GRM", "Inventory number": "JE 13353", "Dating": "BYZANTINE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "ALEXANDRIA", "Category": "UNSPECIFIED", "Material": "BONE", "Technique": "ENGRAVED", "Name": "Decorative Ornament of Bird and Roses", "Description": "The rectangular decorative ornament shows the side view of a bird, probably a sparrow. There are four flowers, three above and one below it. The ornament was made by notching. Its floral designs, made by sunken relief, include a branch with three closed roses, and an open rose in the center depicted above the bird. The bird's body was carved to a deeper level than the ground, or surface, of the ornament. The details of the body of the sparrow were engraved in low-relief, which means they were left at the same height as the ground. Although the surface area of the ornament is small, the artist paid attention to the details of the beak, the eye, and wings.A red color, now pale, was used in coloring the legs of the bird, the lower part of the wings, and the interior cuts of the closed roses"}
