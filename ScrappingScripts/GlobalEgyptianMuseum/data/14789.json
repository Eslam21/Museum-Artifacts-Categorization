The red color of the protruding eyeballs engenders fear of the cobra in the hearts of the enemy. The body is painted brown, red, blue, and yellow on a white background. The top of the head has an almost round, high projection, probably to receive a crown or similar headgear. The tail is coiled twice behind the erect body of the cobra. The statue is sculpted with few details, but shows the form in general. There are no inscriptions on the base specifying the name of the dedicator or that of the deity"}
