Two further cups with the same iconography and by the same painter are known from the Samian Heraion, see Thomsen, A., Die Wirkung der G\u00f6tter, Berlin and Boston 2011, 117, 121, figs 52-3, fig. 425, no. L13. The image of a 'great goddess' surrounded by winged beings is also found in 6th century BC Milesian Fikellura pottery (e.g. on an oinochoe from the sanctuary of Aphrodite Oikous in Miletus). Thomsen considers it possible that the plant the figure is holding might be silphion, but argues against identifying the figural type too precisely with a specific deity."], "Bibliographic references": [" Vase / Catalogue of Vases in the British Museum (B4) ", " Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
