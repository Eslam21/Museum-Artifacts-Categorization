{"artifact_name": "battle-axe", "Object Type": ["battle-axe"], "Museum number": ["EA36772"], "Description": [" Finely fashioned bronze axe-head: with almost evenly concave sides forming a relatively narrow waist mid-way between the butt and the cutting end. It has thin angular lugs and a convex cutting edge with pointed corners. The butt is inclined, giving the blade an asymmetrical shape, with one side (the upper when the blade was hafted) being longer than the other. The sides are faceted. Once covered by a rich patination, the blade has been cleaned since its acquisition. There is superficial pitting all over, most severely on the lugs. The cutting edge is frayed. Both faces bear the same lightly chased hieroglyphic inscription. Part of the prenomen on one face has been obliterated by corrosion damage, which has also, less severely, affected the other cartouches.
