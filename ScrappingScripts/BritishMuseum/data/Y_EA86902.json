{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86902"], "Description": [" Small fragment of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The rear shows a slightly convex surface, maybe from a leather bag. Two impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.3cm is impressed in the break. The upper side is roughly flat with the lateral sides bending downwards and showing many finger imprints. The half of an impression of an oval scarab-like seal is visible. Recognisable are two standing figures holding a staff between them. The left figure is preserved but very stylised, the figure on the right is only partly visible. The same motif is found on EA86911 and EA86915 and shows the heads preserved, probably Re-Harakhte and Amun. Both are positioned on top of a standing line. The style is very similar to the motif of EA86792, EA86793, EA86799, EA86800, EA86801, EA86802 and EA86812.
