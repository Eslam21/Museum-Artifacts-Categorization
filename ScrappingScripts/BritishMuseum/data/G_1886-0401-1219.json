In his catalogue, Schlotzhauer identifies the sherd as belonging to the South Ionian with everted rim Type 9B. However, in his chart of South Ionian cups, he identifies the sherd as belonging to a Type 9C cup. The curve of the shoulder and the curved junction of the rim and body suggest that the sherd might be better placed within his Type 9B group.
