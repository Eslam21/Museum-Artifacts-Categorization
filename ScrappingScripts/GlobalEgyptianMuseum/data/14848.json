The head, which is made out of beaten gold, was fixed to a copper statue of the falcon Horus. It is topped by a twin-plumed headdress and decorated with a royal uraeus, or cobra. The eyes are inlaid with rounded, polished, obsidian pieces, very similar to that of the real bird. It was certainly a cult statue, which was set up on a base in its shrine, with a royal statuette placed under its protection."}
