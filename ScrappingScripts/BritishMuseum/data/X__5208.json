", " Lemos interprets the exterior decoration as possibly part of a feline's legs. However, the feline would, in this case, be upside down and partly obscured by the underside of the phiale. The sherd is upside-down in her catalogue. Lemos also places this sherd in the Chalice Style. The whirligig pattern is found on a few Grand Style chalices. The interior decoration is unclear but is not a floral motif. Figurative motifs on the interior surface of Chian vases are found only in the Grand Style.
