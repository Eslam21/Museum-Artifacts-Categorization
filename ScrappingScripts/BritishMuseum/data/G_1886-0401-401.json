Very few Type 11 cups were found at Naukratis and Schlotzhauer suggests that these may have been made in specific workshops that rarely exported vases to Naukratis. The place of production of Type 11 South Ionian cups is determined as Miletus based on the results of NAA analysis carried out by Hans Mommsen, Bonn, on another sherd (British Museum 1886,0401.570) from Naukratis, though, even if the shape is similar, it has rather different decoration and is much more micaceous."], "Bibliographic references": [" Petrie 1886 / Naukratis.
