{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1904:537", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "DEIR EL-BAHARI", "Category": "FIGURED OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Name": "Drawing of Hathor on a limestone flake", "Description": "Drawing on a limestone flake showing Hathor as a cow in a papyrus boat. The fine quality of this drawing could only have been achieved by an experienced artist, who may have been the person who made the offering. This constrasts with the bulk of informal votive offerings to the goddess Hathor found by the Egypt Exploration Fund during the clearance of the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari. The majority of these offerings seem to have been deposited by women, and were probably intended to guarantee fertility and safe birth."}
