{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1814,0704.866"], "Description": [" Head of terracotta female figure. A head of a woman, broken from a figure. She has a melon-style coiffure, divided by a triple strip in the centre, and drawn back into heavy locks narrowing probably to a bun or a club, now lost, and may wear large ball-earrings: she is likely to be a high-ranking woman of the Julio-Claudian period or a little later. The broken edge has been smoothed in recent times to enable the head to stand. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown clay with a buff surface: probably an Egyptian fabric, but perhaps not.
