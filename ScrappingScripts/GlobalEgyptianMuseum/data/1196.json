{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.7075", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UPPER EGYPT ?", "Category": "ANIMAL/HYBRID FIGURINE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED", "Height": "20.5 cm", "Width": "6.9 cm", "Depth": "24.7 cm", "Name": "Nekhbet (?)", "Description": "This statuette of wood represents a vulture standing on a socle. The whole is painted in black; the details of the plumage and the head carry traces of the colour yellow. In view of the absence of any inscription, it is impossible to determine the exact identity of the divinity. It could be that this statue was a votive offering to Nekhbet, the vulture-goddess of Nekheb, the present town of Elkab, just like the two vultures on a wooden socle which the Belgian excavations of 1938 have discovered in the foundations south of the temple of the goddess."}
