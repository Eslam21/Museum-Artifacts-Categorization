This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This sacred musical instrument was particularly associated to the cult of Egyptian goddesses, notably Hathor, Isis, Bastet or Sekhmet (on sistra, see esp.: Hickmann 1949, p. 76-103, pl. XLV-LXX ; Pinch 1993, p. 143-146 ; Ziegler 1979, p. 31-62 ; Ziegler 1984). Naukratis provided several examples of sistra, in glazed composition like for this specimen, but also in copper alloy. Some of them can be dated to the 26th dynasty, supporting the practice of Egyptian cult activities in this period (Masson forthcoming; Yoyotte 1994-95, p. 674). This element can be compared to the sistrum from Naukratis BM 1885,1101.26 and other examples (such as: Ziegler 1979, p. 48, no. 45-47), though they present a characteristic papyrus stem on both sides of the Hathoric wig, feature that seems to lack on Liverpool fragmentary sistrum. This type is rarely well preserved \u2013 like here, only the head survived - which could pinpoint towards a rather fragile production (Ziegler 1979, p. 33). According to better preserved examples, it is a Naos-sistrum type. Based on comparison with well-dated close types, this series could belong to the Late Period (Ziegler 1979, p. 48).
