{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86696"], "Description": [" Comparatively small but complete seal-impression in a round shape, at the rear several impressions of a 0.37 cm thick string that consisted of turned fibres around a protruding central mud part. Therefore the sealing probably originates from closing a bag or similar item that was closed by a string. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of mica. The clay was hardened after excavation before it was cleaned properly. The front shows many finger impressions which also distort the oval scarab-like seal impression, leaving only a small area that is still recognizable. This part contains a circumferential band and a couple of hieroglyphs: maybe a nfr or Hr in front of a bird (maybe gm), behind it above a nb-sign, the rest is illegible. It looks like there might have been an earlier impression which then was covered by finger impressions and the new seal impression.
