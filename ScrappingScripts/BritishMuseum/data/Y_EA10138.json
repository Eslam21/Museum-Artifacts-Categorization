Provenance: this text was probably recycled for use in the Monastery of Apa Apollo, which was the destination of the tax demand written on the recto of this papyrus. Texts 1887,0514.9 and BM 10460 belong to a series of a dozen wine accounts and receipts from the Lansing Collection in the British Museum, most of which were issued by one Enoch who is given the title 'pistikos'. Four of them are written on the back of tax demands (BM 10460, 1887,0514.9, 1887,0514.4 , 1887,0514.10), two of which are complete enough to show that they were issued to monks of the Monastery of Apa Apollo to the south of Shmoun. The texts are written in two different hands, one of which is smaller and more cursive than the other. Like the present text, six of them are dated to the month of Phaophi (1887,0514.14; BM 10453, BM 10454, BM 10456,BM 10459, BM 10461). The amounts of wine are always given in 'cnidia' or 'kollatha'.
