", " The position in which Poseidon is depicted on the sherd is identical to the manner in which he is depicted on another cup by the Heidelberg Painter, from Delos. Brijder (1991, p. 380, p. 416, p. 427) attributes this sherd to the Heidelberg Painter's late period when the style of cups generally resembles those from his middle period but the painting is less exact and the drawing is usually sketchy. Poseidon's eyes, however, are depicted with great precision and the ivy leaf tips of his trident are, according to Brijder, an example of his care over small detail. Beazley places the sherd within his Subclass 2. "], "Bibliographic references": [" CVA Cambridge II / Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Great Britain, Fascicule 11, Cambridge, Fascicule 2 (p. 42, pl.
