Type 9C cups correspond to Attic Siana or Gordion cups and find parallels with Hayes' Ionian Cup Type X (Boardman and Hayes 1966, 111-6) and Vallet and Villard's Ionian Cup type B3 (Vallet and Villard, 1964, 87-8). The Type 9 shape evolved from the earlier Type 5 cup shape. Type 5 cups are rare at Naukratis whereas there are numerous examples of Type 9 cups. Both types were common drinking vessels found in Greeks sanctuaries, including the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Miletus. Unlike most South Ionian cups with everted rims, this sherd demonstrates that the cup was unusually large."], "Bibliographic references": [" Bernand 1970 / Le Delta \u00e9gyptien d'apr\u00e8s les textes grecs, i: les confins libyques (pl. 23.1.6) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GE.719) (Phase 1) ", " Schlotzhauer 2012 / Untersuchungen zur archaischen griechischen Keramik aus Naukratis (p. 52, no. 268; p. 109, Nau 66, pl.14c-d) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.244"], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 07 Oct 2011"]}
