", " The Hellenion is the most likely find spot based upon the excavation season, date and origin of this piece. The subject of Cypriot temple-boys, usually depicted with earrings and pointed caps with a long head-cloth falling down onto the neck, in this sculptural style had a long period of production on Cyprus. A close parallel in this late style has been dated to the second half of the fifth century BC (Beer 1994, pls 84.d, 86.b 87.e-g). 'Statuettes like this, of a crouching child, were regularly dedicated in Cypriot sanctuaries from about 450 BC into the Hellenistic period. Their meaning is not obvious, but they are commonly known as 'temple boys'. They are commonly depicted, as this one is, with a raised dress to reveal their private parts. These are rarely found outside of Cyprus. Most temple-boy statuettes come from sanctuary sites on the island of Cyprus, though a small number have been found elsewhere, for example at Carthage, in North Africa' (after Kiely 2012 entry for British Museum GR 1917,0701.125).
