This tile was found in the remains of the palace of Ramses III at Tell el-Yahudiya, along with other decorative tiles featuring cartouches of Ramesses III, foreign captives, rekhyt-birds on neb-baskets, and floral friezes of lotus flowers and grapes. William Flinders Petrie\u2019s excavations at Tell el Yahudiya uncovered additions to the town made by Ramses III, including a thick mud brick enclosure wall and a palace. The remains of the palace included a large red granite column base, calcite pavement blocks, and remnants of glazed tiles, as well as calcite decorative inlays featuring the cartouche of Ramses III and fragments depicting human and leonine elements (Petrie 1906, 8, 17, pl. 16A). Gaston Maspero commented on the palace at Tell el-Yahudiya: \u2018The core of the building is in limestone and alabaster; but instead of the usual sculpted panels, there is a sort of mosaic, made up in almost equal parts of cut stone and painted clay. The most commonly used feature is a roundel in friable fireclay coated with blue or gray glaze, against which simple rose forms, geometric frameworks, spider\u2019s webs or open flowers are picked out in shades of cream. The central core is in relief, with leaves and designs pressed into the mass of the clay. These roundels vary in diameter from one to ten centimetres, and were attached to the walls using a very fine cement\u2019 (Maspero 1887, 257-8; Ziegler 2002, no. 119, p. 436). The tiles were probably produced by moulding the roundel on both sides using pure, uncoloured sand-quartz siliceous paste, and then coloured paste added to the hollowed out area between the petals. Finally, a yellow boss would have been applied to the surface. There are 160 rosette tiles from Tell el-Yahudiya in the British Museum collection and another 56 are in the collection of the Louvre (Ziegler 2002, no. 119, p. 436).
