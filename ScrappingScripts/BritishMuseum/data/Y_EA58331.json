XXXVIII, no. 156 and 158). According to B. Jaeger, (Jaeger 1982, 204-205), convex rectangular plaques exist as early as the 18th dynasty, but became popular only under the Ramessid Period. Their terminus ad quem is problematic. They are clearly attested during the 21st dynasty, until Siamun's reign (986\u2013967 BC). However, several pieces of evidence, from Matmar cemetery (Brunton 1948, pl. LXII, 1, 5-6 - mainly 8th-7th century BC) and Naukratis itself, point towards an even later date. Composition representing three Bes-figures or associating a crocodile surmounted by two or more Bes are well attested on convex rectangular plaques of the Ramessid Period (Jaeger 1982, 229, \u00a7 1443-1444; Hornung and Staehelin 1976, no. 410). Jaeger suggests that Naukratis specimen should belong to this early period (Jaeger 1982, 205, \u00a7 1366, nn. 867-868). Brunton, G. 1948, Matmar, London.
