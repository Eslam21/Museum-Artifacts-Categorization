The man on the left places his arm around the other, but the man on the right does not return this gesture. The two figures wear the same simple kilt with a pleated section wrapped across the front to tie it. A dagger fits across each of their belts. Their wigs are the same color, but are different in style. The facial features of each man show clearly that these two figures depict two different people. The statue does not bear any inscription to help identify them or their relationship."}
