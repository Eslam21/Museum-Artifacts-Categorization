The representation of this deity is rather schematic, with green-coloured incisions on a pale yellow background. The face stands out in a slight relief; the lower part of the relief is suggestive of the mouth whereas the eyes and nose are indicated by a straight line that forms two triangles divided by a horizontal line. The headdress is surmounted by the suspension hole of the amulet. At the top, two vertical incisions go down the back of the piece."}
