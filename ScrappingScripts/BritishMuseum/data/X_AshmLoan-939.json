", " The sherd possibly belongs to the same vase as Oxford AN1896-1908-G.128.6. The amphora shape is not not common in Chian fine ware. The decorative motif finds a parallel in Oxford AN1912.37h. The fabric from Oxford AN1896-1908-G.128.6 was analysed by the Research Laboratory for Archaeology at Oxford. Using Ward's Method Cluster Analysis (WMCA), the fabric was found to have originated in the the southwestern or western region of the island, in the same area as pottery found at Emporio (Boardman 1986 287).
