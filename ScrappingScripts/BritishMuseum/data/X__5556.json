", " Scarabs with a lion motif depicted on the base belong to a standard group produced at the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Petrie illustrated a number of different versions (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 34-45 and 146 for this example). This lion displays an hellenizing style (elongated body and elegant shape). The scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in Sardinia, south Italy, Carthage, Perachora and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 127-128, type XXXV), though this piece is not listed. See BM 1886,0401.1694 for a lion depicted in a similar style.
