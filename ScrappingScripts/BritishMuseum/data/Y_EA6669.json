These areas are a half basket weave as the red weft is doubled and used as one (the single warps are undyed). They have grouped undyed wefts adjacent to them forming thicker self-bands- there are usually two of these but sometimes three. At the footend these thicker bands have the red wefts either side of them, which means that they don\u2019t just border or edge a red area. A small piece at the mid left leg appears to have a simple selvedge on one side and probably also on the other side, which would mean that the red areas were part of textiles which were woven as narrow strips.
