{"artifact_name": "architrave", "Object Type": ["architrave"], "Museum number": ["EA1278"], "Description": [" Limestone architrave of Washptah: the top is missing. The remaining four lines of text form part of a regular offering-formula containing Washptah's titles and dignities. On the left is a representation of the deceased, seated behind an offering-table piled with half-loaves of bread Above is shown another, smaller, offering-stand with jugs and a pot. The whole is carved in good, plain, sunk relief. There are various blemishes in the surface which, in antiquity, were made good with plaster, some of which has now fallen out, taking signs or parts of signs with it. Such a loss occurs after 'M\u0292\u2018t' in the last line; the second - of 'mrrw' later in the same line is carved on plaster.

Mariette, 'Les Mastabas de l'Ancien Empire' (Paris 1889), pp. 267 f. The principal stela with architrave above is published in drawings, op. cit., pp. 268-71; the text on the architrave corresponds precisely with such as is still preserved on this architrave, but it is reproduced running from left to right, whereas the text on this architrave runs from right to left. Furthermore, the measurements given by Mariette do not correspond with those of this architrave. Mariette gives the width of the false door as 1.84 m. and the architrave, as shown, must be wider, perhaps about 2.10 m. The measurement for the false door is confirmed by that given by M. Mogensen, 'Inscriptions hi\u00e9roglyphiques du Mus\u00e9e national de Copenhague' (Copenhagen, 1918) , p. 7, where 1.80 m. is given. This architrave is 1.72 m. wide and, although part of the right end is missing, the loss can hardly amount to nearly 40 cm. Yet it seems hard to believe that the two architraves are not one and the same piece. Between the time when Mariette copied it and its arrival in the British Museum, the architrave also lost its top line of text. Reference to Mogensen, op. cit., shows that the texts are reproduced in reverse order in Mariette, loc. cit. Bibliography. B. Porter & R.
