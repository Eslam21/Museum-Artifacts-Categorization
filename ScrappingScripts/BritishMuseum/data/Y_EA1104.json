{"artifact_name": "temple-relief", "Object Type": ["temple-relief"], "Museum number": ["EA1104"], "Description": [" Temple inscription of Ramses II: a fragmentary block of red granite. The hieroglyphic inscription in sunk relief (reading right to left) is arranged heraldically with the royal titulary of Ramses II, including two half cartouches and the title \u2018son of the sun-god Ra\u2019, inscribed above the names of his enemies. The foreign names are placed in rings, which may be a simplification of those shaped like fortified city walls used elsewhere, from which emerge torsos with distinctively foreign, pointed beards. These figures, which face in the same direction as the hieroglyphs, have their hands bound behind their backs and are tied together at the neck. The hieroglyphs which form the king\u2019s name are larger and more deeply carved than those used for the foreign enemies. The red pigment infill is modern. The surviving fragment is chipped on the right and left edges where more recent breaks have occurred.

The temple at Bubastis, where this block was found, was dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet. It dates back to at least the early Middle Kingdom and continued to be used for the rest of the pharaonic era. Most of the monuments found in the central court are attributed to Ramses II. The sunk relief on this block suggests it came from an external wall, since this type of relief carving is most characteristic of external walls. The careful ordering of the enemy names along geographical lines may represent the king\u2019s imposition of order over foreign lands. A comparison of the object with a photograph from the time of its discovery (Naville, 'Bubastis', pl. XVII) shows that another name-ring - Sngr - was preserved on the left of the existing fragment, and traces of another were visible on the right side as well as more of the royal cartouches. The crack on the left, along which the piece later shattered, can be clearly seen. There is no indication that the missing fragments ever reached the British Museum, and they were probably lost prior to transit from Bubastis. Bibliography: B. Porter & R.
