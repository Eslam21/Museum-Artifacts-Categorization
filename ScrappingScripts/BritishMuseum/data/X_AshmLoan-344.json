", " Beazley (ARV, 1423, no. 4) mentions a sherd from Naukratis which depicts a youth, as being from the hand of the Painter of Vienna 1089. However, he does not provide a registration number for the sherd. Given the similarities in profiles for the youth on this sherd and those of other youths attributed to the Painter of Vienna 1089 (for instance, see the bell krater 48.73 in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore), it is possible that Beazley was indeed referring to this sherd.
