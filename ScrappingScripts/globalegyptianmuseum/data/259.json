On the three sides of the votive momument the silhouette of the priest can be seen, the  head shaven and dressed in a garment to which the skin of a panther is attached. The lateral sides show Youyou in adoration in front of Osiris and Isis the Great; the rear side represents him seated before a table of offerings. The momument was erected by his son Wennefer, who fulfilled, amongst other functions, the role of first prophet of Isis. The two characters are known from other sources: the father is the owner of a naophore statue from the Louvre, of a stela from the Museum of Cairo and of a shabti from the Museum of Mariemont; the son Wennefer is mentioned on a statue from the Museum of Cairo and on two stelae preserved at the Louvre. Youyou lived under the reigns of Ramesses II and Merenptah. He was the fourth generation of a family of priests who played a role of the first order in the religious life of Abydos during the 19th Dynasty."}
