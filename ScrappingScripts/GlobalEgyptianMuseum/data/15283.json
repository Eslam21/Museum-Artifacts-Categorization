It shows three figures of the Lower Egyptian fertility gods in a procession. In their outstretched arms, they hold the sign of Hetep offerings and the \"Was\" scepter, symbol of dominion. Around their forearms hang several Ankh signs, symbols of life. Representing the Nile gods, they are bringing their offerings to the temple, under the starred vault of the heavens. It is noteworthy that the deities were shown with female bellies and breasts while the rest of the body is of a male. This is a sign of the fertility offered by the Nile to the soil of Egypt and of the role played by the Nile in unifying the two parts of the Egyptian land."}
