It joins fragments, recently re-discovered (1996,0101.1) of a fenestrated tripod-stand with a triple-moulded base, similar to the (apparently solid) stand British Museum 1888,0601.612.a-c. Published by Lamb 1932, pl. 1.3). Gardner 1888, 47, mentions grey wares as common finds in the sanctuary of Aphrodite, including \"tripods and other ornamental pieces, with relief ornamentation\". It therefore is likely that the fragment was found in the sanctuary of Aphrodite. Lamb 1932, 8-9, fig. 3.7, notes parallels for stands with plastic mouldings around the base (and/or top?) from Methymna on Lesbos."], "Bibliographic references": [" M\u00f6ller 2000 / Naukratis, Trade in Archaic Greece (p.259, no.5) ", " Lamb 1932 / Grey Wares from Lesbos (pl. 1, no. 3) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GL.164) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Acquisition date": ["1888"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1888,0601.645.a"]}
