The youth looks to his left and wears a side-lock extending from his otherwise shaven head; there is a bracelet on his left wrist. Solid; two-piece mould. Traces of a white coating, originally painted, but now lost. Nile Delta red-brown silt with grey core and abundant gold mica, organics, quartz and white inclusions.
