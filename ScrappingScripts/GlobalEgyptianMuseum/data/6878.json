The bottom is rounded and not really stable. The overall shape of this vessel is asymmetrical, as it has a squashed side. Throwing marks are still visible on the inside, especially at the bottom. The exterior surface treatment was applied horizontally with a comb (?). Of crude workmanship, this vessel was found inside an intact Kerma vessel and was part of a set of five vases."}
