{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1704"], "Description": [" Gilded terracotta figure of a draped girl dancing, from an imitation ear-ring. A small relief attachment in the form of a dancing woman, probably a kalathiskos-dancer, her thin chiton with overfall swirling around her. She moves to the right, but almost frontally, with her left arm stretched out (it is lost at the elbow), and her right arm bent with her cupped hand in front of her waist. The back is flat and plain, with finger-marks. Pressed into a one-piece mould, and the edges trimmed. White dressing on the front and considerable remains of gilding. Light red-brown clay with abundant mica inclusions. "], "Cultures/periods": ["Ptolemaic"], "Production date": ["3rdC BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Egypt (?)
