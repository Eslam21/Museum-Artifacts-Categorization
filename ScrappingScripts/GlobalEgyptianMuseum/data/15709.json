The coffin is made in the image of Isis. Her face is long. She wears an elaborately curled wig crowned by a wide floral headband. A large and colorful floral collar covers her entire chest and rosettes mark her breasts. Jewelry further enhances Isis's beauty. She wears earrings that are made of bone or ivory. She also has rings on her fingers and bracelets on her wrists. Isis is clothed with a long garment made of a single large piece of fringed linen. It was first wrapped around her torso, then draped over her shoulders and secured with a knot. In both hands, Isis clasps delicate tendrils of a creeper vine. This plant probably had a symbolic relationship with birth and rejuvenation.Hieroglyphic inscriptions are written around the box and the lid."}
