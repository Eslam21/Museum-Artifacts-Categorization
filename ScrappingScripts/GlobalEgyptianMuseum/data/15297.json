Punt was a locality near the Red Sea and the south of Egypt, now southern Sudan or Eritrea.The block shows Parehu, the Ruler of Punt, holding a rod. In front of him the Egyptians, guided by Pa-Nehsi, present jewelry and an exquisite golden dagger. Standing just behind Parehu is his wife, Ati, who is shown as a fat, deformed person. It is likely that the Egyptian artist showed her like this because she suffered from the disease known as elephantiasis, which is characterized by the enlargement of a part of the body. It is also likely that the artist exaggerated a little to make a sort of caricature, or comic imitation. The artist recorded all the details of African life. He even depicted small details such as the African collars worn by the Ruler of Punt and his wife and the strokes drawn on their faces."}
