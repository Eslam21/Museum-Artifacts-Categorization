{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA636"], "Description": [" Rectangular painted limestone stela of Renefseneb: with a polychrome border, and a raised band of stone framing the scene. Two rows of black monochrome hieroglyphs on a yellow background record the traditional prayer in Middle Egyptian. The final words are painted in a third line that encroaches on the scene. All the hieroglyphs face the same direction as the figures to which they refer: opposite Renefseneb are two relatives, a man and a woman who are named in painted hieroglyphs added above them.
