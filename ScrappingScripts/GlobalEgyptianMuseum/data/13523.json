{"Present location": "STATE HERMITAGE MUSEUM [10/002] PETERSBURG", "Inventory number": "4929", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "WOOD", "Technique": "SCULPTURED; PAINTED ON STUCCO", "Height": "24.5 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a porter", "Description": "The statuette represents a striding man with his left leg advanced. He wears a knee-long garment and a wig covering his ears. The body is painted red, the whites and the garment are white, the wig, eyelids and pupils are black. Since the arms that were originally pegged to the body are lost, the meaning of the statuette is not obvious. However, the absence of paint on the scapulae proves that the man was shown bearing a load, most probably a sack of grain, on his shoulders."}
