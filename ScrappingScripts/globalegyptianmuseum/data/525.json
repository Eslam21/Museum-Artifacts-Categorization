{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3406", "Dating": "GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD (not before); ROMAN PERIOD ?; ROMAN PERIOD (not after)", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "HUMAN FIGURINE", "Material": "PORPHYRY", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "7.5 cm", "Width": "5.7 cm", "Name": "Head of a man", "Description": "This tiny head of a man, once part of the \u00c9. de Meester de Ravestein collection, is carved in imperial porphyry. This stone is very rare in Egypt and comes from a deposit at Gebel Dokhan (Mons Porphyrites) in the Eastern Desert. Because systematic exploitation of porphyry did not occur before the second half of the 1st century AD, it is very probable that this Brussels piece dates to the Roman Period."}
