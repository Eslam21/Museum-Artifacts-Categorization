{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA51037"], "Description": [" Shallow, asymmetrical arsenical copper axe-head: with wide convex cutting edge and concave butt. The blade expands gradually from a rounded bottom end to reach maximum length at a point in its upper half about four-fifths along its width, from where it curves inwards acutely and narrows to form a sharp point. A raised rib runs centrally along its width from tip to tip. There are four binding-holes but no lugs. The cutting edge is thin but not especially sharp and there is no clear indication of wear. The blade has been cleaned of corrosion product. Both faces are superficially pitted and the cutting edge is eroded in parts. Surface damage along the butt indicates the line of the original haft.
