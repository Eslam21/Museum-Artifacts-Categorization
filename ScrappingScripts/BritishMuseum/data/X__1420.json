", " An Egyptian figure parallel from Naukratis (British Museum GR 1886,0401.1414; Higgins 1970, 406, no. C642, 1548 ), with a close mid 5th century BC Rhodian parallel (Higgins 1970, 269). However, an early Ptolemaic date cannot be excluded for this type as another example from Naukratis is dated by Bailey to the Ptolemaic period (Bailey 2008, no.3571; GR 1886,0401.1438). The long head, nose and ears are consistent with features found on Late Period and early Ptolemaic 'grotesque' examples from Memphis (Petrie 1909a, pl.44; Petrie 1909b, pl.33-4).
