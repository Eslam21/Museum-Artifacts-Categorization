He succeeded his father after having saved the throne from his father's murders and punished the conspirators but he is considered to have been the first of a series of increasingly weak rulers.Originally, he was buried in tomb KV 2 in the Valley of the Kings, but he was reburied in the tomb of Amenhotep the Second; his mummy was clumsily rewrapped and labeled by later priests. The king's eyes were replaced by artificial ones made of small onions, a unique case in mummification. In addition, each nostril was covered with the skin of an onion; it is possible that onions were used for their well-known antiseptic qualities."}
