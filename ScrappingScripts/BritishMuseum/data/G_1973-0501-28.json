A naked youth, modelled in the round and standing; the legs are broken away at the upper thigh. His head is shaven but for a large sidelock, and he holds a small bowl in his lowered right hand. His left hand holds his long and sinuous phallus, which rises to pass over his left shoulder and crosses his upper back, the glans resting in front of his right shoulder. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (early, ?) "], "Production date": ["400BC - 200BC"], "Production place": [" Made in: Naukratis (?)

The Louvre example comes from Naukratis, whilst the others were unprovenanced or have lost their provenance, but Naukratis is the most likely source for this objects, based on their style, fabric, date and collections history of these objects. Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC38349, see UC48390) and in limestone (late 6th to early 5th BC parallels from Sais, Daressy 1901, 230-239; see British Museum GR2011,5011.16) and faience parallels from Palaepaphos, Cyprus (Clerc 1988, 53-8, pl.16, Kouklia Museum no.86, dated \u2018Saite\u2019) and unprovenanced (British Museum EA1988,0229.1 EA71017). Probably late 4th to 3rd century BC, though some parallels are likely earlier. Bailey, D.M. 2008, Catalogue of Egyptian Terracottas in the British Museum, IV, London. Clerc, G. 1988.
