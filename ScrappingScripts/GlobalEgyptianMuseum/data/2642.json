{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1917:59", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM ?", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MASK", "Material": "GESSO; LINEN", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Width": "22 cm", "Name": "Mummy mask of painted cartonnage", "Description": "Cartonnage mummy-mask, brightly painted with blue and yellow striped wig, and a band of red and green rectangles between white-black-white blocks bordering the forehead. The latter detail occurs as the frame to Middle Kingdom stelae and coffins, and suggests an early date for this mask. The rough beard and simple cosmetic lines around the eyes are also consistent with a Middle Kingdom date, but such details may recur in archaising products of the Late Period and Ptolemaic Period, when cartonnage was again a common material for mummy-coverings."}
