This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " This scarab is published as coming from Naukratis (Budge 1893, no.101). The god Bes is an uncommon motif on the glazed composition scarabs of Naukratis, but is a very traditional and popular theme on Egyptian scarabs. Several Ramesside steatite scarabs and one plaque said to come from Naukratis depict Bes (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVIII, 149-150, 157; Gardner 1888, pl. XVIII, 74). The schematic representation of Bes can be found on several scarabs from the Third Intermediate Period cemetery at Matmar (Brunton 1948, pl. LXIII, 102-107). The finds at Matmar are mainly dated to the 8th-7th c. BC. This motif is not identified in Gorton's typology of the Naukratis Factory (Gorton 1996, 91-131) and the scarab is too large to be related to its production. The fine yellow paste is, however, reminiscent of many of products of the factory. Brunton, G. 1948, Matmar, London.
