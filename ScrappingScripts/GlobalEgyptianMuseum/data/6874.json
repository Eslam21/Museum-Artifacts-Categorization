Both surfaces were burnished, which has created, in the upper part of the interior surface (black) and on the exterior surface (red), a vertical rippled effect (hence \"rippled ware\"). The gloss, which is very well preserved on the outside, has disappeared on the inside. On the outside, the gloss, which is neater, was applied over a punctated \"dents de loup\" design (\"wolf's teeth\" motif) that is still visible in certain areas. It is likely that, with the burnishing, the design would have enhanced the rippled effect. The lip bears a further design of closely impressed diagonal lines."}
