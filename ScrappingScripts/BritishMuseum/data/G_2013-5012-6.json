The same box, however, provided an element from Kamiros (2013,5012.7). The motif displayed on the underside of this piece and the treatment of its back is unlike known scarabs and scaraboids from Naukratis. It is also larger than most glazed composition scarabs and scaraboids produced at the Scarab Factory (on its various productions, see Webb forthcoming). Therefore, its findspot should be considered with extreme caution. Webb, V. forthcoming, Faience finds from Naukratis and their implications for the chronology of the site, in R.
