{"artifact_name": "trial-piece", "Object Type": ["trial-piece"], "Museum number": ["EA23814"], "Description": [" Part of a limestone slab (four fragments re-joined), probably from a trial-piece, with regular grids of slighlty different scale incised on both of the flat faces (squares of 2,05 to 2,1 cm on one face, 1,77 cm on the other face). The incised lines of the grid of smaller scale show traces of red colour. One side of the object is preserved, showing a narrow border between the grid and the chamfered edges. The border is wider on the side of the grid of larger scale. EA 23815 (1887,0101.840) is probably a further fragment of the same item, but does not present any joint with it.
