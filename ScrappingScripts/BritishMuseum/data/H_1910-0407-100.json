The abbreviation stands for Colonia Nemauensis, the Latin name for Nimes, and the main device is the city's arms (these refer to the foundation of the original Roman colonia at Nimes by army veterans from Egypt). Compare Sabatier 1912, 361-2 and pls. 15-6, nos. 275-6, for examples in France, and a similar seal of an early eighteenth-century Nimes maker of silk stockings and cloth, David Baumer, was found in a wreck off eastern Mexico (Blair 1961, 161 fig.a and b, 178-9).
