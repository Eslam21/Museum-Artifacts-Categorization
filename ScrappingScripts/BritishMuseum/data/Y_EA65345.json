{"artifact_name": "mummy-portrait", "Object Type": ["mummy-portrait"], "Museum number": ["EA65345"], "Description": [" Portrait of a military officer in encaustic and tempera, probably on oak: the right panel is split by fissures. The right side and lower left corner are restored in plain wood. The background is painted sandy brown; the lower edge of the panel is unpainted. Traces of mastic survive at the left edge. Some of the painted surface is lost. Portrayed is a military officer dressed in a creamy tunic with an olive 'sagum' draped over his left shoulder and around the back of the neck. Beneath it is a red balteus ornamented with gold. The 'sagum' is pinned with a gold fibula. The subject has brown curly hair and a full moustache and beard, grown in the style of Lucius Verus (ruled jointly with Marcus Aurelius, ad 161-9). The bushy arched eyebrows give an air of surprise. The brown eyes are round and protruding, the nose very long and the lips full. The skin was originally painted in warm tones of brown, cream and red.

The subject wears the 'balteus' over his left shoulder, an unusual feature perhaps indicating elevated status, also suggested by the quality of the original portrait, which the original owner of the portrait, Theodor Graf, believed to represent Ptolemy Soter.
