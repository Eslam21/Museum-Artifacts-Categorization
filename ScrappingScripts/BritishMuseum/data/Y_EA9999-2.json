The text is written in hieratic, a handwritten adaptation of hieroglyphs for the medium of ink and brush on papyrus. The papyrus is divided into five sections. The first three sections describe the donations made by King Ramesses III (1184-1153 BC) to the gods and temples of Thebes, Memphis, and Heliopolis. The amounts were colossal: the list relating to Thebes alone includes 309,950 sacks of grain and large quantities of metals and semi-precious stones. Each of the three sections alternate with an illustration showing the king making offerings to the sacred families of Amun(-Ra), Ptah, and Ra(-Horakhty), the chief deities of these cult centres. In this frame we see the triad of Thebes: Amun, his wife Mut and their son Khonsu. The images are accompanied by hieroglyphic labels. The next section of the papyrus deals with a number of minor temples. The final section recounts the historical events of the reign and lists the possessions of all the great temples at the time of the king\u2019s death. The text presents the chaos at the beginning of the Twentieth Dynasty (about 1186-1069 BC) including military battles with the Sea Peoples, Libyans, and Meshwesh, and other foreign expeditions. This section is clearly idealised, glorifying the king rather than presenting a trustworthy historical narrative. Nonetheless, it does contain many important pointers to the history of the reign. The account ends with the death of Ramesses III and the accession of his son Ramesses IV (1153-1147 BC)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Grandet 1994 / Le Papyrus Harris I: BM 9999 ", " Trismegistos / An interdisciplinary portal of papyrological and epigraphic resources (381231) (http://www.trismegistos.org/text/381231) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Exhibition history": [" Exhibited: 1998/9 Oct-Jun, South Carolina, The Charleston Museum, Queens Commoners of the New Kingdom "], "Condition": ["Papyrus Survey: Condition Details: Papyrus: bleached, loss, delaminating, fractured, fragmentary, creased Black ink Pigment (cracked, loss) Supported locally: membrane Backed: white paper Mount Details: Sandwich: glass Binding: copydex self adhesive carpet tape (tacky) Binding: scotch magic tape Object Priority: B Mount Priority: C Overall Condition: C"], "Subjects": ["ancient egyptian deity"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription & portrayed: Ramses III ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Theban Triad ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Amun-Ra ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Mut ", " Named in inscription & portrayed: Khons "], "Associated places": [" Named in inscription: Thebes (historic - Upper Egypt) "], "Associated titles": ["Associated Title:", " Discourse to the Gods "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Miss Selima Harris"], "Previous owner": ["Previous owner/ex-collection: Anthony Charles Harris"], "Acquisition date": ["1872"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA9999,2"], "Registration number": ["1872,1101.1.2"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: Frame.2 "], "Conservation": ["Treatment: 10 Mar 1986"]}
