", " These leaf shaped, socketed and barbed types appear to originate in Anatolia and the Ionian cities of western Turkey. This example has good parallels from the mid-7th to 5th centuries BC (Baitinger 2001, figs 98-111, Zweifl\u00fcgelige T\u00fcllenpfeilspitzen type IIA2). Parallels from Tell Dafana and the nearby site of T21 that Oren identifies as \u2018Migdol\u2019 (Snodgrass 1964, 151, double edged with spur Form 3A2 dated to before c.600 to 460 BC; Erdmann 1973, 45 Form DIIc3, dated to 8th- 4th BC, or possibly longer date range; Oren 1984, 25, fig. 26.3 dated to late 7th to 6th centuries BC).
