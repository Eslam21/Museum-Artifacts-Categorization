{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA44"], "Description": [" Head and torso of granodiorite statue of Senusret I: depicting Senusret I striding bare-chested and wearing a royal headcloth and a kilt with narrow pleats. Enclosed in a cartouche and carved in large hieroglyphs, the king's prenomen decorates the centre of the wide belt holding his kilt in place. The thick body of the royal uraeus cobra, its hood now broken away, completes five turns as it winds over the top of the king's pleated headcloth. The wide back pillar covers the back of the headcloth and narrows at the top in the form of an obelisk. Due to damage, the form of the mouth can only be conjectured. A naturalistic mouth would complete the image aesthetically. However, the extremely wide rounded corners preserved at the sides of the mouth and the full shape of the lower lip suggest that the king's mouth was highly stylized with almost everted lips, significantly altering the apparent naturalism of his expression.
