Oo,10.200. The history of Berchem's drawing is not known but it probably was in France as the French collector and amateur etcher Claude Henri Watelet (1718-1785) made a print after it (BM impression, 1802,0712.25). As P. Stein observed, Huet's borrowing from a Berchem drawing was common among French artistic contemporaries such as Boucher. No painting by Huet derived from this drawing is known, but he etched it in reverse in his 'cahiers d'etude' of 1797/8 (BM impression, 1860,0211.163) and took a counterproof from it with the resulting drawing dated 1792 with Didier Aaron's London Gallery in 2004. Lit.: P. Stein, in exhib.cat., New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and London, BM, 'French Drawings from Clouet to Seurat', 2005, no. 63 (with previous literature). From a family of animal, flower and ornament painters, Huet first trained with animal painter Charles Dagomer (died before 1768) before joining the studio of Jean-Baptiste Le Prince. L. Hug's recent archival research on Huet has brought to light several inventories that reveal that he also assembled an extensive collection, especially of works on paper, and that the artists he collected in depth correlate with the artistic influences evident in his work.(n.1) Among the most prominent contemporary French artists represented in his collection were his master, Le Prince, and, in turn, his master, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, both of whom Huet apparently befriended, followed by Hubert Robert, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and Jean-Jacques Lagrene'e. Although a taste for Northern genre painting could have been gleaned indirectly through examples of Boucher's work, the inventory made after Huet's death enumerated substantial holdings of prints after Northern artists specializing in animals and rustic scenes, including Nicolas Berchem, Paulus Potter, Johann-Elias Ridinger and Philips Wouwerman. Although the emphatic and abbreviated handling of chalk in the BM sheet, as well as its Castiglionesque subject of rustic figures herding a flock of sheep by torchlight are strongly suggestive of Boucher's late pastorals, the compositional source has been identified as a pen and wash drawing by Nicolaes Berchem (1620-83), which entered the BM in 1824.(n.2) This work may well have been in France at the time Huet created his drawing as it was etched in reverse by the collector and amateur, Claude-Henri Watelet (1718-86).(n.3) Huet's use of Berchem's drawing finds ample precedent in the studio practice of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and others of his circle.(n.4) No painting related to Huet's composition is known to survive,(n.5) although he did return to the composition twice: once to rework the counterproof, a sheet which bears the date 1792, and once to etch it in reverse, with a printed date, Tan 6'.6 The procession by torchlight of rustic figures and sheep, travelling in the night with a woman and child riding a donkey is reminiscent of depictions of the Holy Family's Flight to Egypt. The breakdown of boundaries between rustic genre and scenes from the life of Christ is characteristic of the third quarter of the eighteenth century, especially in the work of Boucher and his circle.
