{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1913:241", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "ABYDOS", "Category": "VASE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED ON THE POTTER'S WHEEL", "Height": "14 cm", "Diameter": "12 cm", "Name": "Cypriot base-ring juglet", "Description": "Base-ring juglet of a type made in Cyprus and imported into Egypt in the 18th Dynasty on a large scale, presumably for the contents. No conclusive analyses of the contents of such juglets have yet been completed, although it has been suggested that the shape was intended to refer to the opium poppy seed capsule, inverted. Whatever the precise nature of the contents, it seems clear that it must be a Cypriot cosmetic or medicament highly valued in Egypt. This example comes from a rich, but anciently robbed vaulted tomb of the reign of Tuthmosis III at Abydos (see 1913:240 for the group: 1913:263 is another vase from the same shaft grave)."}
