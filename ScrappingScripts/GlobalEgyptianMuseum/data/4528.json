The larger than life-size seated statue depicts the wet-nurse Sat-Re holding the queen on her lap and breast-feeding her. Unfortunately only fragments of the statue have been recovered.By a unique coincidence a draft of the inscriptions for this statue has survived. The limestone sherd from the Habsburg Ambras Collection depicts five painted columns of hieroglyphs with the same text as on the statue: an offering formula with an appeal to both Queen Hatshepsut as a goddess and to Osiris asking for mercy for Sat-Re."}
