{"artifact_name": "ear-ring", "Object Type": ["ear-ring"], "Museum number": ["1899,1201.4-5"], "Description": [" Gold ball earrings: a closely matching pair of disc-and-ball earrings, with thick S-curved hooks terminating in a small knob. The ball element is a complete sphere and is very well made, without any visible trace of joins other than a small 'lid' at the top of each, through which the wire hook is attached. Each ball also has a small chevron-shaped cut in the back. The hook is soldered to the back of the disc element, which is 1.1 cm in diameter. Three small gold grains decorate the join of disc and ball. Earring (a) has suffered some damage, and the ball is slightly torn and crushed in places; (b) is in excellent condition and is very much heavier, presumably because it still contains a filling material of some kind.
