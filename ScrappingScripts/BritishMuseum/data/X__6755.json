", " Naukratis provided a wide range of vessels in calcite, chiefly alabastra. A few other shapes, often original such as this specimen, were also collected. Evidence for a local production of calcite vessels is given by the discovery of \u201cmany thousands of alabaster drill cores from tubular drilling\u201d as well as unfinished vessels in the same material found in the temenos of Apollo in 1885, between the temple and the north-west corner of the temenos (Petrie 1886, 15). Most of these vessels should be dated to the second half of the 6th or latest first half of the 5th century BC. Maybe this vessel was produced in this workshop. A second miniature jar in calcite, very similar in shape, was discovered in Naukratis: Montreal, Redpath Museum 2534. Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
