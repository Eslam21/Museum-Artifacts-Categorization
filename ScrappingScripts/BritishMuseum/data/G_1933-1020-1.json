{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1933,1020.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of crawling infant. A figure of a boy crouching on a low oval plinth: he is seated with his hands supporting his weight in front of him, and his head raised up. He has a side-lock and indications of hair above his brow, and is naked except for a bulla on his breast. His right hand and foot and part of the plinth are lost. It represents a child not yet able to walk and in the early stages of beginning to crawl. Solid and probably hand-modelled, but it may be from a two-piece mould. Micaceous red-brown Nile silt, with a darkgrey core.
