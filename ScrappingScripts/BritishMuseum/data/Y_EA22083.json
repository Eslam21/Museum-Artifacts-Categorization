XXXVII, no. 14). Only one attestation is known to Jaeger for a name of Menkheperra linked with the epithet \u201cLord of the Sed festival\u201d (Jaeger 1982, \u00a7 181). The style of the motif on the underside is reminiscent of the Phoenician style displayed in Gorton's type XV (Gorton 1996, 43-48). Hedgehog scaraboids are, however, not listed in the types of scaraboids known for this type (only round cones and African heads). For a good Phoenician parallel, see hedgehog scaraboid from Aschkelon: Oxford, Ashomolean Museum WAA 1889.578 (Keel 1997, 688-9, no. 2). The overall shape and style of the motif are very similar to the Naukratis specimen, but the central band on the back of the hedgehog is left blank.
