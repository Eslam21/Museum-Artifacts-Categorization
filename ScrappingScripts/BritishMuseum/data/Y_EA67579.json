{"artifact_name": "axe", "Object Type": ["axe"], "Museum number": ["EA67579"], "Description": [" Axe-head: with deep well-rounded blade and a straight butt elongated to form two angular lugs. The blade is slightly asymmetrical and the cutting end consequently lop-sided. It has been completely cleaned of corrosion product revealing surface imperfections which are largely the result of the process of manufacture. Most of the cutting edge has been affected by corrosion but one section is still quite sharp. It bears no obvious signs of wear. A distinct burr, caused by hammering, is present along one of the sides.
