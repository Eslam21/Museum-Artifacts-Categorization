{"artifact_name": "mosque-lamp", "Object Type": ["mosque-lamp"], "Museum number": ["G.4"], "Description": [" Lamp (mosque), made of blue, white painted and glazed pottery. The lamp has a slightly flattened bulbous body with three applied loop handles and a flaring trumpet neck, standing on a high foot with a moulded profile. It is painted in tones of cobalt blue with three bold indented chinoiserie trefoils filled with smaller trefoils, cloud bands and fine trails of foliage in reserve. Each handle is at the centre of a cloud band composition with knot motifs. The lower section of the body and neck bear undulating floral scrolls. Below the rim are three lobed oblong cartouches bearing inscriptions separated by knotted hastave on a finely dotted ground. The inscriptions are in na\u00efve, rather incorrect Naskh and read: All\uf07eh Muhammad, >Al\uf0a7, with BBW squashed into a corner; Nasr min, All\uf07eh wa fath qar\uf0a7b wa bi'ism; al Mu'min\uf0a7n ya Muhammad (part of Quran LXI, 13). There are cable and split-palmette arabesque bands at the foot, and a further cable band at the juncture of the body and the neck. The base has an elaborate knot design set within a ring of stiff lappets. Three metal suspension cables with pierced spherical beads probably of 19th century manufacture.
