{"artifact_name": "polycandelon(?)", "Object Type": ["polycandelon (?)"], "Museum number": ["EA66050"], "Description": [" Fragment of a gold-glass vessel: fragment from the rim and neck or upper body of a vessel of conical shape, in transparent colourless glass. The vessel was probably mould-blown with very thin walls and sheared rim. On the interior, a little below the rim, was a register of slender, vertical rectangles of gold-leaf at intervals of approximately 0.7 cm. Directly below this register was a narrow horizontal border of gold-leaf. Probably the lost lower body had additional decorations. Directly over these leaf decorations a layer of resin was applied, apparently as a protective coating. Where there are no gold-leaf decorations the resin layer shows through as a red-brown area. It is possible that this was a conical lamp to be inserted into a polycandelon.
