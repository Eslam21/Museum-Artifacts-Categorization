She is standing, holding a vessel tightly in her left hand crossed in front of her chest. Her left arm hangs by her side. The back is flat and roughly rendered, with an inscribed dedication to Aphrodite on the right side and incised turned 90 degrees: POLYERMOS MAN .. TE APHRODITEI.

", " Marked \u03a68 in pencil. Inscription: Poluermos m' an[etheke] te Aphroditei. This is the only female figure found in the Aphrodite-Temenos bearing an inscription The figure is associated with Yon's Type I B. The figure holds her offering - a bowl - in her left hand which is rather unusual but can be found in London B456 (Nick 2006, cat. 30) and Cairo 27429 (Nick 200, cat. 33). Holding the offering in the left hand according to Yon goes back to Egyptian models. Bowls are only carried by females in Cypriot iconography and two further examples from Naukratis carry a bowl, namely Cairo 27.610 (Nick 2006, cat.27) and Cambridge GR.2.1887 (Nick 206, cat. 26). The plastically rendered necklace places it into the context of Yon's type I B. Gardner 1888, p. 66, no 794; pl. XXI Nick 2006, cat. 32, p. 116; pp. 57-64 ", " Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
