{"artifact_name": "cosmetic-jar", "Object Type": ["cosmetic-jar"], "Museum number": ["EA5114"], "Description": [" A pottery cosmetic-jar: in the form of a woman playing a lute, with her body twisted slightly to the left. She wears a long dress, and a bangle on her right wrist. The object does not stand on its own, so would have been impractical as a vessel. After moulding, the face, fingers, and toes were enhanced with a tool. A red slip covers the surface, which is vertically burnished. Black paint was applied, as usual, to the hair and eyes, and to outline the fingers and the toenails. On the woman's tunic dress, the short sleeves, keyhole neckline with its little tie strings, the stitching of the side seams and the fringe of the hem are all indicated in black paint. The lute is also realistically detailed, from the tassels for fixing the two strings, to the frets, holes in the sound box, and plectrum. A checkerboard pattern on the back of the sound box represents the tortoiseshell of which such objects were made. The handle, spout and base were moulded separately and then applied. The potter has taken great care to obliterate all tooling marks.
