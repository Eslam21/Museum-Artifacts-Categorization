He wears a sun disk with uraeus between his horns, a collar around his neck and a patterned blanket over his back. Two outstretched winged shapes are incised on his body; over his shoulders it is a winged scarab, at the end of his back a vulture. The figure was solid cast by the lost wax process. It was donated by a man called Padiese son of Horenpe whose name is incised on the base with a prayer to the Apis.
