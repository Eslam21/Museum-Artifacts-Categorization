The front section of the sole still bears a knotted strap at 4 cm of the edge. This would have passed between the big toe and second toe and would have held the sole in place. The surface of the sole that was in contact with the foot is highly coloured, most probably because of perspiration and the reaction with the salts found in sweat. The leather is torn in several places."}
