Napoleon (left), very small and thin, holds him by the cravat and threatens him with a sabre, saying, \"All! - all! - you Jean F-t-e! - think yourself well off that I leave you Great Britain!!!\" Addington, terrified, says: \"Pray do not insist upon Malta! - I shall certainly be turned out! and I have got a great many Cousins and Uncles & Aunts, to provide for, yet!\" A French officer in uniform, (?) Andr\u00e9ossi, holds out his cocked hat to catch the papers which fall from Addington. He says, holding his nose: \"My General, you had better not get him turn'd out - for we shall not be able to humbug them any more.\" Napoleon wears a huge cocked hat with tricolour plume and a tricolour sash with immense spurs on his Hessian boots. 9 February 1803 Hand-coloured etching and aquatint "], "Producer name": [" Print made by: James Gillray ", " Published by: Hannah Humphrey "], "School/style": ["British"], "Production date": ["1803"], "Production place": [" Published in: London (England) "], "Materials": ["paper"], "Technique": [" etching ", " aquatint ", " hand-coloured "], "Dimensions": [" Height: 255 millimetres ", " Width: 357 millimetres "], "$Inscriptions": [" "], "Curator's comments": ["(Description and comment from M.Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VIII, 1947) England was determined to delay the evacuation of Malta on account of the failure to secure satisfactory guarantees, French annexations of Piedmont Parma, and Elba, and apprehensions that Napoleon contemplated a second conquest of Egypt.
