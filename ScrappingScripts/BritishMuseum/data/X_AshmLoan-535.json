This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Lemos identifies this sherd as belonging to the group of vases with floral decoration in the Chalice Style. The lotus flower and bud pattern found on these vessels appears on the exterior surface of the vases and in the later vases the pattern resembles that found on Fikellura vases. However, the same pattern also features on the cul of Wild Goat Style chalices, to which this sherd bears closer similarities. See Lemos no. 114 from Emporio. The sherd belongs to the same vessel as British Museum 1888,0601.468.k. Whilst the heavy chalice does not typically appear as early as in the Wild Goat Style, the thickness of this sherd suggests that it comes from a vessel much larger than a chalice. Perhaps this sherd marks a transition from the Wild Goat Style to the Mature Animal Style "], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
