{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["1917,0501.1136"], "Description": [" Silver snake finger-ring: this intact two-headed snake ring is an unusual type, with the heads almost meeting at the top. The scales are carefully engraved, with those on the upper part of the snakes' bodies small and overlapping, and those underneath broad and ribbed. The heads are particularly fierce in appearance, with the mouths opened to reveal a strip of metal forming the tongue. The beady eyes are placed beneath a heavy hood of skin, and are picked out with tiny cornelian stones.
