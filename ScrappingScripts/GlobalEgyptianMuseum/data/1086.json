The hair and base of an uraeus show that this royal person wore a nemes headdress, on top of which was probably the double crown of Upper Egpyt and Lower Egypt. Several iconographic elements are characteristic of the first reigns of the 19th Dynasty, in particular those of Sethos I and Ramesses II: for example, the elongated eye, extended by the use of cosmetic and with flat eyebrows, the aquiline nose, and the receding lower lip and chin."}
