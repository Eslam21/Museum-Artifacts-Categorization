{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA54678"], "Description": [" Fore-part of ivory sphinx holding figure of captive. The forepart of a sphinx holds in its claws the head of a prostrate captive, probably a Nubian, a traditional foe of Egypt. The sphinx wears the traditional royal nemes headdress, with the uraeus (cobra) at the front and the snake's tail extending across the headdress. The captive's knees are drawn up and his arms extended beneath the sphinx's legs. He appears to be naked except for a belt at the waist and a short wig. His back is arched, and his face is angled up at the sphinx, whose gaze rises above and over him. The sphinx's face is characterized by rather large eyes and ears and prominent cheekbones.

The sphinx\u2019s somewhat exaggerated facial features were originally thought to represent a foreign king, perhaps one of the Syro-Palestinian Hyksos who ruled Egypt in the Fifteenth Dynasty, and the sphinx used to be dated to the later Second Intermediate Period. More recent research, based on both stylistic considerations and an examination of the material discovered with the sphinx, suggests that it is from the Twelfth Dynasty, and might even represent Senwosret I. It seems likely that the object is substantially complete and was never intended as a free-standing three-dimensional piece; this is suggested by the two peg-holes underneath. It could have been a box handle or perhaps an ornament on a chair or some other item of furniture. It might have come from a royal context, since it displays the king's power over one of his traditional enemies. It might then have been given to a favoured official, who buried it in his own tomb as a mark of his status. There are a number of casts of this object, including one in the British Museum (EA 48999, registration no. 1909,0717.1), given to the BM by the Institute of Archaeology in Liverpool in 1909. Presumably the casts were made because its excavator, John Garstang, wished the existence of the sphinx to be widely known, but had already given the original object to Russell Rea, MP, one of his sponsors. There is an apparently identical object in the sale of the MacGregor Collection in 1922 (Lot 715, pl. XXI). It cannot be the BM example which was in the museum in 1920. Given that Liverpool were making copies of the original after it came to the UK in 1908-09, it seems most plausible to think that the example in the MacGregor sale was another such replica, given him perhaps by Garstang.
