The rim pattern is typical of the Wild Goat Style but the interior decoration is not consistent with that style. Rather, it belongs in the Mature Animal Style and Grand Style, as does the shape of the vessel. Black figure decoration is not typical of the Mature Animal Style but rather the contemporary Sphinx and Lion Style. For other vessels displaying a similar mixture of styles, see British Museum 1965,0930.305 and 1924,1201.208."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (GD.1557) (phase 2)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["1924,1201.335"]}
