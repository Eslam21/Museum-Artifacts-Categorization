", " Parallels from Kamirus, Rhodes, dated to the late 6th century BC (Higgins 1970, nos 68-74). Here are similar plastic vessel kore heads from Naukratis (GR1886, 0401.1400, 1421) also in similar micaceous orange fabric and dated to the late 6th century BC (Higgins 1954, no.61). There is a close parallel from Lindos, Rhodes, dated 525BC-400 BC (Blinkenberg 1931, pl. 85, no. 2115). It was originally thought to be made in Rhodes (Higgins 1954, 48-9), but is probably Milesian as Jones' NAA analysis of GR1888,0601.659 also from Naukratis, places it within his East Greek, probably Milesian group (Jones 1985, 673). Higgins cites parallels from Cumae, Selinus, Lindos, Ialysus and Thera (Maximova 1927, no. 68; Blinkenberg 1931, pl.95, no. 2117, see also pl. 96, no. 2129; Higgins 1954, 50). An East Greek kore flask parallel from Clazomenae is dated to the mid 6th century BC (Ersoy 2007, pl. 19.2) . A close parallel was found at the Turkish site of Erythrae and was dated to the end of the 6th century BC (Bayburtluo\u011flu 1977, pl.19, no.31). Bayburtluo\u011flu, C. 1977. Erythrai II. Ankara.
