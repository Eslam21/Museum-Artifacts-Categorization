Models of architecture comprise usually parts of architectural elements, such as half of the fa\u00e7ade of a temple, half of gateway and above all capitals of columns including the common Hathor naos-sistrum capitals, though complete columns and even a pylon of a temple are also listed (Tomoum 2005, 104). Such models have been sometimes associated with religious functions (connected to foundation rituals for example: Badawy 1972). N. Tomoun demonstrated that they were more intended \u2018to try out complicated combinations of different architectural details, an interpretation that works well at least in the case composite capitals (on the functions of these models: Tomoum 2005, 106-113). Such artefact could also be an unusual type of false door stela. Many examples are known from Saqqara. Several bear a Carian inscription (for example: Masson 1978, 29-30, 42-43, pl. VIII no. 2, pl. XX no.2, pl. XXII no. 1). Badawy, A. 1972, \u2018A Monumental Gateway for a Temple of King Sety I\u2019, Miscellanea Wilbouriana 1, 1-23.

", " The piece appears to combine both Greek/Anatolian (long rectangular door with two wings in rectangular recessed frame - cf. Roosevelt 2006) and Egyptian (subdivided door panels) features, similar to the 'hybrid' false door stela from Naukratis bearing a Greek funarary inscription (Cairo JE27753).
