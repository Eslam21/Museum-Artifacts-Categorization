British Museum 1888,0601.515 and 1888,0601.516 are separate in the BM register, but at some point were joined together with plaster fill and are shown as such in Price and Lemos. While they come from the same pot, they do not join. According to Williams, it may belong to the same vase as BM 1888,0601.502, 1888,0601.507 and 1888,0601.788. Williams argues that the image portrayed on the chalice was perhaps the representation of komos activities that took place in Chios. The buttock pads exaggerated the dancers\u2019 bottoms. The sakkos worn by many of these komasts as well as the earrings suggest the dancers, who were male, were practicing a form of transvestism. If so, these Chians dancers were precursors of the magodoi or performers who wore women\u2019s clothing, made lewd gestures and performed as female and drunk characters. The gestures of the dancers on the chalices are limited and consist of holding pomegranates, tambourines (or wreaths) and snapping fingers. Lemos describes this sherd as belonging to the Naukratis Painter. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures, however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. The thickness and size of the sherd suggest that the vase was a heavy chalice See also Boardman, J. \u2018Chian and Naukratite\u2019, Annual of the British School at Athens 51, 1956, 57, note 4."], "Bibliographic references": [" Lemos 1991 / Archaic Pottery of Chios.
