{"artifact_name": "statue", "Object Type": ["statue"], "Museum number": ["EA501"], "Description": [" Red quartzite mendicant statue of Paaha: The god Ptah - or more specifically, a cult statue of the god - is represented standing in a small naos, or shrine. Paaha is represented sitting cross-legged on the ground with his legs and feet covered by his long kilt. As was often the case with kneeling statues holding cult images, Ptah's shrine is balanced on one thigh, the proper left, and held by Paaha's corresponding left hand. Here, the sculptor has blundered by making the shrine so high that it impinges on his chin. The reason for doing this, apparently, was to support Paaha's raised hand. The gesture, hand to mouth with palm upward and thumb awkwardly forward, was one of begging offerings from the god. There is incised hieroglyphic text on the back-pillar and round the plinth.
