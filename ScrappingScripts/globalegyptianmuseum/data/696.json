Petrie in the western part of the enclosure of the temple of Ptah in Memphis.  It shows the representation of the well-known scene of the farao killing his enemies - here seen before the god Ptah - accompanied by the protocol and the cartouches of Tuthmosis IV. The function of this stela is not very clear: perhaps it is a miniature reproduction of the pylon of a temple decorated with the famous scene, thus serving as a cultic relief easily accesible to the people not allowed into the sacred places.
