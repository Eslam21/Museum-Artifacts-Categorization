The inner face shows a naked, front-on female divinity with hanging arms, wig and the hieroglyphic sign of her name over her head: this is the goddess of the west that welcomed the deceased into the necropolis. Two signs \"shen\" have been drawn under her feet to evoke the daily circuit of the sun, its renewal and resurrection. The outer face has some inscriptions narrating the offering formula. Mention is made of Osiris of Herakleopolis Magna, where this sarcophagus fragment must have come from."}
