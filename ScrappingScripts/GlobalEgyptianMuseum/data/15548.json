The queen's funerary bed was transported from her original hypogeum, or subterranean burial chamber, at Dahshur to another tomb east of the Great Pyramid at Giza by her son King Khufu to provide more security. The wooden frame of the bed is covered with thick gold leaves made up of two long sidebars with terminals in the shape of stylized papyrus plants. These sides are linked to one another by two wooden crosspieces. The bed rests on four gilded wooden supports in the form of lion's legs, which are attached to the frame with leather straps. The mattress base is supported by two long wooden beams that are fixed to the external frame of the bed. At the foot of the bed is a wooden panel, which is attached to the bottom crosspiece by wooden tenons inserted into copper holders."}
