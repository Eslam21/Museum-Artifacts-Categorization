His left leg is forward, in the tradition of Egyptian statuary. He wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and the short royal kilt called the Shendyt. His left arm is by his side, the right arm is bent, and he is holding the royal mace. The artist succeeded in carving the facial features and the ceremonial beard in this hard stone. Judging by its artistic style despite the bad state of its preservation, it is possible to attribute this statuette to King Nefer-ef-Ra of the Fifth Dynasty."}
