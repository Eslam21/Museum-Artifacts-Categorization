{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 62002", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "FAN", "Material": "GOLD; WOOD", "Technique": "CHASING; TURNED", "Name": "Ceremonial Fan of Tutankhamun", "Description": "This ceremonial fan of King Tutankhamun has a long handle made of beaten gold sheets around on a wooden core. It is topped by a stylized knob in the form of a papyrus flower and stem. Alternating black and white ostrich feathers were originally inserted in the gilded fan. Both sides of the palm of the fan are embossed and inscribed with the names of the god Aten and those of King Akhenaten. This suggests that the fan was originally designed at Tell el-Amarna and might have been given as a present to Tutankhamun."}
