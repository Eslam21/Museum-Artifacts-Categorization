The large wick-hole is at the rear of the deer's body; the square filling-hole is adjacent, with hinge-pieces for a lost lid. Round the deer's neck is a rope with a bell. Behind the neck is a small projecting bull's head, socketed to take a rectangular-section handle, now lost. On the left flank is a worn two-line inscription, possibly in Greek. The lamp is supported by three legs with cloven hooves, which emerge from the deer's back. The wick-hole is damaged; one leg is slightly bent.
