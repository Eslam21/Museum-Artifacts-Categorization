On the interior traces of black, dark red/brown, glaze with two pairs of added colour lines. The centre of the interior has a circle of added colour. The exterior also shows traces of glaze. The surface is chipped and worn, especially at the lip where there are almost no traces of paint. Soil residue and encrustations are adhered to portions of the surface. There is a crack in the vessel wall from the center to the lip. The overall proportioning of the bowl is a wide upper area and a more narrowed, but deepened bowl area, all standing on an even smaller base at the bottom.
