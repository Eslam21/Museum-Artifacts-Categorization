The seal is white, soft and probably made from gypsum or a gypsum lime plaster mix. It has been stamped with a circular stamp with a monogram, or possibly a depiction of an altar. There are inconclusive traces of two string marks, possibly used for removal. Traces of black sealant, probably pine pitch, are visible. There is damage around where its opening device, probably a string, was pulled.

This method of closing wine-amphorae with plaster stoppers was common in Egypt and North Africa during the Roman and Byzantine periods (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Unlike the mud stoppers (e.g., EA 53951\u201354) that were used on wine-amphorae produced by estates, this type of plaster stopper (e.g., EA 53955, 53957\u201363) was commonly used on wine-amphorae used by wine traders (Thomas 2011, types 1 & 7; Thomas and Tomber 2006: types 1 & 7). The traces of black sealant, probably pine pitch, suggest that the stopper belonged to a wine amphora (Thomas 2011, type 1; Thomas and Tomber 2006, type 1). Traces of a fermentation hole indicate that the wine must have been young and not finished fermenting when first transported. Cf., very similar monograms were found on plaster late Roman amphora stoppers from Clysma (Bruy\u00e8re 1966, pl. 27.7, fig 10.10). Bruy\u00e8re, B. 1966.
