", " This fitting can be associated to the sceptre Heka, kept in Bristol, City Art Gallery & Museum H2205.11. It shows similar manufacture characteristics. The flail Nekhekh and the sceptre Heka are both insignia of Osiris. Both belong likely to a figure of Osiris since Osiris bronzes were common in Naukratis (Masson forthcoming b). The Osirian cult is important in the saite nome, and particularly in Sais itself as stressed by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 445), but also on a more local scale (Masson 2015).
