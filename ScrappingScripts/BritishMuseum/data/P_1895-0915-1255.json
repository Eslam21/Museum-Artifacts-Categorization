The analogies are close, whether in the figure style, the rendering of drapery and foliage, or in the characteristic, diagonal and parallel shading. The attribution of the painting in Oxford is, however, based only on its proximity of style to other works by Drost, so that the reconstruction of his drawn oeuvre rests on somewhat insecure foundations. Nevertheless, the draughtsman who emerges from this group, including cat. nos.1-7, is distinctive, and the attribution to Drost widely accepted.[3] The composition may have taken its cue from Rembrandt's etching of the subject of 1645 (Bartsch 58, Hind 216), which is in the same, almost square format. Rembrandtesque in style, the drawing probably dates from around 1650, when Drost was still working in his master's studio.[4] A copy of the drawing is in the Kunstmuseum, Basel.[5] NOTES: [1] First proposed by Valentiner, 1934, and again in 1939, he was followed by Pont, 1960 and Sumowski, 1979 (see Lit. below). [2] Sumowski, 'Gem\u00e4lde', I, no.311, repr. p.620. [3] Benesch, however, never agreed with the attribution. Yet he used the present drawing as the starting-point for the definition of the artistic personality that is now associated with Drost. His ideas were based largely on those of Lugt, as recorded in Paris, 1933 (see Lit. below). [4] Sumowski suggests that a lost composition by Rembrandt may underlie copies formerly in Dresden and another sold by Delteil, 1909, no.111, and that this putative original may also have inspired the figure of Joseph seen here.
