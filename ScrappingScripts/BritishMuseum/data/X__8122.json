", " Dome-shaped weights, including sub-domed types, represent one of the most common weights found in Naukratis, and elsewhere in Egypt (Petrie 1886, Pl. XXIII, \u201csub-domed\u201d type; Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 3, fig. 13). They are often made out of igneous rock such as basalt and diorite \u2013 which is the case for this specimen. Already present in the Old Kingdom, this type is particularly common on Late Period sites in the Delta (Cour-Marty 1990, 25, fig. 26). Dome-shaped weights are more often associated to the Egyptian standard deben-kedet (usually around 90-95 g and 9-9,5 g for this type) and their multiples or sub-multiples. However a lighter unit, around 8g, is also noticed and could correspond to other standards such as the Near Eastern shekel or the Greek stater (Cour-Marty 1990, 24-25, fig. 22-24; Kroll 2003, 317; van Alfen 2002, 184, n. 654). This is probably the case of this specimen which could correspond more specifically to a sixth of a shekel (?). Cour-Marty, M.-A. 1989.
