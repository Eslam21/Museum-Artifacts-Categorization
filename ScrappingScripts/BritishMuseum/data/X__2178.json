{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta protome female head. The face is broad in comparison with its length, with a rounded chin. The brows project in a sharp and well-defined ridge, and the inner corners of the eyes, which curve more suddenly towards the nose, are sunk deeply into the face. The upper lip, which is very short, projects slightly beyond the lower one. The nose is straight from the bridge, where the prominence of the brows makes a slight break in the profile. The inclination of the forehead is not quite so marked as that of the nose. The hair is covered above the centre of the forehead by a narrow band, probably representing a metal cincture, and, appearing from beneath this, is drawn back above the temples so as to conceal the band by a thick wavy mass, which also hides the top part of the ears; these last are still further obscured by two large circular ornaments. There remain signs of the former existence of a stephane or tiara. The surface of the face and hair has been covered with a thick coating of friable white paint, over which details have been painted. Thus, traces of vermillion are visible at the corners of the eyes, and on the edge of the head-band, the lips, and the ear-ornaments; the pupils of the eyes, the edges of the lids, and possibly the eyebrows were marked by the use of a brownish colour. There are no signs of any colour on the ground white which apparently covered the hair, but the artist probably employed red. Hard red thick and coarse fabric, probably Nile silt.
