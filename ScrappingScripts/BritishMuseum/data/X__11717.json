If the reading is correct, this would designate this as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite, from the excavations in 1885-1886. This was registered with pieces labelled T, \u03a6, or TA\u03a6, followed by a context number, designating these as coming from a context within the sanctuary of Aphrodite. All figurines sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1911 to various museums appear to have come from Petrie's excavation of the Aphrodite sanctuary. This figure is highly likely to have been excavated within the temenos of the Aphrodite sanctuary."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DD.382) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Department": ["External"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: 27 (EEF distribution list number) ", " Miscellaneous number: 642.1 (Accession Number) "]}
