They are most commonly made of limestone with drilled pips, but were also made from faience, ivory, marble, pumice, metal and terracotta. Numerous examples were found at Naukratis (Thomas 2018). A lead parallel is known from Naukratis (World Museum, Liverpool, 9,9,86,119), and other examples are known from the Nile Delta in Egypt (1964,0107.81). Although lead dice are attested in Egypt, Thomas Burgon was also collecting objects from Italy, Greece and Turkey where dice are relatively commonly found in Hellenistic and Roman contexts. Cool, H.
