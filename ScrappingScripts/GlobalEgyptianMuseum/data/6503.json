The craftsmanship is rather fine, considering its size. The hair is pulled up in a chignon. Parted in the middle, it frames the face but is held back by a headband. The actual chignon was levelled out when the neck and the back of the head were recarved for repairs. A hole for a vertical tenon is pierced in the middle of the neck."}
