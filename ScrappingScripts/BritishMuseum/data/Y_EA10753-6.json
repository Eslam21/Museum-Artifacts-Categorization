{"artifact_name": "papyrus", "Object Type": ["papyrus"], "Museum number": ["EA10753,6"], "Title": ["Object: Papyrus Ramesseum E"], "Description": [" P. Ramesseum E, Frame 6. Papyrus written on the recto and on the verso in linear hieroglyphic script and hieratic (twelve fragments). The recto contains a funerary liturgy for ceremonies at a mastaba, while on the verso there is a (later) administrative text with remains of ruled lines, possibly recording distribution of grain. The text is written in vertical columns with titles in horizontal lines, in retrograde script. This frame contains lines 66-79. The papyrus was a half-height roll. The liturgy is fragmentary and obscure. 'Before [line] 66 we have already entered upon that part of the papyrus which most persuasively suggests a long funeral procession. Almost every [line] henceforward names some new person or body of persons whom we naturally think of as lined up to accompany the sarcophagus' (Gardiner, JEA 41, 14). In addition, 'the clearest testimony to our text's funerary character is the phrase \"Circulating round the mastaba four times\" in [line] 74' (Gardiner, JEA 41, 10). The verso text is a series of accounts (undated), mentioning granaries, perhaps a 'scatter of private holdings within a single estate' (Quirke, Administration, 190). The hand resembles that of the jottings on P. Ramesseum 3 (unpublished). The papyrus is part of the collection of papyri found with a bundle of pens in a chest from a plundered late 13th dynasty tomb under the Ramesseum, apparently belonging to someone like a lector priest. Two of the papyri from the chest are in the Egyptian Museum Berlin (P. Ramesseum A and D); the objects are in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge and the Manchester Museum. The papyri are very fragile, apparently due to dampness in the tomb-shaft. This papyrus was mounted on sheets of gelatin by Hugo Ibscher.
