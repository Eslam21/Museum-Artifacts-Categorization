The stela, topped by the cavetto cornice, is decorated with a scene of an intimate moment from the daily life of the royal family under the protection of Aten. A cavetto is a concave molding with a cross section that approximates a quarter circle. Facing each other, the royal couple is seated on stools covered with cushions. Between them stands their eldest daughter Meritaten, while the younger daughters are seen on their mother's lap. Akhenaten is portrayed with his characteristic features.
