", " Could represent an ithyphallic Harpocrates, Papposilenos or more likely an ithyphallic processional/ theophoros (cultist carrying a statue of a god). Found with two more complete examples of this type of figure (Leonard 1997, 287. no.1, pl. 7.1; 288. no.2, pl. 7.2). Ptolemaic and Roman examples (Bailey 2008, nos. 3151, 3152-43; Dunand 1990: 189 no. 512) range from 3rd/2nd century BC to 2nd/3rd century AD. Close parallel, possibly from the same mould series, found at Naukratis (Cambridge, Museum of Classical Archaeology NA481). Found in a mid 3rd to early 2nd century BC context (Leonard 1997, 288. no.2, pl. 7.2; see also 287. no.1, who suggests Papposilenos in a cultic setting). A similar scene appears on a plaque depicting an older, offering- bearer with a long phallus carrying a round pot (Schurmann 1989, 301-2, nos.1134, 1135, pl. 189). The elongated phallus, although distinctive, would certainly be at home among the worshipers of Isis- Aphrodite and Harpocrates, as well as in the numerous \"fertility\" scenes that are predominant in the Ptolemaic minor arts. The figure appears to cradle a jar against his side with his left hand, possibly bracing his left elbow on the architectural element below. This vessel does not appear to be a standard-shaped amphora (with its body tapering to a point) often carried against the left side by many characters in the Ptolemaic coroplastic repertoire, but a smaller, more ovoid vessel, perhaps with outsplayed rim. Possibilities for the object carried in the right hand include a phiale, as carried at the right side by an elderly, bearded man with his left hand on his hip (Birmingham Museum 1968, 18. no. 42, pI. 6).
