{"artifact_name": "finger-ring", "Object Type": ["finger-ring"], "Museum number": ["1917,0501.950"], "Description": [" Gold finger-ring. Made out of one piece of gold wire, tapering from the narrowest point at the tail to the broad and flat head. The scales of the snake are engraved simply, and rendered only on the upper part of the ring, where they could be seen. The broader scales on the top of the snake's head are skilfully composed, and their overhang at the sides gives the snake a menacing look from its almost hooded eyes. The snake's mouth, with its serrated edge, enhances this sinister appearance.
