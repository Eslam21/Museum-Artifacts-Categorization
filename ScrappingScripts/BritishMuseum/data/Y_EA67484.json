{"artifact_name": "battle-axe", "Object Type": ["battle-axe"], "Museum number": ["EA67484"], "Description": [" Bronze battle-axe-head: the three binding holes are well spaced and aligned and are relatively small. Two cylindrical ferrules are corroded, in their original position, on to the ends of the butt. The capped, upper ferrule is split down the rear and at the top, and the lower ferrule is similarly damaged just beyond the lug. Both the axe and the ferrules are thickly corroded. The ferrules bear the clear impression of the original binding, the width of these marks indicating that the thong in each case was wound around the ferrule several times, and the line of the haft is preserved along the butt of the axe. Unusually, the butt appears to have been slightly bevelled. "], "Cultures/periods": [" First Intermediate (?) ", " Middle Kingdom (?)
