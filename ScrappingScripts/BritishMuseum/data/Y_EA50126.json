Asiatic\u2019 looking male figurines date to between the mid 7th and the late 6th century BC, with very close parallels from Cyprus, probably from the Arsos workshops (Karageorghis 1995, 19-21, Type I(ii)38, pl. 9.3). V. Karageorghis argues the \u2018Assyrian\u2019 look may coincide with Assyrian domination of Cyprus during the 7th century BC (Karageorghis 1995, 21). Four other similar pieces were found in the temple of Aphrodite in Naukratis (GR1949,0808.1, GR1949,0808.2; GR1949,0808.3; AES1911,0710.102) with other Cypriot pieces (AES1911,0710.92-106; Bailey 2008, 186) marked \u201cT \u0391\u03a616\u201d or \u201cT \u0391\u03a617\u201d (Temple of Aphrodite, Findspot 16 or 17) from a 26th Dynasty context.
