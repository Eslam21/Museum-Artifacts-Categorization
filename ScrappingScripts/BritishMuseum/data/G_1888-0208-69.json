GB 583.2-4. His left foot is misdrawn across the right foreleg of the horse. The animal below on A is a goat to judge by the tip of the horn; for the treatment of the shoulder compare the deer of two amphorae related to Clazomenian (BSA xlvii, 134-5-D.3 and 4). The groups of fragments forming A and B do not join and it is not certain they are from the same pot, though they are thought to be. The riders are probably male, or more precisely there is no positive reason to suppose them female. This was perceived long ago by R. Zahn (Darstellung der Barbaren, 61 n. 2) and most recently emphasized by F. Brommer (Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale d'Arch\u00e9ologie d'Alexandrie xxxiii, 287-92). But the contrary view still recurs (e.g. C. T. Seltman, Cornhill 1950, no. 982, 300-1, where an ill-considered conclusion is drawn: The same error was made in BSA xxxiv, 40 n. 3), and so it is as well to set out the evidence here. White is fairly often used in Clazomenian for the flesh of youths - for the bird-fancier of Pl. GB 588.5 and for the riders of Pls 589.19 and 591.1 and of Alexandria 24052 (Brommer, op. cit., fig. 2); and the mature Achilles, Hector, herald, and king are white too on the sherds Brussels M.831 and Athens 5610 (AM xxiii, pl. 6; E. Pfuhl, Malerei und Zeichnung iii, figs. 146-7). So there is no reason why the other white riders, the archer of Pl. GB 584.3, and even the hoplite and archer of Plate GB 588.8, should not be male also. As for the 'bust' of the rider on A, the male chest is often distorted on Clazomenian pots. Especially close to this youth are the bearded man of Pl. GB 587.11 and the dark rider of Pl. GB 588.6; the undeniably male figures of Pls. GB 583.2-4, 584.2 (it seems), 585.1-2 and 3-4 show a general similarity, though the arm is forward; and the comasts and satyrs of Pl. GB 592. 1-2 and 3 add a surprisingly developed nipple. Nor is this kind of distortion peculiar to Clazomenian, since it can be found even in Attic. The subject is perhaps derived from the last ride of Troilus, as Zahn believed (AM xxiii, 50-51). If so, it has lost its significance and become a decorative design to be used on front and back of the pot. Of the other Clazomenian instances of lone youths riding only two have any suggestion of a pursuer: on Pl. GB 591.1 there is a hoplite behind, but the horse is not galloping; on Berlin Inv. 453 IAb (AD ii, pl. 56. 3) the horse is galloping and what may be two fingers of a dark figure come after it. But riders are anyhow common in East Greek art of the middle and second half of the sixth century, so that the Petrie painter and his fellows had no need to look far for inspiration. For the trappings of the horse, which are of Oriental - and perhaps specifically Assyrian - style, and for the type of horse see J. D. Beazley, Lewes House Collection, 22-24.
