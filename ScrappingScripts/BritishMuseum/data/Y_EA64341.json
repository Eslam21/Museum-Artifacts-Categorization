{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA64341"], "Description": [" Statuette of a ba-bird: a statuette in opaque red glass, matt surface, of a ba-bird standing on a base. The composition is entirely traditional with the bird standing frontal and wearing a short headdress. Cross-hatching on wings and tail. The details of the face and striations of the wig were added after moulding. Relatively crude work but a rare type in glass. A large gap on the back where the two wings meet is a moulding defect.
