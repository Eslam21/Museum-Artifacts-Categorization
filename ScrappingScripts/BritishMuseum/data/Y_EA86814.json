The rear shows a semi-circular convex surface, maybe from a leather bag. Two deep impressions of a turned cord with a width of 0.25 cm is impressed in the rear. The upper side is flat at the top and bends downwards to the sides. At the flat part a complete oval scarab-like seal-impression is preserved with few finger impressions around it. Visible is a fine circumferential line and a decorative pattern of small spirals running outwards. Above and below a small nfr-sign in the middle and circles at the outside. Part of the same sealing can be found on EA86807.
