The scarab belongs to a type which was widely distributed in Sardinia, south Italy, Carthage, Perachora and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 127-128, type XXXV, subtype 1-7, see especially 6 for this piece). Cerveteri and Tarento provide good parallels to this motif (H\u00f6lbl 1979, pl. 74, 3a, no.111 and pl. 137, 1a, no. 1171).
