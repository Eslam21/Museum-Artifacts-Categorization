Petrie illustrated a number of different versions on scarabs and scaraboids (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, 4-7). This scaraboid is close to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 98-99, type XXVIII A, A169 for this piece). However, since the motif on the base is engraved and not stamped, it does not share the technical characteristics as defined in Gorton's type XXVIII.
