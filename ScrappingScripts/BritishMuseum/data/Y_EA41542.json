{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA41541"], "Description": [" Ostracon with the 'Instruction of Amennakht': limestone ostracon painted with twelve lines of hieratic. This copy is well written on a carefully chosen ostracon and the scribe's handwriting seems modelled on Amennakht's own. It was certainly an exercise, since the date is written in red under the final line, as was a common practice of apprentices. The red points mark the ends of lines of verse; in 11. 9-10 a mistake has been made, and there is one point too many (similar mistakes occurs in 11.5 and 6).

His apprentice Hormin was the son of his colleague Hori and friend of his own son Amenhotep. The Teaching was probably circulated locally among the litterateurs of the village, as well as being used as a copying exercise for Amennakht's apprentices. Some seven copies on ostraca are known, but all the others contain a shorter extract than this one. Bibliography: G.
