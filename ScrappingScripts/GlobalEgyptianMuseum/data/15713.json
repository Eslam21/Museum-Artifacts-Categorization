{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 28717", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "GOVERNORATE OF LUXOR", "Category": "KOHL POT", "Material": "BRONZE; WOOD", "Technique": "WOOD-TECHNIQUE; CASTING", "Height": "18 cm", "Name": "Kohl Pot with an Unusual Figure", "Description": "This pot for kohl, an eye paint used to enhance beauty and protect the eyes, is composed of an unusual figure standing with his arms by his sides and his hands flat on his body. He wears a headdress like that worn by the people of Asia Minor and Upper Syria and, thus, he could represent an Asiatic. The face is disproportionately elongated; the eyes are large; the mouth is narrow; the cheeks are flat; and the chin is wide. He is wearing an ankle-length kilt that is tight at the hips. Traces of red and black colors reveal what once was a collar. To the front of the man are two containers: one for the kohl and the other for the stick. The container to the right of the man has a very narrow hole containing a bronze kohl stick. To the left is the kohl pot, which is closed by a small removable wooden stopper. Grey kohl mixed with sand was found inside the container."}
