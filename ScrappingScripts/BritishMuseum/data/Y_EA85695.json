{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA85695"], "Description": [" Fragment of an ostracon from a pottery vessel, showing two lines of hieratic text written in black ink. The sherd is part of the handle and the body, with the lower part of the handle remaining. There is a black horizontal line at the base of the handle. The text seems to be turned by 180\u00b0 in relation to the orientation of the vessel, meaning that the text was added after the breakage of the vessel. The vessel is made of Nile clay, with a whitish self-slip and belonged originally to an amphora.
