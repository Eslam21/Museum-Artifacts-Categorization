This flower was intimately linked with the theme of creation. Its image, opening itself during the day and closing itself for the night, evoked the solar cycle of the sun, which rises from the Primordial Ocean only to hide itself again after its daily journey. In the city of Hermopolis Magna the lotus had a special significance for religious cosmogony, which taught that from the Primordial Ocean a lotus flower arose, out of which the solar child emerged to create light, humans and gods.
