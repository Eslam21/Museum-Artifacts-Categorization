", " Many votive boxes for snakes were discovered in Naukratis. According to Petrie, the cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city provided fifteen of this category of votive boxes (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885 several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Votive boxes of this type were particularly associated with the solar god and demiurge Atum (Weiss 2012, 278). This specific type of snake votive box, with a coiled snake figure, belongs to the type T 14 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 727-731, Pl. 42d-e, Typ T 14, esp. Nr. 750-754, 758-762, 764-767 from Naukratis). The naomorphous (\u2018altar\u2019 or \u2018small shrine\u2019-shaped) box is rare within the Naukratis corpus (on this shape, see Ikram 2005: 335).
