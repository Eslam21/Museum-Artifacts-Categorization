The handle itself has been given the shape of a papyrus plant. The shapely, curving umbel and the stem have been made as separate pieces and joined together. The stem has fine lengthwise ribbing and three bands across the transition to the umbel. At the bottom the stem is covered by leaves. Some remnants of the original linen covering of the mirror are still attached to it. The corroding metal has left a negative imprint of the cloth on parts of the mirror's surface."}
