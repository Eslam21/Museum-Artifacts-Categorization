", " Edgar explained that \u201cone of the trenches at the South end of the site produced a great quantity of small faience objects of the Saitic period\u201d (Edgar 1905, 134). This trench was done \"just N. of the \u2018Great Wall\u2019\" of the Great Temenos and have provided figurines of Egyptian deities, pendants and beads (Hogarth diary \u2013 2nd of May 1903; on this context: Masson forthcoming). This amulet might come from such a context. Sow amulets are associated to ideas of fecundity and to the sky-goddess Nut. They start to be popular with the Third Intermediate Period, though they were already produced in the Late New Kingdom: (Herrmann et al. 2010, no. 4) and are common during the Late Period (Andrews 1994, 35, fig. 32; Germond 2005, no. 6-7; Herrmann et al. 2010, 94). Sow amulets from Naukratis present usually a very schematic design, like this example.
