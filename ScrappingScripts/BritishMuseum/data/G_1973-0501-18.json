Modelled in the round. He is naked, with a pointed head (wearing a hat?), with prominent buttocks; his lowered hands grip his phallus. Hand-modelled. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a red and dark-grey core and a partially drab surface. The flesh is painted red, surviving in several places; whether the drab spot indicating his right eye is intentional is uncertain.

A similar hand-made ithyphallic Harpocrates figure was found in a 5th century BC Persian period deposit at the bottom of a well (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum AN1896-1908-E.4653It; Hogarth 1905, 125; Hogarth 1903 Diary April 24th and 25th, well 2 bottom). Parallels from Memphis (Petrie Museum, UC48351, see also similar UC49892-3, but uncertain subject). The upper body fragments are identical to contemporary hand-made Persian rider figures from Naukratis and fragments can be hard to distinguish (see British Museum, 1886,0401.1468)."], "Bibliographic references": [" Terracotta / Catalogue of Terracottas in the British Museum (3254) ", " Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (DC.079) (Phase 1) "], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["Much of the support on which he sits and most of his legs are lost, and the root only of his huge phallus survives.
