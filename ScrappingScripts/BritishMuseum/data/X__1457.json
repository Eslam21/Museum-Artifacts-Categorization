{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure of Bes. Bes standing on the capital block of a column, naked, with his hands on his thighs; he wears a feathered headdress. Column bulging out into a round object. The capital widens upwards and is undecorated, probably based on a papyrus capital. The back is plain and the crown is pierced at the top, perhaps to hold a stick of incense. Hollow, from a two-piece mould, with traces of a white dressing on the column and orange paint on Bes' left leg. Red-brown Nile silt fabric.
