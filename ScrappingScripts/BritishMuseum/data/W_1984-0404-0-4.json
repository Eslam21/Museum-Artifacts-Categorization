This may have formed part of a chain pendant originally attached to a necklace or diadem with multiple chains, of which examples are attested from the Near East and Mediterranean from the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods. In Southern Arabia loop-in-loop chains were also used in the manufacture of armlets, judging by an example depicted on the statue of Maadil Salhan, a 1st century BC King of Awsan. Loop-in-loop chainwork was first developed in the Near East during the 3rd millennium BC, was used on diadems, pendants and earrings. Examples of this early period have been excavated in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Crete and the Greek island of Lemnos, where they were occasionally found in precious metalwork hoards or in royal tombs. The techniques relies on casting the component links in tiny moulds in order to obtain pieces of uniform size, and then pinching, folding and threading the links to create highly tactile, fluid and virtually indestructible chains.
