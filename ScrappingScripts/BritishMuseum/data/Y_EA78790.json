The weave is plain and weft-face. The spinning direction of warp and weft is 's'. The thread count of the first fragment is warp 17 per10mm and weft 13 per10mm. The second fragment is with a thread count warp 13 per10mm and wef 12 per10mm. The fabric is undyed wool which was identified by microscopic observation, varying from ivory to light tan. Yarn thickness varies from medium to coarse and is never overspun. There are stitch holes for a hem or seam in each fragment. Stitching thread (?) appears to hold together a seam to one side of the first and third fragment. Felted surface of first and second fragment can be observed.
