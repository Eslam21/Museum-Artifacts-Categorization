", " \u2018Of small glass objects, \u2026. and the dark blue glass head (31) bearing a similar face on each side\u2019 (Petrie 1886, 43). ", " The blue glass pendant with a female face on each side was recorded by Petrie as coming from the town (Petrie 1886, 43). Parallels either have a suspension loop for use as a pendant (British Museum 1856,1223.1691), or a metal shaft inserted into the bottom to create a hair pin (Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna, 2011, 301). While Haevernick (1968, 648) dates the group strictly to the 4th century BC, excavated examples from Acanthus (Greece) (Trakosopoulou 2002, 80, fig. 4), Alexandria (Breccia 1912, 101, no. 318, fig. 64), and Hagoshrim (Israel) (Yeivin 1966) suggest that they are produced c.330\u2013200 BC. Widely distributed across North Africa, Spain, Italy, Sardinia, the Levant and the Black Sea coast, these are commonly associated with Punic manufacture on the basis of a concentration in the Punic sphere. In consequence, the female figure has been identified as Tanit, whilst the bearded males have been identified as Baal-Hammon and Eshmun-Melquart (Carreras Rossell 2003, 23; Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011, 301) or Silenus (Trakosopoulou 2002, 81). However, the distinctive layered wig resembles the diagnostic Isis locks found on Isis-Hathor figures of the Ptolemaic period; the bearded male could then be taken to represent Serapis. Irrespective of production place, this example may have been interpreted by the wearer as one of a range of deities.
