It lacks the hoe, mattock and basket (standard attributes of Late Period shabtis) and instead of the shabti spell (Book of the Dead chapter 6) is inscribed with an offering formula. This, together with the absence of hands and the inclusion of a pedestal, suggests that the figure should be classified with Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statues. As such, it would be a very rare example of this type of figure in stone."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Condition": ["fair"], "Associated names": [" Named in inscription: Psamtek ", " Named in inscription: Osiris "], "Associated places": [" Named in inscription: Qift "], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Giovanni Anastasi"], "Acquisition date": ["1839"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA8891"], "Registration number": ["1839,0921.730"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.8891 (Birch Slip Number) "]}
