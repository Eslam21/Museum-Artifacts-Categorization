{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1986,1006.8"], "Description": [" Terracotta woman celebrant beating a tambour. A woman celebrant stands on a plain flat-faced plinth, beating a tambour with her right hand. Her chiton reaches to mid-calf and she wears an overgarment almost as long; a himation hangs down her right side. Her hair is parted in the centre and falls in Isis-locks in front of her shoulders; she has a large tightly woven and bound wreath and ball earrings. She may have a garland round her neck, or it may be the fringe of one of her garments. By her right foot is a round-bottomed pot with a rounded rim. The back is plain with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt; traces of pink paint on the wreath.
