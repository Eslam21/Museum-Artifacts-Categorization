{"artifact_name": "textile", "Object Type": ["textile"], "Museum number": ["EA77810"], "Description": [" Seven irregularly-shaped fragments of a dark brown, blue, natural, red-brown and red wool textile. The yarns are 's'-spun and 's'-plied. Four of the seven fragments show no woven features. One fragment (85.2.45.2) was mended in antiquity. Another fragment (85.2.45.3) has a reinforced selvedge and a band of red and natural coloured wefts bordered on each side by a 10mm wide blue band. Blue yarn is present in the selvedge and suggests the presence of 2 additional blue bands now missing. A third fragment (85.2.45.6) has an area of blue wefts with traces of embroidery in natural and brown colour. A small dark brown, wool tassel is attached to it. A cloth fragment (85.2.45.7) was sewn to 85.2.45.6 and contains the remains of a band of blue, natural and brown wefts. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Christian Period (?) ", " Post-Christian (?)
