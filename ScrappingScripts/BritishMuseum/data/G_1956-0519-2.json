{"artifact_name": "papyrus-sealing; seal-impression", "Object Type": [" papyrus-sealing ", " seal-impression "], "Museum number": ["1956,0519.2"], "Description": [" Clay sealing from a papyrus. The images are well preserved and show a strong portrait of a male ruler with fleshy jowls and a large hooked nose, a type associated with Ptolemies VIII and X. The second head shows a similar, although less exaggerated, portrait of a female ruler. There is a ghost of a third female head, which may have been where the seal slipped or may actually represent a third head, in which case the triad can be identified as Ptolemy VIII, Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III. The exaggerated portrait of the male is, however, closer to the images of Ptolemy X. On the back are impressions of horizontal lines, from where the sealing was originally attached to a papyrus document.
