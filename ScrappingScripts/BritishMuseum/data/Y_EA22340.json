{"artifact_name": "pilgrim flask", "Object Type": ["pilgrim flask"], "Museum number": ["EA22340"], "Description": [" A pink pottery pottery flask of circular shape with a biconvex body, decorated on each side with concentric grooves. A narrow neck is inserted at the top and is flanked at its base by two small handles, one at either side. These handles are degenerate versions and non-functional. The top of the neck is finished with a projecting rim. As usual for this type of vessel, the flask was made in two halves, which were then joined around the perimeter. There are a few traces on an external red slip.
