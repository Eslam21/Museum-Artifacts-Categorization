{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 38607", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "KARNAK", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "GREYWACKE", "Technique": "CARVED", "Height": "40 cm", "Name": "Unusual Block Statue of Montuemhat", "Description": "Montuemhat is depicted in a squatting pose with some unusual variations. Aside from the almost free-standing figure of Osiris positioned on a pedestal between his legs, he appears to be undressed. This apparent nakedness contradicts the style inherent in this type of statue, making it unique. The goddesses Nephthys and Isis are engraved on the left and right sides of the statue, flanked by single columns of inscriptions. Montuemhat wears a wide, smooth double wig covering the upper halves of his ears. His head is slightly tilted upwards with his beard descending to his chest. The idealized face is exceptionally well sculpted. The mouth is straight and thin-lipped; the nose is very thin and moderately aquiline; the eyes are wide, almond-shaped and slanted with rounded eyebrows. This statue is an example of the creativity of individual Egyptian sculptors, who were constrained by conventional poses, but were able to create innovative adaptations."}
