The long tripartite wig is rendered solely by the contours and the volume, but the separate locks of hair are not indicated. Only the position of the hands, which can be distinguished with effort, indicate that the arms are crossed on the chest.  The deeply incised hieroglyphs are noted on eight horizontal lines and in two short vertical columns. They still retain traces of blue-green paint. The separating lines are painted in red. The text is taken from Chapter 6 of the Book of the Dead."}
