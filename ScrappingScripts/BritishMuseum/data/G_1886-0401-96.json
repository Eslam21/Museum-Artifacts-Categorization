He classified these cups as his Type X, which he recorded from his Level 250 in the sanctuary of Apollo (Petrie 1886, 20, pl. XLIV); he dated this level to the earlier part of the sixth century BC. The cup has been analysed with NAA by H. Mommsen (Bonn) (see Schlotzhauer and Villing 2006: 55, Table 1; Sample NAUK 51). Analysis of the fabric placed it in Group EMEB with a place of production in the region of the Knidian peninsula and recent excavations in the Sanctuary of Apollo at Emecik on the Knidian peninsula have also produced several examples of these types of cups (Attula 2005, 144, pl. 78, 297-9). According to Kinch's typology of vases from Vroulia, this cup belongs to group a of his Yellow and Brown Cups (Kinch 1914, 24-5). According to Hayes, this cup belongs in Group VI i of his Rhodian cups (Boardman and Hayes 1966 112-3); several examples were found at Tocra, and because they were commonly found at Kameiros in Rhodes, Hayes suggested their place of manufacture to be in the area and thus refers to them as Rhodian cups. He dated them cups between 580-540BC but Schlotzhauer prefers to see an earlier date (circa 610-580BC) because of the decorative parallels between these cups and South Ionian cups with everted rims datable to that period.
