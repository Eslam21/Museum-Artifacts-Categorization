{"artifact_name": "amphora", "Object Type": ["amphora"], "Museum number": ["EA23776"], "Description": [" Neck from an amphora of pale brown pottery with a pale cream slip on the interior and exterior. The fabric contains many inclusions of white limestone chips, flint and other bits of grit. It has a tendency to laminate, possible as a consequence of salt action, with the result that the object is cracked in numerous places. At each side of the neck is a scar marking where a handle has been broken away. The handle fragment 1887,0101.870 which, according to the register, joined this neck is not present. A red-painted motif (now very faint) is on the exterior. There is also an incised mark, which appears to be a rough attempt to write the excavator's findspot number 19.
