Cowroids are relatively rare in the corpus of scaraboids from Naukratis. Such shape was produced locally in the 'Scarab Factory' (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming), since several examples of cowroids of the same type were discovered at the site (Petrie 1886, pl. XXXVII, no. 52). Though the hieroglyphic signs on its base could have just some magical value, it seems plausible that this is a cryptographic inscription. The formula 'Amun/Amun-Ra is my lord' can be written in many different ways (Drioton 1957, 20-26). Drioton, E. 1957, 'Trigrammes d'Amon', Festschrift Hermann Junker zum 80.
