{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3380", "Dating": "NAQADA II", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "MULTIPLE VASE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; PAINTED", "Height": "8.5 cm", "Name": "Decorated ceramic", "Description": "Beginning in the middle of the Naqada II Period, the Egyptians used fossil marl clay for the manufacture of decorated pottery. This clay comes from the deserts and makes objects made from it much more solid. The pottery is distinguished by violet-black decoration on a rose-yellow base and by the introduction of new designs: the principal subjects are rowing boars, women with raised arms (identical with figures in the round such as Brussels E.3006), animals, and plants. They are placed in a landscape in which water and the mountains play a significant role. On this double vessel rowing boats on the Nile can be seen, the water being indicated by undulating lines."}
