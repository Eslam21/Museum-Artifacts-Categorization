This headdress is decorated with the royal cobra, or uraeus, for the king's protection. The king is wearing a collar, formed of many lines of beads made of semiprecious stones and gold. This bust was probably the upper part of a statue representing the king in the pose of Osiris, god of the afterlife. He is wrapped in a shroud like a mummy and his arms are crossed. The right hand holds the Heka, the crook-like scepter of sovereignty, while the left hand holds the Nekhekh, the flail of dignity."}
