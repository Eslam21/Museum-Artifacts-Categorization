{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA1341"], "Description": [" White limestone false-door of Qar: at the top there is a plain cavetto-cornice and the inscribed area is surrounded by a plain forus-moulding. There are three vertical panels on each side of the doorway. The lintel bears a simple \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula, and the six vertical panels carry Qar's titles and dignities; his titles also occur on the small, subsidiary lintel. These texts are carved in sunk relief of moderate quality. At the bottom of each vertical panel there is a standing figure of Qar who is shown in various attitudes of authority; these figures are carved in sunk relief of a peculiarly gauche nature. The rectangular panel above the doorway has a representation of Qar seated behind an offering-table, carved in fair, low relief. Above the table is incised a short \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw text. The surface in general is sound apart from that of the rectangular panel carved in low relief; some flaking can be detected here. No colour remains.
