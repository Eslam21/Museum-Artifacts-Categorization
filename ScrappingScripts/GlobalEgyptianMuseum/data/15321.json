Each one of them is standing on a round base with anklets on their legs. As this is a child's toy, a system of strings threaded through holes and around a pulley makes the figures dance. Depicted with a certain degree of realism, the bodies are shown deformed, the legs are bowed, and the faces express exertion. They are wearing different types of necklaces."}
