Several sanctuary lamps were found in the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Gardner 1888, 48; British Museum GR 1888,0601.151.a-c; 1888,0601.151.d-e; 1888, 0601.151.f; 1888,0601.151.g), or were subsequently attributed to the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Bailey 1977, previously unregistered in the British Museum GR 1965,0930.884-885; GR 1965,0930.882; 1965,0930.883; 1965, 0930.881; 1965,0930.880; 1965,0930.877; 1965,0930.878; 1965,0930.879; 1965,0930.888; 1965,0930.889-891; 1965,0930.892; 1965,0930.886; 1965, 0930.887).
