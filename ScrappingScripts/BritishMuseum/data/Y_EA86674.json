{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86674"], "Description": [" Fragment of a clay seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration. The fragment is showing two rows of basketry coil impression at the rear and at the side one further row, meaning that this piece was positioned most likely on the lid of a basket. The fine brown Nile clay has inclusions of small mica particles. The top part shows two impressions of a scarab-like seal, partly overlapping each other at the edge, and few finger prints around the seal impressions. The seal impression are quite shallow and depict probably a bird in the middle, facing to the left, in front of it two hieroglyphs (maybe nfr or nTr) on top of two small and flat signs like Gardiner N19. Behind the bird maybe an uraeus. Quite similar to EA86673 but the cutting of the seal seems much sharper and better defined. The clay was hardened after excavation. Exactly the same seal impressions can be seen on EA86675.
