Below  two udjat-eyes and the shen-ring, five horizontal lines of hieroglyphs, executed in a rather mediocre fashion, occupy the upper part of the monument. The text consists of a simple offering formula in favour of a certain Renseneb. This person and his father are represented in the lower register, opposite one another and seperated by a table of offerings."}
