    "For documentation of IM.Metal.25/South Kensington Museum\n          no.1069/India Museum nos.68 and 17, see 1880.3687.b. For\n          fragments of a similar ear-ring, see 1880.3717.h-i. C.\n          Fabr\u00c3\u00a8gues: Three-bead ear-rings have a long history. They appear\n          during the Late Ptolemaic period (1st century BC) and continued\n          in use until the 14th century (Zimmer 1991). The earliest\n          ear-rings of this type have the spaces between the beads filled\n          with fine coiled wire, and a hook and loop for fastening, as can\n          be seen on an example found in Egypt (Egyptian Museum, Cairo\n          no.28498; Zimmer 1991, p.40). Two Egyptian mummy portraits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one\n          dated AD 50 and the other AD 200 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also depict such ear-rings\n          (Parlasca 1972, no.247, fig.1; no.323, fig.2), while two\n          1st-century silver examples (probably both gilded) were found at\n          Thebes (GR 1905,1020.1-2; Marshall 1911, pl.LIII, nos.2565,\n          2567). Less ornate examples of ear-rings threaded with beads are\n          found closer to Begram. One is a small gold wire ear-ring\n          threaded with two pearls found by Martin Honigberger (q.v.) with\n          late 1st-century coins in one of the relic deposits of Bimaran\n          Stupa 5 near Jalalabad (Jacquet 1938, p.168, pl.XI.10. For coin\n          types, see 1880.3740.a-k, 1880.4135.a-r, 1838,EIC.90). Other\n          examples were found in the Buddhist monastery at Palatu Dheri\n          near Charsada (Marshall 1904, p.172, fig.18.2-3). Like the\n          Begram examples, the hoop is of copper wire with spacers of\n          coiled wire, but coated with silver and threaded with small\n          spherical beads of crystal, silver or vitreous paste. The clasps\n          comprise a hook at one end and a cap at the other, or one\n          tapered end which slotted into a hole in the opposite thickened\n          end, unlike the simple loop and hook of the Begram examples. All\n          the pottery recovered from the site is pre-Islamic and the coins\n          range from Indo-Scythian to Late Kushan, suggestive of a\n          1st-3rd-century date. The early Islamic examples usually also\n          have their beads separated by a wire coiled round the hoop\n          (Zimmer 1991, nos.13-16; Gladiss 1998, nos.25, 31). The beads\n          are always threaded along the lower section of the hoop. They\n          are made of two joined hemispheres, either in openwork or\n          decorated with wires and globules; and the clasp is either\n          formed by a pin which passes through two eyelets or by a hook\n          which fits into the perforated end of a bead (Zimmer 1991,\n          nos.3-5, 13-21; Gladiss 1998, nos.7-30). On balance it seems\n          that the Begram examples belong to the pre-Islamic period.\n          Bibliography Gladiss, A. von (1998) Schmuck im Museum f\u00c3\u00bcr\n          Islamische Kunst, Berlin.
