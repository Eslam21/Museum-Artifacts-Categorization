{"Present location": "INSTITUT DE PAPYROLOGIE ET D'\u00c9GYPTOLOGIE, UNIVERSIT\u00c9 DE LILLE III [02/049] LILLE", "Inventory number": "L 1033", "Dating": "MIDDLE KINGDOM (not after); 2ND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (not before)", "Archaeological Site": "MIRGISSA", "Category": "BOWL", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; ENGRAVED", "Height": "11.1 cm", "Diameter": "16,5 cm", "Name": "Bowl", "Description": "Hemispherical bowl with a slightly restricted mouth. The inside was simply polished and preserves white traces of its contents. The exterior surface was more carefully treated: a fine layer of hematite slip has been burnished. The black border is irregular, but a 2 cm wide band has been glossed here. The incised decoration is very simple but typical of the era: a band of vertical lines at the bottom of the black border. This type of vase was generally used for cooking, though this particular piece was most probably a drinking vessel. The shape, technique and decoration are Nubian, more C-Group than Kerma, although the vase was discovered within the occupation levels of the Mirgissa/Iken fort> Possibly it was an object that was purchased from nearby Nubian populations by an Egyptian."}
