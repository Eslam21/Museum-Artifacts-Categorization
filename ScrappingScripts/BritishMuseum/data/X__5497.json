A light pink tinge is visible on all surface areas of the bowl, but especially at the lip. Two areas of the lip are chipped, forming two V-shaped chips next to each other. Another smaller area across from these two chips appears to be another chipped area in a V-shaped form. Beige encrustations and soil residue are adhered to some portions of the surface, particularly the exterior of the bowl where these areas appear in faint dots as well as covering the surface.
