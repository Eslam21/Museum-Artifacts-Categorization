According to Petrie, the cache of bronzes found in a building located in the southern part of the city provided fifty-one of this category of votive boxes (Petrie 1886, 41-42). This specimen could originate from this cache that can be dated around the end of the 5th-beginning of the 4th century BC (Masson 2015). However, Griffith signalled in his notes from January 1885, several bronze reptile cases in a trench located outside the Great Temenos (Masson forthcoming b). Votive boxes of this type were particularly associated to the solar god and demiurge Atum (Weiss 2012, 278-279). They belong to the type T 15 in the typology of animal bronzes by K. Weiss (Weiss 2012, 731-738, Taf. 42g-i, Typ T 15, esp. Nr. 771-782, 784-791 from Naukratis). Petrie, W. M. F. 1886, Naukratis.
