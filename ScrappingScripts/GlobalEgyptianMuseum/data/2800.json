{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "L1030:119", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD ?", "Archaeological Site": "THEBES: WEST BANK", "Category": "COFFIN/SARCOPHAGUS/CARTONNAGE", "Material": "LINEN; GESSO", "Technique": "PAINTED", "Width": "10 cm", "Name": "Painted cartonnage panel from a mummy", "Description": "Painted cartonnage panel from a set of mummy-casings, with a green-blue border encasing a white-background field, in which a ram-headed god to the right faces two columns of hieroglyphic text identifying him as 'Khnum-Re lord of the Cataract'. In Egyptian belief Khnum created the physical forms desired for creation by the sun-god Re. Here Khnum is fused with Re to form the composite god, as at his principal cult-centres such as Elephantine in the First Cataract region, and Esna closer to Thebes. Possibly this panel, though acquired at Thebes, was found at a site where Khnum was worshipped; it is also possible that he was included on this panel as the god of the Cataract region, housing the revivifying sources of the Nile ."}
