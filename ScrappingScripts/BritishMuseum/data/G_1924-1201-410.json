The leading vase from this group is the St Petersburg chalice from Berezan (Lemos no. 964) which bears the degenerate conical chalice form typical of the Chalice Style. The figural decoration on the vase is rendered primarily and carelessly in outline. The handle zone and rim pattern decoration are consistent with other chalices of the same style. Most of the vases in this Chalice Style group display a mixture of techniques consisting of portraying female figures in outline and dancing komasts in black figure. However, none of these features are visible on British Museum 1924,1201.410. Whilst all that is visible of the female figure is her chiton, it is not depicted in outline. Furthermore, the decorative scheme is also very similar to other sherds from Naukratis that are categorised as being in the Grand Style (British School at Athens sherd 13). This sherd would be more appropriately classified in the Grand Style. It is perhaps a late example. The number 813 is written and crossed out in pencil on the interior surface of the sherd. =A1704 is also written in pencil on the interior surface.
