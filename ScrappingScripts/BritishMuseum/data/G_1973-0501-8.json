{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.8"], "Description": [" Terracotta squatting biphallic figure of a child(?) in a Macedonian soldier's dress. Wearing chlamys and kausia, though largely naked and modelled in the round. He is seated on a largely rectangular plinth, his right knee raised. He has two large phalluses, held by each hand, one rising up to rest on his right shoulder; the other curving to his left side, its tip is lost. He wears a narrow and waisted chlamys running down his back and extending to the bottom of the plinth. He wears a kausia on his head, with his hair indicated at the back. His left knee and both feet are lost and the tip of his left phallus and his right elbow are damaged. Solid; probably made in a two-piece mould. Micaceous brown Nile silt with a red-brown surface and a thick grey-brown core; the mica particles are small. Traces remain of an overall thick white dressing, painted pink in the flesh areas; the chlamys and the kausia appear to have been left white.
