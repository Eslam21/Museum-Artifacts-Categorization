{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1405"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure female head. Head broken from the figure of a goddess, probably Aphrodite. Her hair has a central parting and is brushed back away from the face, falling in tresses beside her neck; a knot of curls is drawn up and fastened with a ring-headed pin over the parting. She wears a tall diadem with a stud near each end; it is uncertain whether she has earrings. Hollow, from two-piece mould. Traces of a white dressing, perhaps not extending to the top edge of the diadem. Red paint on top of diadem and in hair, with brighter red paint on lips. Brown Nile silt with frequent fine gold mica, white and black inclusions.
