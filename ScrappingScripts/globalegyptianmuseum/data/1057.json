{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.6421", "Dating": "18TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "CALCITE/ALABASTER", "Technique": "HEWN; POLISHED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "13 cm", "Width": "9.5 cm", "Name": "Defeated enemy", "Description": "This fragment depicts the head of an Asiatic, identifiable by his thin elongated head, and his short pointed beard. He was probably part of a group, consisting of the pharaoh standing in an heroic pose, threatening one or more foreigners with a mace while he holds them by their hair. This is a well-known iconographic theme of the New Kingdom, mostly found on temple pylons. Another example of this theme in sculpture is found, although of a lesser quality, on a statue of Ramesses IV of far inferior quality in the Cairo Museum (CG 42125)."}
