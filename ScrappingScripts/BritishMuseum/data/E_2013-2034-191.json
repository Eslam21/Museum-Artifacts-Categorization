{"artifact_name": "digital photograph(colour)", "Object Type": ["digital photograph (colour)"], "Museum number": ["2013,2034.191"], "Description": [" Digital photograph (colour); view of painted rock art on a sandstone cave wall, showing two negative right hand prints, seventy-nine human figures, one bird figure and thirty-nine unidentified shapes, all painted and infilled but for the handprints which are blown. One hand print is at the top left, the other in the centre left of the image. They are quite faint and the outlines have been blown in brown pigment. To the left of the central hand print are two running human figures facing right. The right figure (woman?) has short appendages (breasts?) hanging from beneath the arms on either side and appears to be carrying an object (bow?) in the right hand. They are running toward three tiny human figures which superimpose the hand print. To the lower right of these figures is the figure of a standing bird, upright and facing left. At the top of the image are a horizontal row of eight figures depicted as if swimming. Above them, at the top of the image, is a much larger figure in brown, upright and facing right with a missing head and apparently wearing a white armband and superimposing or superimposed by another \u2018swimming\u2019 figure. At the top right of the image is a very large human figure, upright and facing right, with a long, triangular torso, short bulky limbs and a small round head with no neck, decorated with personal ornamentation. To the right of this figure is a greenish-grey human figure of a similar size, facing right, with schematic line pattern markings crossing the torso in cream. On the far right of the image are three figures, one of which appears to be striding and facing right. At the bottom right is a large red figure facing forwards with arms extended showing items of personal ornamentation painted in cream. Adjacent on the right is n eroded red figure with legs splayed. At the bottom of the image are eighteen human figures in a horizontal row facing right. The three most prominent figures are the largest. They appear as a triad in the bottom centre of the image with narrow waists, substantial arms and legs, long necks and tiny round heads. They have identical decoration on their bodies with white stripes indicating either bands or paint at the ankles, knees and elbows. Their torsos are badly damaged through natural flaking of the rock and overlay by an old wasp\u2019s nest which impedes the view of them. Cave of Swimmers, Egypt.

Wadi Sura (also spelled Sora) is a valley on the western edge of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt\u2019s western desert. There, two shallow caves lie on the right at the entrance to the inlet, one smaller than the other and both containing rock paintings. Hans Rhotert designated the caves C and D. Cave C is the larger and contains the paintings of the famous \u2018swimming\u2019 figures inspiring those in \u2018The English patient\u2019. Cave D, which is close by, contains a single scene of cattle and archers. These caves were discovered, and the valley named, in 1933 by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy. There are several other rock art sites nearby, some discovered by Alm\u00e1sy and Rhotert in the same year, or by P. A. Clayton in 1931, and several which have subsequently been found and documented by Giancarlo Negro, Yves Gauthier, Werner Lenz, Andr\u00e1s Zboray, Werner Lenz and others."], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": [" painted rock art ", " animal ", " mammal ", " therianthropism ", " bird ", " personal-ornament ", " body ornamentation/modification ", " headgear/hairstyle ", " arms/armour ", " mythical figure/creature ", " wild cat/big cat (?)
