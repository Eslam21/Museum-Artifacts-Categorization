{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86245"], "Description": [" Complete scarab, made of glazed steatite of beige colour with remains of a light green glaze preserved. Many circumferential cracks at the back. The division between head and prothorax is shown with a single line. The division between prothorax and elytra is shown in a single line as well, as is the suture. No further details visible. The shape of the head is oval, no eyes indicated. The frontal part of the clypeus is broken off, but originally probably showed three grooves, dividing it into four lobes. The plates at the sides are shown as well. The side of the scarab shows three deep and finely carved legs on each side, no details indicated. The seal at the base shows an oval line framing the base, inside on the left a standing Thoht-figure over the full height, holding a wAs-sceptre, with crescent and sun disc. In front of the figure a mAa.t-feather, above it a sun disc and above that two short horizontal lines. The motif is very similar to 680 with Anubis and 700 with Re-Harakhte, is this the same producer? The orientation of the seal is longitudinal, as is the perforation of the object.
