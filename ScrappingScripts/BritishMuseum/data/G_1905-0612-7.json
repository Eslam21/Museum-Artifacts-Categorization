{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1905,0612.7"], "Description": [" Marble figure of a male cat with head facing to the right. The legs have been repaired and the pinned tail is lost. Fine translucent (Parian?) marble with a greenish tinge probably from Paros. Much of the body is covered with claw chisel marks, though there are no obvious traces of the marks left by the use of the running drill. There is a sharp definition between the stomach and the right leg. The underside of the cat, particularly around the genitals, is well finished. A hole in the stump of the tail shows where rest of tail was originally joined. There is no indication either of any support for the cat. A fragment of a leg has been joined to the rear right leg (reg.no.1906.6-12.18). The cat is in good condition except for the loss of all the lower legs and paws, the tail and small chips from both ears. The paws have been restored in plaster, though the originals likely survive as separate joining base fragments (GR 1905.6-12.15, 16 & 17). His rear right leg is outstretched, and the paw touching the ground gently, unlike the two legs which step forward where the paw is placed firmly on the ground, and therefore appears to be more elongated in plan. This arrangement of the paws suit perfectly the walking movement of the cat. If these paws do not belong to this particular cat, then they belong to one of a similar scale and style. The bases and the cat both have a similar, unfinished appearance about them which suggests that they do indeed belong together and the marble type is identical. The undersides of each plinth are roughly worked with a punch, perhaps in order that they should grip onto the base on which the sculpture was originally displayed.

Paw and base fragments (GR1905,0612.15, 16 and 17) purchased at the same time are also likely to come from this cat. Part of a group of 20 cat sculpture fragments in marble and limestone, many in the same style and possibly the same sculptor (GR 1905,0612.1 - 20). These include a base with a dedication to Bubastis. All were purchased by Flinders Petrie, from a dealer in Cairo who gave it a Bubastis provenance. Petrie later writes Naukratis as a probable origin. This appears to be confirmed by two marble cat sculptures in the same style, and possibly the same sculptor, in a group of artefacts from Naukratis acquired for Cairo Egyptian Museum from the nearby town of Damanhur (Edgar 1903, CG27518-9). Other limestone and terracotta figures of cats dedicated to Bubastis have been found in the recent, unpublished, excavations of an early Ptolemaic temple sanctuary at Kom el-Dika in Alexandria. However, these cats are not of marble, are in a distinctly different style (see British Museum EA1945,1012.2 probably from Kom el-Dika) and many are later than the 'Naukratis' example. The presence of cat sculptures in the Naukratis group, probably made by the same sculptor, in both imported marble and Egyptian limestone, suggest that these were all made in Naukratis, or less likely Alexandria. The surface has not been polished and so does not have a finished glossy texture as found on other examples from Naukratis (GR1905.6-12.6). The underside of the cat, particularly around the genitals, is much better finished than GR1905.6-12.6. Greek workmanship is evident in the tool mark remains. Edgar, C. C. 1903. Greek sculpture.
