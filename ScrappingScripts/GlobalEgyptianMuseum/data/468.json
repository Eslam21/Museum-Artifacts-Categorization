Hogarth. It dates from the 12th Dynasty and belongs to a certain man named Henou. The casket is considerably less decorated than that of the lady Hetepi which comes from the same excavation (see E.3036). It only bears decoration on the exterior sides. The long sides are subdivided into three framed panels of inscriptions which carry offering formulae. At the height of the head, two udjat-eyes protect the deceased and give him the possibility of attending the rebirth of the solar divinity Re every morning. On the small sides are depicted the four Sons of Horus, funerary genii."}
