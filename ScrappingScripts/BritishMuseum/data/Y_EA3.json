Like Big Number EA 5, it is probably not one of the later products of the reign. The bust has been recently identified as one of the upper parts of a pair statue of Amenhotep III and queen Tiye, the lower part of which has now been re-erected in Merenptah's mortuary temple. Merenptah reused many blocks and statues from Amenhotep III's temple, which must have been in a state of decay a century and a half after the death of its founder."], "Bibliographic references": [" Porter and Moss 1972 / Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings 2: Theban Temples (p. 452) ", " McNaught 1978 / Henry Salt: His contribution to the Collections of Egyptian Sculpture in the British Museum (p. 228) ", " James and Davies 1983 / Egyptian Sculpture (p. 36, fig. 42) ", " M\u00fcller 1988 / Die Kunst Amenophis' III und Echnatons (IV; pp. 9, 25, 33, 36, 155) ", " Vandersleyen 1990 / The sculpture in the round of Amenhotep III: types and purposes (p. 5) ", " Bryan and Kozloff 1992 / Egypt's Dazzling Sun (p. 125, fig V.1; p. 146, ref. 82; p. 469, table 4a; p. 472, table 5) ", " Kozloff et al. 1993 / Am\u00e9nophis III, le pharaon-soleil (p. 98, fig.V.1, p. 403, table 4a; p. 406, table 5) ", " Aston et al. 2000 / Stone (p. 42) ", " Strudwick 2006 / Masterpieces of Ancient Egypt (pp. 152 -153) "], "Location": ["On display (G4/CSE)"], "Condition": ["incomplete - lower part lost"], "Associated names": ["Representation of: Amenhotep III"], "Acquisition name": ["Purchased from: Henry Salt"], "Acquisition date": ["1823"], "Department": ["Egypt and Sudan"], "BM/Big number": ["EA3"], "Registration number": [".3"], "Additional IDs": [" Miscellaneous number: BS.30 (Birch Slip Number also used as registration number in Budge, Sculpture Guide\u2019; [30] still on object) "]}
