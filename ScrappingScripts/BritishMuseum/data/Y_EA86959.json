{"artifact_name": "sealing; seal-impression", "Object Type": [" sealing ", " seal-impression "], "Museum number": ["EA86959"], "Description": [" Small slightly ovoid clay bulla made of brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows a darker discolouration. One seal impression of an oval scarab-like seal-impression is preserved, showing a hieroglyphic column. At the top a round sign that might be part of a Htp, underneath 'Imn is clearly visible, maybe R' at the end, but this part of the impression is very flat and almost not visible anymore. Probably the same seal as S219 that is not preserved.
