{"artifact_name": "model; bell", "Object Type": [" model ", " bell "], "Museum number": ["EA66619"], "Description": [" Egg-shaped model bell: with circular rim damaged at the back. The front of the bell is worked to represent the face of the god Bes, and at the top a small capital supports the god's plumes, behind which a hole has been pierced to allow the suspension of the bell. The god's ears are prominent at the sides. Above the capital at the back the faience is decorated with four wavy lines; below it, and not quite centrally placed, is a hole which may have been used to support a tongue. The back is decorated with a jackal head and two lizards, of which the tails almost meet at the damaged base of the bell.
