A naked man, modelled in the round, reclining with his feet extending to his left on a plain subrectangular plinth, and leaning on a cubical block. Possibly Harpocrates, though the physique looks too mature. He holds a pot to his right side and his large phallus rises up to pass under his left arm and to curve up to his left shoulder at the back. Solid; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a thick grey-brown core and some white inclusions. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Late Period (?) ", " Ptolemaic (early, ?)
