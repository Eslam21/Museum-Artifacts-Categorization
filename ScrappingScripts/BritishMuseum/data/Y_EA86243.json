{"artifact_name": "scarab", "Object Type": ["scarab"], "Museum number": ["EA86243"], "Description": [" Scarab made of faience completely preserved. Remains of a light green glaze visible. The division between head and prothorax is shown by a single line. No further details shown on the back except for two short lines, bent inwards along the side, probably to show the division between prothorax and elytra. The head is oval in shape, the eyes are indicated faintly, one notch in the middle of the head. The clypeus shows three notches dividing it into four lobes, the plates are visible as well. The side shows three fully carved legs on each side, sitting on a base plate. The frontal leg shows small grooves indicating the hair. The seal at the base shows a thin oval line framing the base, on the left over the full height a standing Anubis figure in striding pose, facing right, holding a staff. In front of it to the right a mAa.t-feather, above it two horizontally curved lines. Underneath figure and feather a mr-sign as standing line. The motif is very similar to 687, with Thot and 700 with Re-Harakhte, is this the same producer? The sealing is oriented longitudinal as is the perforation of the object.
