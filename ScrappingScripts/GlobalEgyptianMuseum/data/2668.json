{"Present location": "NATIONAL MUSEUM OF IRELAND [30/002] DUBLIN", "Inventory number": "1920:426", "Dating": "LATE PERIOD", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "SHABTI", "Material": "FAIENCE", "Technique": "PRESSED IN A FORM/MODEL", "Height": "16.5 cm", "Name": "Faience shabti", "Description": "Green-glazed faience shabti, with long divine beard, and holding pick and hoe. The style indicates a date in the Late Period, after 700 BC. The hieroglyphic inscription in two columns down the front of the body is too crudely incised to read the name and title of the person for whose tomb the figure was intended, though the basis for the signs spelling the name may be an inscription recording a man's name Tjahorpata."}
