"], "Museum number": ["1886,0401.1375"], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta askos or flask in the form of pig or boar. The vessel has a cylindrical neck with a flaring mouth rising from the back of the pig; a spout, broken at its tip, is placed at the animal\u2019s nose. The body was thrown on the wheel and then manipulated into shape, with several applied elements: the neck of the flask, the feet, the ridged mane, the ears. The tail may have been applied or modelled from the thrown pot (its tip is broken), and the eyes were formed by pressing a hollow rod into the soft clay. Red-brown Nile silt with abundant gold mica, quartz and white inclusions. Covered, except the underbelly, with a creamy white slip. "], "Cultures/periods": [" Ptolemaic (?) ", " Roman (?)

A similar vessel was also found at Naukratis (BM1888,0601.661) and similar vessels were found at Sais or Tanis (Perdrizet 1921: no.408; von Droste zu H\u00fclschoff 1980: pl. VIII: 82, disagree on find spot). The two Naukratis examples have been given a broad Graeco-Roman date, 3rd century BC to - 3rd century AD (Bailey 2008, 3768-9). However, GR1888,0601.661 was found in a Saite period well associated with a sanctuary, the fill sealed before 525BC and associated with artefacts dating c.610/600-570/560BC. The provenance is likely Egyptian, but copying Cypriot types, with similar vessles known from Cypro-Archaic and later contexts in Cyprus (British Museum GR1926,0419.4; GR1881,0824.77; GR1881,0824.76; Buchholz 1967).
