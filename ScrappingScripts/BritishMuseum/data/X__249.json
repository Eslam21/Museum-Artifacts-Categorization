", " Worn pencilling on rear. ", " Gutch dates this piece between 150BC and 250AD based upon it's stratigraphic position (a surface find), though he mentions the possibility that it could be earlier (Hogarth 1899, pl. 12, no.143). A good parallel, possibly from the same mould was dated 5th to 4th century BC (Bayer-Niemeier 1988, pl.83.6, no.456). This was probably made in Naukratis, with examples found at the site, now in Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology (NA614, NA588) and Bristol Museum (H841). Similar style unprovenanced pieces are generally dated 5th to early 4th century BC or end of the Late Period (Fischer 1994 pl.2, no.9; T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, 52-3, nos 48-50). Bayer Niemeier, E. 1988.
