", " Close parallels from Naukratis (Higgins 1970, no.100, GR 1886,0401.1357), unprovenanced (Higgins 1970, no.101, GR 1951,0731.2) and Centuripe (Higgins 1970, no.102, 1863,0728.429), are all dated late 6th century BC and appear to be of the same fabric. The fabric, parallels and style are consistent with what was previously assigned to Rhodes, but an Ionian origin is now more likely and the piece chimes in with material from Miletus. Other parallels from Thera (Maximova 1927, 95 fig.9:1), Lindos, Ialysus and Bassae are cited by Higgins (1954, 59). Parallel from Kamiros (Jacopi 1929, fig. 106). Jacopi, G. 1929.
