A standing youthful male celebrant, dressed in a himation with a fringed end, draped over his shoulders and crossing his body to be caught over his left arm, leaving his chest and his lower right leg bare, his left uncovered from mid-thigh. He wears a pointed cap, covered with pleated cloth and touched by his raised right hand, and below which his hair is visible; the fabric is kept in place by a garland: the material on the cap does not appear to be part of a veil or of the himation, as similar headgear is worn by a man stripped to the waist, with no drapery near the cap. An apple and a pomegranate are held in his left hand, and smaller fruits are retained in the crook of his left arm; against his shoulder rests a bound sheaf of wheat. A large hole for the insertion of a separately made phallus is pierced appropriately. The back is plain except for a suspension-lug. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt with a matt brown surface, perhaps a slip.
