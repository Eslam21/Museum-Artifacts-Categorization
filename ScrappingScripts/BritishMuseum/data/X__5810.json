", " The motif displayed on this scarab does not correspond directly to any known design from the \u201cScarab Factory\u201d (on its various productions, see Gorton 1996, 91-131; Webb forthcoming). However, this association of a falcon-headed deity with an uraeus is a popular motif on early Egyptian scarabs, particularly dating to the Ramesside Period (especially under the reign of Ramses II according to Schulman 1961, p. 24), though such scarabs are still found in the Third Intermediate Period contexts (Teeter 2003, 65, no 87). The presence of such an early type of scarab in Naukratis can be interpreted in many ways: heirloom, brought from a nearby site in antiquity or by sebakhin, archaizing copy of the 25th or 26th dynasty\u2026 (on the various early scarabs from Naukratis see: Masson forthcoming). Such a motif is interpreted by some scholars as a cryptographic writing of Amun or Amun-Ra (see notably Teeter 2003, 65-67, pl. 27c-d and pl. 28a-b, no 87-90; another close example quoted by Drioton 1957, 25, no. 83).
