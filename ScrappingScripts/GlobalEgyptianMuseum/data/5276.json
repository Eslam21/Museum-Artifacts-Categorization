{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "6613", "Dating": "26TH DYNASTY", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FIGURINE/STATUETTE", "Material": "BRONZE", "Technique": "FULL CAST", "Height": "17.5 cm", "Width": "6.45 cm", "Depth": "6.2 cm", "Name": "Statuette of a king making offerings", "Description": "This bronze statuette shows the king in a kneeling posture with his hands holding two globular nu-pots which were used in wine offerings. This type of statue was dedicated in the temples as a votive gift, probably in combination with a statue of the deity to whom the offering was made. The bronzes are reduced versions of the stone statues erected in the temples. The king is dressed in a short pleated kilt which is kept in position by a narrow belt. The pleats have been incised in the bronze. The Lower Egyptian crown is on his head, albeit without the spiralling wire or the uraeus. The king is sitting on his feet, his toes are flexed and splayed. The lower legs are kept apart up to the ankles. The body with its broad shoulders appears strong. The collarbone and the larynx are pronounced. The musculature on the chest appears triangular, with the nipples standing out clearly. The deep navel with a long furrow up to the breastbone is a characteristic detail, as is the wide furrow on the back. The pelvis is pronounced and separated from the waist. The face appears individualized because of its fleshy cheeks and the broad lower part. Only the left eye has the pupil indicated. The bridge of the nose is slightly bent. The chin is short and protruding, progressing downwards into a curved throat. The modelling of the body and the face is similar to that on statuary of kings from the second half of the 26th Dynasty, which suggests a date within this period. The figure is a solid cast."}
