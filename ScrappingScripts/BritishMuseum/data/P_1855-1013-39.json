The present drawing does not, however, bear any of the Spencer collection's marks (see L.1530). Entry from Martin Royalton-Kisch, \u2018Catalogue of drawings by Rembrandt and his school\u2019, 2010, Willem Drost, cat. no.3. The subject is from 'Genesis', XL, 1-4: Joseph is imprisoned and charged with the care of Pharaoh's butler and baker who have also been confined. There he correctly interprets their dreams. The drawing appears to show Joseph listening to the baker describing his dream. The same subject appears in an anonymous pupil's version (Gg,2.249), and Rembrandt's drawing, cat. no.24 verso (Gg,2.248) represents the related scene of Joseph interpreting the dreams. The sheet resembles the many biblical drawings made by Rembrandt in the 1650s, with their somewhat geometrical and rectilinear approach to form. Yet comparisons with drawings now generally ascribed to Willem Drost, who adopted almost identical calligraphic formulae for his figures, suggest that the present work is by him. Characteristic of Drost rather than Rembrandt are the proliferation of parallel hatching of rather unvaried pressure, the limited range of facial expression and the unpersuasive spatial interrelationship of the figures: Joseph, for example, here seems nearer the spectator than the further prisoner, but stands beyond the stocks in which the latter is placed. Comparable works ascribed to Drost include the 'Triumph of Judith' and 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' in the Museum's collection (Benesch nos.A93-94) and the 'David and Nathan' in Moscow (Benesch A98; Sumowski 547ax).[1] The attribution to Drost suggests a date in the first half of the 1650s, either during or not long after his apprenticeship to Rembrandt which probably occurred in the years around 1650. The slight sketch of a head in profile on the verso, which was discovered when the drawing was lifted from its old mount in about 1960, is also Rembrandtesque and resembles his 'Five Sketches of Haman's Head' in the Rijksmuseum (Benesch 1005), which dates from about the same period, but the comparison again reveals differences with Rembrandt's own work.[2] A copy of the recto was in the Novak collection in Prague.[3] NOTES: [1] The disparities between these and Rembrandt's drawings become clearer when they are set alongside those of a comparable type that are accepted as the master's work in Amsterdam, 1985, nos.37-44, Rotterdam, 1988, nos.22, 32 and 33, and Exh. Paris, 1988-9, nos.50, 58 and 59. The comparisons made by Benesch (see Lit. below) include one with his no.1006 which closely resembles Drost's work; his other comparison, with his no.1003, is not persuasive. [2] The Rijksmuseum's drawing is dated c.1657 by Schatborn in Amsterdam, 1985, no.47. The comparison was first made by White in c.1960 (notes in Museum files), who rediscovered the sketch on the verso. [3] As first noted by HdG. It was formerly in the Festetits collection, Klinkosch sale, Wawra, 15 April, 1889, lot 726, and repr. Sch\u00f6nbrunner and Meder 448 when in the Novak coll.
