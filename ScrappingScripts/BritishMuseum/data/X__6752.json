This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " According to the Egypt Exploration Fund list, the Redpath Museum received in 1887 several \"paste objects\" from the Scarab Factory, along with two moulds. This amulet might come from such a context. In addition to scarabs which were mass-produced especially for export, wedjat eyes, mainly in glazed composition but also in hard stone, form the main type of amulets found at Naukratis. Amulet with universal power of protection (Germond 2005, 25), the wedjat eye, simple or multiple, is one of the most common amulet on settlements of the Late Period (Masson forthcoming).
