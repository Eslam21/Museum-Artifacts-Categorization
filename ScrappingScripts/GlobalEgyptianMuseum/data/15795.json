It is carved both inside and out in sunk relief with scenes of Ramesses the Second making offerings to the gods of Heliopolis. On the exterior, there are three forms of the sun: Re-Horakhty crowned with the sun disk, Atum with the Double Crown, and Khepri with the Nemes headdress and the sun disk. The titles of King Ramesses and various formulas of good omen surround the figures. The back shows the sky god Geb and the air god Shu, both receiving offerings. The roof is decorated with a series of vultures with outstretched wings.The interior of the naos is conceived as a rock-cut chapel. The rear wall of the chapel displays the figures of three seated deities, cut almost freestanding from the wall. Atum appears on the left, Amun-Re in the center, and Khepri on the right."}
