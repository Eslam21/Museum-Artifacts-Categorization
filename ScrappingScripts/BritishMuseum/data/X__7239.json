This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Although Lemos does not attribute this sherd to any group or painter, certain elements found in the decoration suggest that it ought to belong to the Naukratis Painter or the Naukratis Painter\u2019s Group. The painter and the group are named after a chalice found at Naukratis and the slip on all vessels from this group is a light beige to almost creamy white. Rim patterns are very simple and there is no filling ornament. The depiction of figures however, is very elaborate. Clothing is rendered highly decorated and naked skin is expertly portrayed. In this instance, the knee cap on the 697.7 is the same as that on British Museum 1888,0601.512. The use of colour is also the same as that on other sherds attributed to the same artist and group.
