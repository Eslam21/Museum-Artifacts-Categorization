Fischer 1994: no. 982; Bailey 1996a: 210, fig. 2. A possible occasion for the manufacture of such a figure is the defeat of the Jewish Revolt in ad 118: this uprising had a profound and damaging effect in Egypt, as elsewhere. Comparandum. A slightly more complete example in T\u00fcbingen, from the same or a parallel mould, shows that Hadrian was wearing a chlamys (paludamentum) and thus may be a cuirassed figure (Fischer 1994: no. 982 = Vogt 1924: pl. xliii:2).
