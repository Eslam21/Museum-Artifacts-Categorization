{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA35622"], "Description": [" Sycomore fig wood stela : this round-topped stela originally contained one scene. At the top appears to have been a curved sky-sign beneath which was a sun-disk with uraei. On either side of the disk is an 'wedjat'-eye and beneath the disk are some traces of signs which appear to read the 'Behdetite'. On the right stood a woman with her arms raised in adoration. In the centre was an altar piled with offerings above which were at least three columns of text, now lost. On the left stood the god Ra-Horakhty. The stela is in a poor state of preservation. The scene is nearly effaced and plaster has been lost in several places. The background appears to have been white. The disk, the dress and fillet of the lady, and part of the offerings are red. The face and kilt of the god are white, the beak black and the wig blue with black stripes. The wig of the lady is black. The signs under the disk are red, as may have been the hieroglyphs elsewhere, but these are now effaced. The plaster remains on the back and sides of the stela.
