{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA51101"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of Khaemwaset and his wife Nebettawy: Khaemwaset and Nebettawy sit side by side on a low-backed chair. As on most statues of couples, he is on the proper right, which was the dominant side. Their faces mimic Amenhotep III's round cheeks (artfully made up), slanted eyes, and ingenuous expression. Their costumes and accessories are carefully depicted. Khaemwaset, seems almost modestly dressed. Though his wig resembles a double wig, it consists of just one layer. His kilt is narrow; only the stiffened front panel is pleated. He does not wear the floppy-sleeved shirt that seems to have been standard male dress attire at this time. Instead, his torso and left upper arm are wrapped in a length of cloth that has been wound around him twice, as we can see from the careful rendering of the looped selvedge across his chest in two layers. In onehand he holds a rolled, folded cloth that, coincidentally or not, resembles the hieroglyphic sign for \"health.\" Against his chest he holds a club-shaped plant that almost certainly represents a stalk of cos lettuce. This plant, an emblem of the god Min, symbolized virility. Nebettawy's modish full wig and multistranded collar necklace have relatively little carved detail, but they may have been further elaborated in paint. A filmy, pleated over-wrap covers her left arm and hip. Her right arm passes behind her husband's back, with her hand resting behind his right shoulder. This was a standard gesture for a married woman; almost always, as here, it resulted in an unrealisticelongation of the unseen arm. Her other gesture is much more unusual: with her left hand touches Khaemwaset's left elbow. To us, this gesture may seem tender and rather sweet. To the Egyptians, however, it seems to have signified something rather different.
