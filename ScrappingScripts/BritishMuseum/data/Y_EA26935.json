{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA26935"], "Description": [" Fragmentary schist figure of the head and upper body of a king, much of the body and base now missing. The king is depicted wearing the nemes headcloth with wide striped lappets which extend down past the shoulders, the tips of the cloth now lost. The material is also tucked behind the large ears, and the wide horizontal band of the nemes is set low on the forehead. Above this and the king\u2019s forehead is the coiled body of the uraeus cobra, now headless. The shoulders appear to be bare, and what survives of the neck does not appear to suggest any jewellery worn. The eyes are narrow and slanted, with a heavy lower eyelid and sunken skin underneath the eye area. A thin line above conveys the eyebrows, which converge at the bridge of the nose. Much of the face is now damaged, but the face appears fleshy and rounded particularly around the jawline. In addition to the damage and loss of the figure from the neck and across the upper body, the nose and mouth have also been damaged, with large chips visible across the lower portion of the king\u2019s face. There are also chips visible to the nemes cloth at the left side edge and across the top of the head.

This object originates from the Theban site of Qurna, though an exact findspot is unknown. Further Bibliography: S.
