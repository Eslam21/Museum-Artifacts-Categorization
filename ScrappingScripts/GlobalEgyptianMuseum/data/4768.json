His name was Min-Montu, and he was called Senres, meaning \"The brother has awakened again\". It seems likely that an older brother died before his birth and his parents recognised their dead child in the new-born. He lived during the reign of the first king of the 18th Dynasty, Ahmose. The underside is inscribed with the heart spell."}
