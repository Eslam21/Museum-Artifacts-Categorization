{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1973,0501.74"], "Description": [" Upper part of terracotta figure of Harpokrates. He is naked and has a large phallus, damaged, probably reaching to his knees. The head is shaven, with a large side-lock. At his left side, his lowered left hand is clenched into a fist; it was pierced before firing to insert an attribute of another substance. The right arm is raised but the hand is lost: it probably had the palm out-turned. The back is undecorated, with a circular vent. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous light-brown Nile silt. The front of the figure has a red slip; there are traces of an overlying white dressing in some areas.

These parallels come from Naukratis, the most likely find spot and production place for these objects, based on the style, fabric, date of the figures and history of the Greece and Rome department\u2019s holdings of Egyptian material (73% are from Naukratis). Similarities dated to the first half of the third century BC (?) (Fischer 1994, no. 560); and also to the late first century BC (Skupinska-L\u00f8vset 1978, no. UT 118) The products of the plaster mould are similar, but have a Double Crown; the mould is said to be from the Fayum and is dated first century BC. (Philipp 1972, fig. 48). Also similar to the plaster figure from Saqqara, dated Late Period or Ptolemaic. (Martin 1981, pl. 24, 302). The \u2018Antinoopolis(?)\u2019 provenance for the Late Period to Ptolemaic parallels currently in the Fitzwilliam is dubious. The Fitzwilliam parallels most likely come from Naukratis (Petrie and Gardner 1884-1886) or less likely Memphis (Petrie 1907 and 1914). Fischer, J. 1994.
