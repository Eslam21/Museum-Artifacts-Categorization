On the upper part is a scene in sunk relief, showing a group of deities standing beneath a winged solar disc. The ibis-headed god Thoth, on the right, stands facing Osiris, Isis and Horus. Osiris stands on a pedestal from which rise two serpents representing the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, and a lotus flower supporting small figures of the four Sons of Horus. The lower portion of the stela is occupied by a hieroglyphic text in twelve vertical columns. It is an invocation to a series of deities, including Osiris, Horus, Isis, Wepwawet and Thoth. At the lower right is a figure of the dedicator of the monument, the Scribe of the Army of the Lord of the Two Lands Kenro. Kneeling at his feet and holding a lotus flower is a woman identified as 'his sister' (probably his wife), the Lady of the House Hunero.
