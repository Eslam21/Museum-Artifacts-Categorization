The break occurs below the nail bed and runs obliquely across to the underside of the finger. Both sides of the finger still have traces of what is probably the stone joining it to its neighbouring fingers, reaching as high as the nail bed on both sides.The nail, which is slightly curved at the nail bed and broadens towards the tip, is represented by means of an indentation with slanting rounded edges at the three sides connected with the finger. The top of the nail, which is slightly raised above the finger tip, is indicated by means of a carved line. On the underside of the finger tip is a slight curve leading towards a supporting surface (an upper thigh?)."}
