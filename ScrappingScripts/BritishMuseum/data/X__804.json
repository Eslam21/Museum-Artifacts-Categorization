{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Limestone figure of a female worshipper standing. She is wearing a long chiton. The smooth skirt falls almost vertically to the ground. Below the curved border of the lower hemline the naked feet stand on an oblique plinth which is as wide as the skirt. The feet are worked less carefully with the toes indicated only by means of grooves in the rectangular foot. The back is rounded and roughly rendere, giving the figure a lentoid cross-section. Fragment of lower body from knees down and plinth.

", " Faint pencilling on rear, \u03a68? ", " This figure is one of the few - along with London B452 (Nick 2006, cat.23) and Boston 86.159 - to be securely ascribed to a group of female statuettes wearing a simple long garment which coincides with Yon's type I. The broad plinth and the naked separated feet remind of examples from Yon's Group I F. It is a late example of an early group of female figures from Naukratis. Nick 2006, cat. 24, p. 114, pl. 13; pp. 59-60 ", " Cypriot figure plaques of female worshipers devoting objects or sacrificing animals, often with flat unworked backs come in a range of related forms and were distributed widely across Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean entrepos, incorporating aspects considered Cypriot, Egyptianising and Ionian (Nick 2006, 59, Type 2.1; Yon 1973, Types 1 B, C and F). Nick dates variants within this group to 600-575BC (Nick 2006, N23-27), 600-550BC (N28-40) and 550-525BC (N41-42). Some have late 7th century BC terracotta parallels imported by the Phoenician\u2019s (Nick 2006, 60-61, no. N26-29). The dating of these and related pieces should be revised following the re-dating of the stratigraphic phasing of Samos from where parallels were cited (Schmidt 1968; revised by Henke 2011). Also new parallels from stratified deposits in Samos, Miletus and Knidus (Berges 2006; Tuna et al 2009; Senff 2009; Henke 2011; 2013), mean that the terminus ante quem for this type should be revised down from 560/550BC to 570/560BC. These have not been found in the earliest layers in Naukratis dated c.620-600BC, or indeed in 630/620BC levels in Miletus and Samos (Henke 2011; 2013), suggesting that the majority were imported c.600-570, possibly as late as 560BC. In Naukratis this type of figure was found only in Saite period levels, including the Sanctuary of Apollo bothros in Naukratis (A\u03a0 3-4) and the Sanctuary of Aphrodite (contexts \u03a63, 5, 8, 10, and well 2 context \u03a6B).
