{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA85690"], "Description": [" Fragment of an ostracon from a pottery vessel, showing four lines of hieratic text written in black ink at the outside, parallel to the rim but in quite thick writing. The sherd is part of a plate or bowl with a red rim at the inside and edge, probably 20cm in diameter. The object shows a fresh break and might therefore join other fragments. The vessel was made of Nile clay with chaff and mica inclusions, it was wheel made and shows white and black accretions at the inside and possible salt at the outside.
