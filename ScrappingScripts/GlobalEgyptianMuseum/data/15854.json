{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "CG 25194", "Dating": "RAMESSES IV/USERMAATRE-SETEPENAMUN", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "OSTRACON", "Material": "LIMESTONE", "Technique": "CARVED; GRAFFITO", "Name": "Ostracon with Title of Ramesses the Fourth", "Description": "The artist made more than one sketch on this ostracon. Presumably, the powerful bull was drawn first on a base line. The artist then added an arm holding a rod as well as a seated goddess, Maat. Her legs are bent tightly to her body and she is holding an Ankh, the sign of life. A separate Ankh was added later. Since the bull was drawn first, his strength and weight were given the most attention. At a later stage, the artist used his wide brush to draw the other signs, which have faded in many places. A group of hieroglyphic signs form the name of King Ramesses the Fourth. The whole group describes the king as \"Mighty Bull, Living in Truth.\""}
