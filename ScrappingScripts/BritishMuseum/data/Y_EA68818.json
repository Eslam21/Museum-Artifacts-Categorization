{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA68818"], "Description": [" Limestone fragmentary figure of a ram, lower legs and base now missing. The figure is clearly identified as a ram by the long curved horns detailed on either side of the head. The body, legs and tail are crudely carved, with stone fill remaining underneath the belly of the animal on both sides. The ram appears to stride forward with the front left leg, with the right shown slightly behind. The condition of the stone has eroded, and there appears to be no surviving traces of paint. In addition to the broken areas, there are several chips to the stone surface at the face and hind of the ram, and along the right side of the animal at the belly and rear right leg. A marking in pencil of an early registration number is handwritten on the left side of the stone fill underneath the ram\u2019s body.

Within recent studies it has been argued to have likely originated from the Great Temenos site at Naukratis, given that this was the site of the cult for Amun-Ra Baded (Yoyotte 1983; Guermeur 2005), which appears to also have been accepted in more recent publications (Thomas 2015). Ram figures appear to be rare at Naukratis; in addition to the British Museum figure, two parallels are known (possibly Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge NA309; an unprovenanced similar figure dated to the Late Period is also now in the Petrie Museum, London UC 60056).
