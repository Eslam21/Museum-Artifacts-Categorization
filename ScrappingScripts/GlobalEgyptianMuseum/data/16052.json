The Greek letters \"IB\" represent the denomination of the coin. The \"I\" stands for 10 and the \"B\" stands for 2 for a total of 12 nummia.

Along with the bust of Justinian, the front side of the coin has a Latin legend starting with DN, the abbreviation of \"Dominus Noster,\" or Our Lord. The legend continues with the name of the emperor and ends with his titles \"PPAVG,\" or Perpetuus Augustus, or a similar phrase. Beneath the exergual line is the name of the mint in Greek. The exergual line separates the portion of the coin that is beneath the main design. Only the first four letters of the name of the mint are present."}
