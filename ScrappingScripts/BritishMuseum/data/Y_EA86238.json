The division between head and prothorax is shown with a very faint single line, only preserved on the right. The division between prothorax and elytra and the suture is shown in a single line as well. The humeral callosities are marked with an askew line underneath the division line of prothorax and elytra, so that it forms a triangle with the outer for of the body. The head is oval in shape, the clypeus is almost not visible anymore. The side of the scarab shows three fully carved legs on each side, sitting on a base plate, no details are carved, no lines. The seal at the base shows a thin oval line framing the base. In the middle a Dd-pillar, left and right of it each an uraeus facing to the pillar. The orientation of the seal is longitudinal as is the perforation of the object.
