Skull - Mouth closed. All teeth present. Cervical spine intact. No fractures. Thorax and Abdomen - Ribs, vertebral column, pelvis, and hips normal. No fractures or dislocations. A large cylindrical mass of solidified resin, which appears to have been divided into four parts, occupies the right side of the body cavity, and a smaller, single, reniform mass is in the left side of the abdomen. The resin, which was fluid when introduced, formed four pools which afterwards solidified. The pelvis has been filled with a round mass of packing. Above the large pack is a ball of linen, and probably sawdust as often in mummies of this period. Arms - Extended. Hands with extended fingers and their palmar surfaces on the anterior aspect of the thighs. Legs - Bones and joints appear normal. There is a considerable quantity of linen packing between the thighs, possibly containing the viscera, as often in mummies of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.
