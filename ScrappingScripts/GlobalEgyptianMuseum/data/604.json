{"Present location": "KMKG - MRAH [07/003] BRUSSELS", "Inventory number": "E.3984", "Dating": "NEW KINGDOM", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "FUNERARY CONE", "Material": "POTTERY", "Technique": "FORMED BY HAND; UNSPECIFIED", "Height": "12 cm", "Diameter": "8.5 cm", "Name": "Funerary cone", "Description": "The \"funerary cones\", which appeared from the 11th Dynasty particularly at Thebes, are in fact a special form of seals presenting at their base a short offering formula or more simply the titles and the name of the deceased. One does not only find them inside or near the tombs of the beneficiaries, but also in the sanctuaries  where the offerings in favour of the gods were also reserved for the deceased. This example, which was acquired in Cairo in 1901 by J. Capart, bears on its base two flat circles in the form of a cartouche mentioning the name of the owner and his wife. It dates from the New Kingdom."}
