{"artifact_name": "bowl", "Object Type": ["bowl"], "Museum number": ["EA64163"], "Description": [" Fragment of bowl: an unusual fragment with a chequer-board pattern closely following those found in fused bowls from the tomb of Amenhotep II. The bowl, of opaque white glass with glossy interior and matt exterior, was moulded. Impressed on both the exterior and interior surfaces are registers of opaque red squares and translucent dark-blue squares, alternating. The squares are arranged so that a red and a blue square touch only at their corners. The result is that the white body shows through in the form of a square between all coloured squares. The squares are of very irregular shape, some in fact being rectangles. In no case does an impressed square penetrate to the opposite surface.
