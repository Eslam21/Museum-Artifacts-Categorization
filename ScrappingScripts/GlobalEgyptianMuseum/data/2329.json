The blue and the mud both evoke the theme of fertility. In clearing the temple of Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty, the Egypt Exploration Fund discovered large numbers of votive offerings placed as prayers or thanks to the goddess Hathor. Many of these offerings seem to have been made by women, and were probably intended to guarantee fertility and safe birth."}
