Chalice Style chalices (including patterned chalices) have little decoration on their interior and exterior; given the size of the sherd, it may come from an undecorated part of the chalice. Kantharoi Type B (See Williams, D. \u2018Aigina, Aphaia-Tempel 5. The pottery from Chios\u2019, Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger 1983, 169) also have very little decoration.
