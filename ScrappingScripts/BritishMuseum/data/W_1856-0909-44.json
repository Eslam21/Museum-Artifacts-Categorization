We have to envisage the floors of the Assyrian palaces as covered in brightly coloured textiles. The doorways, instead, sometimes had hard-wearing imitation carpets such as this. The lotus and bud motif originated in Egypt, spread to Phoenicia and became popular in Assyria towards the end of the eighth century. Phoenician textiles were imported to Assyria, and the design of this stone carpet may have been based on them.
