Numerous terracotta moulds for scarabs, scaraboids and amulets were discovered at the site (on the various productions from the Scarab Factory see Webb, forthcoming). Petrie published a similar type to this mould (Petrie 1886, 37, pl. XXXVIII, 12, just profile of the impression published). Gorton, A.
