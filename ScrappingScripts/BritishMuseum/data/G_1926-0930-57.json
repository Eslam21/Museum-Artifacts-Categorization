{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["1926,0930.57"], "Description": [" Front of head of terracotta figure of Aphrodite. A head, probably of Aphrodite, broken from a large figure. The hair is parted in the centre and falls in waves on each side, covering the upper ears. It is uncertain whether ball earrings are worn, but it seems likely that they are. The neck has the horizontal folds often found on figures of the goddess. The extreme lower edge of a diadem survives above the hair. Hollow; two-piece mould. Micaceous orange-red Nile silt with a brown surface. Considerable amounts of post-firing colour remain: it is covered with a white dressing and the hair is painted black, with wisps and curls of hair shown at the edge of the hairline; black is also used to outline the eyes, for the pupils and the eyebrows; the eyes are filled in with blue; the area between the eyes and the eyebrows is painted red, as also are the tear ducts; red is used on the lips, the nostrils, the ears and the putative earrings, where, on the right side, the red is laid over an area of yellow paint; red paint is used on one of the folds of the neck; the diadem is white.
