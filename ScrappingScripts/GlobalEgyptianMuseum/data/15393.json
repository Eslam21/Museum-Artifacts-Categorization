To the right, the husband is shown wearing the clothes of an influential person of his time, which is a full, billowing, linen garment finely pleated and a pair of sandals. His right hand is flat upon his knees and the blocked-out ends of a long handkerchief may be seen descending from his clenched left hand. Roy wears a long, tight, pleated dress and a long thick wig surmounted by a lotus flower. Resting her left hand flat on her knee, she touches her husband's shoulder with her right."}
