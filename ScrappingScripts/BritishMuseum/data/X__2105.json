{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Head of female terracotta figure wearing her hair in back in a sakkos. Mould-made and following Tanagra types. Broken off at neck where it was once inserted into the body; mouldmade, solid. Head slightly turned to right, waves of hair above forehead taken back, details indicated only at front, probably wearing sakkos; long bands hanging down on both sides of the neck (partly broken off on right, entirely broken off on left) may be ties of sakkos, unless they are meant to be huge earrings, though they are not in the right position for earrings. Narrow vertical raised feature on top of head may be an accidental blob. Surface partly worn and battered, particularly at nose and mouth; at the back of the head, large fragment broken off. Micaceous Nile silt clay, brown surface and grey core sandwiching a pink-brown layer.
