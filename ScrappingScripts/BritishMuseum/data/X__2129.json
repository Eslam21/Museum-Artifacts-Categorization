{"artifact_name": "plaque; figure", "Object Type": [" plaque ", " figure "], "Description": [" Egyptian terracotta figure plaque of goddess. A plaque in the form of a shrine, with a triangular pediment once containing a segment of a circle, and an architrave supported by columns in the form of two lotus sceptres that rise up to the architrave. A small architectural moulding projects from the pediment. Within the shrine is a naked female deity, with her right arm across her waist, her left hands by her side. She wears a high wig. Her features are exaggerated with a long nose and bulging eyes. The back is flat and the edges knife-trimmed at an angle. Made by pressing into a plaster one-piece mould. The front is covered with white traces, possibly of paint or a slip. Red-brown Nile silt, with a thick red core, abundant fine gold mica and rounded quartz, some small white inclusions. Broken, missing bottom half.

This record is included in the British Museum database as part of the Museum\u2019s Naukratis Project, a research collaboration that aims to virtually re-unite finds from the ancient port city of Naukratis, now distributed over 80 museums worldwide. ", " Rare variants of the more common nude female plaques of the Nile delta, these examples of nude females in a shrine with triangular pediment, sometimes have architraves supported by columns in the form of two standing Bes figures on reclining lions. Examples from Naukratis (Oxford AN1909.1169; British Museum 1886,0401.1458;) and attributed to Naukratis (Bolton 1966.92.A; British Museum 1885,1010.28-9; Bailey 2008, no. 3109; Petrie 1884\u20135, 173; Walters 1929, 39, fig. 28; Polaczek- Zdanowicz 1975, 139 n.17; Fischer 1994, 85 n.122). P-F.4.1 (Bolton example AN1909.1169 ) appears to be an earlier variant, based upon its similar style to type P-F.3, than P-F.4.2, which itself shows significant variation (Compare British Museum 1885,1010.28-9). Parallel from Memphis (Petrie Museum UC33574). Later variant of P-F.3 and L-F.2. Dated 5th to 4th century BC, though Bailey dates one example to the 4th to 3rd century BC (Bailey 2008, no. 3109; see also Petrie 1884\u20135, 173; Walters 1929, 39, fig. 28; Polaczek- Zdanowicz 1975, 139 n.17; Fischer 1994, 85 n.122; see also Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, no. 1896- 1908.E4679). Similar limestone carving dated Saite to beginning of the Ptolemaic period, with the shrine supported by Hathor-columns, with Bes-figures on high pedestals flanking the goddess (von Bissing 1931, 18, points out that this type of wig was most popular in Saite times). Another small limestone relief from Tell el-Yahudiya in the British Museum, (BM 1875,0517.100) is similar, but has papyrus-columns, and the figure of the goddess stands between a gate with a broken lintel, which supports sistrum-like Hathor-capitals. Hathor-capitals are also found on a limestone shrine from Athribis, from a late third to 2nd century BC context (My\u015bliwiec 1996b, 10, fig. 2). Several figures from Mendes are similar, some within a shrine, from 4th to 3rd century BC context (Redford 1988, 67, pl. 22d). Various similar examples (Weber 1914, no. 199; Petrie Museum UC50489), including one dated Late Period and early Ptolemaic (T\u00f6r\u00f6k 1995, no. 203). The shrine compares with a probably 3rd to 2nd century BC example with Bes- pillars and lions (or sphinxes), but with Athena in the temple (LIMC iii (2): pl. 77:22). Fischer, J. 1994.
