{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["2001,0329.1"], "Description": [" Terracotta figure of Isis-Thermuthis in a shrine. Isis-Thermuthis, with a cobra's body and the torch of Demeter, in a shrine surmounted by a stylized cobra-frieze. She wears a schematic horn and disc crown, and a necklace with a circular pendant. The shrine is supported by a flat-fronted plinth with reliefs of the Sothic dog of Isis, and a bird, probably a Horus Falcon, flanking a simple swag. Hollow; two-piece mould: the back is plain, with a small circular firing-vent. The underside has been smoothed, probably in modern times. Micaceous orange-brown Nile silt, with very few traces on the front of a white dressing.
