The statue depicts a lady with long wings standing on a flat pedestal that is slipped into a roughly executed base. Her facial features are defined by low relief lines that indicate the eyelids, the small smiling lips, and the large ears. The three vertical cuts on each of her cheeks illustrate a Nubian custom. A round hole was cut on top of her head to hold a sun disk. She wears a painted collar around her neck. The upper part of her body is nude and a long, wide skirt reveals only the front of her sandaled feet, which are carefully portrayed. Her arms are held to her sides and her right hand holds a cylindrical object. The Ba statue was originally Egyptian, but placing this type of statue outside the tomb became common in Nubia."}
