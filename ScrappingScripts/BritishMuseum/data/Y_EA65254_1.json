{"artifact_name": "sistrum", "Object Type": ["sistrum"], "Museum number": ["EA65254"], "Description": [" Fragment of arched bronze sistrum: richly decorated and with an inscribed handle. The arch has been broken off within the grooved sockets on top of the capital; at the base of the arch are the remains of either a seated cat or uraeus. The capital has seven uraei both front and back; on each side are three uraei, the central one in both cases containing the head of the pin for fixing the arch; they all have the sun disc. The double Hathor head has an unusually long wig, elaborately plaited and curled; the floral necklace has apparently nine chains. There are sockets for two lateral uraei, which are missing. Beneath both shoulders is a pattern made up of a central rectangle surrounded on the four sides by groups of incised pairs of lines. The cylindrical handle is inscribed with a column of hieroglyphs, both front and back, and the sides are decorated with a feathered pattern; there are two bands of floral decoration at the top, and a separate base-cap with six groups of 'nh and w\u0292s symbols, each resting on a nb sign; on the bottom is a stylized floral pattern.
