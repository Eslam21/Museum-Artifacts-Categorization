Her hands probably held the Was scepter, symbol of prosperity and well being, and the Ankh, symbol of life. However, they are both lost. She wears a long tunic and the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The statue stands on a rectangular base. The goddess Neith was very popular during the Early Dynastic Period and at the start of the Old Kingdom. However, her importance lessened during the Middle and New Kingdoms. The hieroglyphic symbol of her name, the two bows united, defines her character as \"the lady of hunting.\" She was a warrior who was able to ward off danger. She was considered to be a protectress and sorcerer."}
