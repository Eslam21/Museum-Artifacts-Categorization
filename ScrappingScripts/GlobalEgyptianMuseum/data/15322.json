It consists of four registers, or sections; the upper one shows harvesting and threshing. The second register depicts the counting and sorting of grain and the registration of the scribes and workmen in front of the granaries. The third register shows scenes of workers preparing jars and filling them with beer. Other workers make bread and between them are two women, one sifting out grain and the other grinding it. The lowest register is one of the rare scenes of sculptors at work. It depicts the scene of manufacturing vases. They finish sculpting and polishing two statues. Others are goldsmiths who are busy in weighing, smelting, and beating out metal. It is interesting to find here the explanation of the scenes and the dialogue of the workmen written in hieroglyphs, such as: \"The filling up of beer\" or \"Straining and Grinding.\" One workman is encouraging his comrade to \"Grind it well!\" The other responds, \"I am grinding it with all my strength!\""}
