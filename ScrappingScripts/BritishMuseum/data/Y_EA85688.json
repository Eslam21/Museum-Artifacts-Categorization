{"artifact_name": "ostracon", "Object Type": ["ostracon"], "Museum number": ["EA85688"], "Description": [" Fragment of an ostracon from a pottery vessel, showing parts of three lines in hieratic writing in black ink, the upper of the first line is broken off. The sherd is quite large and part of a big storage vessel. The lower part of the sherd is quite roughly finished, the upper part is more smoothed. Across the sherd two impressions of a string from the drying of the vessel. Since the sherd is so thick and tall, it seems unsuitable to have been an ostracon and might therefore have been written on the complete vessel (?). The sherd was part of a large closed vessel, partly wheel made, Nile clay. Parts of the outer surface (left hand side) might show traces of a red slip.
