{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA360"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Nakhy: this round-topped stela consists of one scene with figures in shallow sunk relief and incised texts. On the left a figure, with a sidelock of youth and a cone upon his head, wearing a broad collar and kilt, is seated on a chair with animal legs. He is holding a lotus-bud in one hand and is stretching the other over a table piled with offerings which stands before him. He is identified as Sitpair by the text which is inscribed above him. A figure stands on the right holding two bouquets before Sitpair, and a line of text at the bottom of the stela indicates that it was made by or for the workman Nakhy who must be the standing figure. This stela is well preserved with much colour still remaining. Red paint appears on the bodies of the figures and in the dividing lines between the columns of hieroglyphs. Traces of black paint can be seen in the hieroglyphs and on the chair. There is a touch of blue paint on the collar below Sitpair's right shoulder. The pupils of the eye-sign are painted in black and not incised.

Sitpair is in fact the deified Prince Ahmose Sipair who was the subject of a funerary cult after his death (A. Rowe, 'Annales du Service des Antiquiti\u00e9s de l'\u00c9gypte' 40 (1940), 39-40; M.

Schmitz, Amenophis I : Versuch einer Darstellung der Regierungszeit eines \u00e4gyptischen Herrschers der fr\u00fchen 18. Dynastie' (Hildesheim, 1978), 46-9). The spelling Sitpair with the otiose 't' is attested at Deir el-Medina at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty (see M .Tosi and A. Roccati, 'Stele e altre epigrafi di Deir el Medina. (n. 50001-50262) : Pubblicate con il contributo del Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche' (Turin, 1972)). Several workmen named Nakhy are known, but, as this stela can be attributed on stylistic grounds to the late Eighteenth Dynasty, Nakhy can be identified with Nakhy, the husband of Nefertari, of stela (1843,0507.5), one of whose sons was named Sitpair (Tosi and Roccati, 'Stele, 50010').
