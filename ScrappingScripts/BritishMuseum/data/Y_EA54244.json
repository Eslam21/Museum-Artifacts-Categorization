During the Third Intermediate Period, mummification practices changed and the packages containing the embalmed internal organs were no longer placed in Canopic Jars, but were returned to the body cavity, each with an amulet of the relevant Canopic deity attached. Although later Canopic packages came to be placed once more inside jars or within the mummy wrappings, an amuletic set ol the Four Sons of Horus continued to be supplied. Either they were stitched onto the bandages over the mummy's torso by means of the holes provided, or they were incorporated into the bead netting which enveloped contemporary mummies.
