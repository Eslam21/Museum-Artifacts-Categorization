{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA8493"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Qen: there are two registers on this round-topped stela with lightly incised texts and figures in sunk relief. In the upper register Ra-Horakhty is seated on the left facing the goddess Meresger who is similarly seated on the right. In the lower register the chiseller of Amun, Qen, kneels on the right with his arms raised in adoration. On the left the lady of the house, Nfrt-\u1ec9ry is similarly depicted. The stela is not in a good state of preservation. It is badly worn with numerous small cracks. Traces of yellow paint can be seen on the hieroglyphs, the background and parts of the figures. There are the remains of red paint on the bodies of the figures in the lower register and on the body of the god and on his throne in the upper register. There are traces of blue paint on the serpent's head of Meresger. Spots of a black substance are found adhering to parts of the stela.
