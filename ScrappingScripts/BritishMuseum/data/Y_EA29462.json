They are normally made in Egyptian blue, like here. The ram's head reproduces the rhyton shape popular in both Greek coroplastic and coins. This shape can also be related to the ram-headed god Amun-Ra of Baded, the main local Egyptian god revered at Naukratis. This scaraboid belongs to a type which was widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Eastern Greece, and Southern Russia (Gorton 1996, 121-127, type XXXIV, subtype B26-29, see especially B26 for this piece). A similar motif is found on a scarab (BM 1888,0601.56) and scaraboid from Naukratis (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 88.860).
