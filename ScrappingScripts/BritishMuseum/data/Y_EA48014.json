{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA48014"], "Description": [" Blue/green glazed composition figure of a monkey riding a horse: this statuette shows an oversized simian hitching a ride on an undersized horse. The monkey has apparently just landed on the back of the horse, which is rearing in surprise. The animals' heads face in opposite directions: the horse is about to turn one way, while the monkey is looking back, furtively or defiantly. He certainly knows he is doing something wrong - horses were much-prized animals.
