{"artifact_name": "coffin(fragment)", "Object Type": ["coffin (fragment)"], "Museum number": ["EA95984"], "Description": [" Fragment of rectangular coffin showing different scenes and inscriptions in black pigment on a yellow background, with traces of red pigments. The lower part depicts a row of figures, including a ram (?) head on a knife, a black ram and a duck holding a knife. Only traces of the upper part remain and the decoration might have been part of a star clock. The back of the fragment is undecorated with a hole drilled (not going through). Two edges of the fragments are clean cut (we cannot exclude they are original edges of the plank).
