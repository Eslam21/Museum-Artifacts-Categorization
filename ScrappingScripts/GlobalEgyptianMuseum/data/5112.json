{"Present location": "KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM [09/001] VIENNA", "Inventory number": "5776", "Dating": "SENWOSRET II/SESOSTRIS II/KHAKHEPERRE", "Archaeological Site": "UNKNOWN", "Category": "STATUE", "Material": "ANORTHOSITE", "Technique": "CARVED; SCULPTURED", "Height": "24.8 cm", "Width": "22.2 cm", "Depth": "14 cm", "Name": "Upper part of a royal statue (Senwosret II ?)", "Description": "There are good grounds for attributing this fragment of a royal statue to Senwosret II. In spite of the slight damage to the surface of the face, especially the nose, this is clearly a deliberate portrait of a king. Framed by the broad royal head-dress or Nemes with uraeus on the forehead, the face is characterized by two large ears that stick out somewhat, typical of statues of the 12th Dynasty. The relatively small eyes are not quite symmetrical and are marked by thick curved eyelids and tear ducts. The royal portrait conveys the impression of an energetic self-assured ruler in a very individual way."}
