{"artifact_name": "artefact", "Object Type": ["artefact"], "Museum number": ["EA36861"], "Description": [" Rectangular limestone block inscribed with the names and titles of several individuals from Deir el-Medina. The block is slightly irregular in shape with one side broader than the other. Across each side of the surface is a brief line of incised text. Across the wider side are two offering formulae to the god Ptah that begin in the middle of the line and continue onto the small edges of the block and opposite narrower side. Two individuals Wennekhu and Hormin are named across this area, and there are small traces of blue paint in some hieroglyph signs within these lines. There are also traces of white paint across the block particularly along the top, which includes another incised text bearing the name of another workman Amenemwia. Each of these texts are also defined by a thin border that includes traces of red paint. The text carved across the base is the only example that has no surviving traces of painted detail and is slightly damaged. Here, the text refers to an outline draughtsman named Parahotep. There are some small chips to the stone surface and discolouration across the short left side of the block which partially obscures some of the text.
