Papyrus written with black and red ink; demotic text recto and verso: spells and recipes; Old Coptic glosses. On the recto are a series of spells and recipes arranged in twenty-nine columns written between ruled lines. These include spells for divination, love spells, poisons and spells of healing. On the verso are apparently discontinuous memoranda, prescriptions and short invocations. Recto: PDM xiv. 1-92 (cols. 1/1-3/35): Vessel Divination Verso: PDM xiv. 1155-62 (col. 25vo/1-8): Love Spell PDM xiv. 1163-79 (cols. 26vo/1-27vo/8): Vessel Divination The spells are typical products of the syncretistic culture of Late Antiquity. This very late demotic papyrus was sold in two parts in Thebes, the first part going to London and the second to Leiden, where it proved important in deciphering the demotic script, since the text contains glosses in a mixture of Greek and demotic characters now known as Old Coptic. The entire roll measured some 5 m.
