These notes were presumably written in 1884-1885 when Petrie excavated at Naukratis, although they could have been written in 1885- 1886, when he visited the site. Although not definitely from Naukratis, this is the most likely provenance."], "Bibliographic references": ["Villing et al 2013-2015 / Naukratis: Greeks in Egypt (WC.18) (Phase 3)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Acquisition name": ["Donated by: Egypt Exploration Fund (?)"], "Acquisition date": ["1886 (?)"], "Department": ["Greek and Roman"], "Registration number": ["2012,5016.15"]}
