{"Present location": "EGYPTIAN MUSEUM [01/001] CAIRO EM", "Inventory number": "JE 61326 A,B", "Dating": "TUTANKHAMUN/NEBKHEPERURE", "Archaeological Site": "VALLEY OF THE KINGS", "Category": "MODEL", "Material": "PLASTER; ROCK", "Technique": "CARVED", "Name": "Model of Grain Mill with Grinding Stone", "Description": "The tomb of Tutankhamun gave us a clear idea of the complete equipment of a royal tomb of the Pharaonic era. Not only were funerary items placed in the tomb, but objects used during the lifetime of the king were also placed there for use in the hereafter. This model of a grain mill is made of wood and was preserved in the tomb with its grinding stone. The symbolic use of this miniature mill by the king in the afterlife is obvious. He had intended to secure wheat for his bread in case no offerings would be presented to him. A miniature model of a granary full of seeds was also found in the tomb."}
