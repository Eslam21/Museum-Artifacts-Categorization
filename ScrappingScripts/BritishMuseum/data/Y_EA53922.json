The outer layer shows inserted patches that are also inserted in the inner layers. They are secured with a passepoil. The seam(?) between the patches might indicate that at least the outer layer consisted of an upper and lower element. The extending layer of remarkably thick leather has been cut short and might have acted as a protective flap. It is uncertain if this flap\u2019s leather makes up the inner lining as well.
