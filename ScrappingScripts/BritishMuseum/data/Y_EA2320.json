{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA2320"], "Description": [" Wooden male figure: the face is idealized; the smile is derived ultimately from the benign curve in the lips of Amenhotep III, whose slight smile was emulated during the Amarna Period, at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and eventually on some representations of Ramses II in the Nineteenth Dynasty. The man's costume places him in the last decades of the Eighteenth Dynasty or the first years of the Nineteenth. He wears a double wig, shirt, and kilt. The front sections of the double wig comprise large, full bunches of curls, spilling down onto the chest. The shirtsleeves were now much long, wide, and floppy. The kilt is entirely pleated, and the tucking and flouncing of its front panel is intricate. He was originally painted.
