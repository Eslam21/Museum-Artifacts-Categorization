The darker glaze has also been used for the single frontal column of hieroglyphic text, naming the owner as the lady of the house and chantress of Amun Djedmut. The titles of this woman indicate that she was married to a Theban man of sufficiently high status to bear a title himself. Figures such as these are often inscribed with a summons to answer for any work required of the person in the next life."}
