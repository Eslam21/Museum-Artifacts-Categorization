{"artifact_name": "bead; amulet", "Object Type": [" bead ", " amulet "], "Museum number": ["EA14695"], "Description": [" Amuletic string: composed of small bright-blue glass disc beads, one blue glazed composition disc bead and thirty-one gold vase-shaped beads. The glass beads are almost certainly New Kingdom in date, but the vase-shaped beads are probably Middle Kingdom. The latter are made in three parts: the neck is a tube of sheet gold, the body is made in two parts, upper and lower, and the lip is a separate piece. The tube of the neck fits inside the upper half of the bowl. The lip is formed from a disc with a hole in the middle, shaped into a small funnel which is pushed into the top of the neck. The base of each vase has a hole in it which has been punched through from the inside, leaving a slight burr. The vase-shaped beads are graded in size: the largest are in the centre of the string, while the smallest ones, are at the ends.
