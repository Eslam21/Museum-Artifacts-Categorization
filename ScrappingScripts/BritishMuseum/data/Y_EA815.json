{"artifact_name": "stela", "Object Type": ["stela"], "Museum number": ["EA815"], "Description": [" Limestone stela of Qen: this fragmentary round-topped stela bears a scene in raised relief with incised texts. Osiris stands in the centre facing right and behind him stands the deified Amenhotep I with one arm raised. On the right the goddess Hathor was depicted as a cow emerging from the mountain, but most of this part of the scene has been lost. Below are four columns of text naming the chiseller Qen, son of \u1e6e\u0292-nfr, and Ma\u02bfetnefret, whose name is lost, his wife Nfrt-\u1ec9ry and his son Mry-mry. Only two fragments of the original stela survive. They have been joined together in modern times, and the features of the gods have been restored. The surviving pieces are worn along the edges and chipped in places. There appear to be traces of red paint on the skirt of Amenhotep I. The lower edge is blackened, possibly by fire.
