{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Museum number": ["EA65568"], "Description": [" A hollow terracotta figure of a saddled horse, modelled in the round, but the legs not divided. Details of the harness, including the breastband and crupper, are in relief, and horse-brasses hang from them; on one side, within double relief lines on the neck, is a row of small conjoined circles, and on the other is a circle at each end of the delineated area. The saddle is also in relief, with two holes through its raised front. Suspension holes are pierced through the neck and the tail. The mane is slightly damaged. Two-piece mould. Micaceous pink Aswan kaolinite clay, with an overall yellow to brown slip. Details of the harness, saddle, the eyes, mane and tail are picked out in black and red fired-on ceramic colours, as also is a broad band down the front, defining the front legs.
