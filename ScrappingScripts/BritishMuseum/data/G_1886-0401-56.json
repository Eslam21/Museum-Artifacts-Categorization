The one sided curved three quarter ovolo moulding is accompanied on both sides by a sharp labium. The adjoining surface is on the inner side of the curve concave, on the outer convex. On the convex outer side \u2018lies\u2019 a ca. 5 mm \u2018deep\u2019 and smooth relief layer. The radius of 16,6 cm of the preserved circle curve was reconstructed, by means of a stencil.

The shape of the attached ornament is no longer visible. Since the circle curve could also have been part of a volute, a connection of the fragment to a capital or an altar volute was considered. Because of the concave-convex surface and the thickness of the \u2018shell\u2019, such a connection could not have existed. Therefore no interpretation of this fragment could been made yet.
