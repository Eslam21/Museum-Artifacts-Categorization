In fact, the composition has been compiled from different motifs in D\u00fcrer's prints. The fortified town in the background derives from D\u00fcrer's Life of the Virgin, 'Christ taking leave from his mother' (Meder 204), the detail of God and the Holy Spirit perhaps from the same series, 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt' (Meder 202), the Virgin and Child may be inspired by Meder 31. The shape of the tablet with D\u00fcrer's monogram and the date 1520 is copied from D\u00fcrer's engravings of that date, but it is propped awkwardly on the grass verge."], "Bibliographic references": ["Bartsch / Le Peintre graveur (VII.64.45)"], "Location": ["Not on display"], "Subjects": ["virgin and child"], "Associated names": [" Representation of: Jesus Christ ", " Representation of: Virgin Mary "], "Acquisition name": [" Bequeathed by: Joseph Nollekens ", " Bequeathed through: Francis Douce "], "Acquisition date": ["1834"], "Acquisition notes": ["Bequeathed by Joseph Nollekens, subject to a life interest to Francis Douce, 1834."], "Department": ["Prints and Drawings"], "Registration number": ["E,2.17.+"]}
