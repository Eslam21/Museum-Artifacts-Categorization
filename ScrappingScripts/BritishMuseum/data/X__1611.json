{"artifact_name": "figure", "Object Type": ["figure"], "Description": [" Terracotta protome figure of a woman wearing veil or headdress. Archaic form of protome showing no attempt to indicate the shoulders, arms, or breasts. In front, the body presents a flat surface relieved only by two slightly raised bands of dark colour which seem to mark the border of the veil. Its total length from the chin downwards is about equal to that of the head. The head-dress rises up stiffly from the forehead, and appears to consist of a stephane covered by the veil; the ears, from which hang large circular ornaments, are modelled on its surface. Advanced naturalistic treatment of the hair and facial features; eyes naturalistic, but almond shaped, the forehead and nose presents a slightly curved line; the chin is not dimpled; mouth naturalistic with corner hollows. The hair runs in a number of wavelets along the top of the forehead. Mould-made and hollow. White coating preserved on some areas. Pale red-brown fabric with grey core.

", " Found in the '5th century BC' context in the Hellenion (area 14), under the wall of second temple. Gutch dated this piece to the early 5th century BC and supplied a Rhodian provenance (Gutch 1898-9,78, pl.10.10). Early and late 5th century BC parallels are known from Rhodes, in the British Museum (Higgins 1970, nos 141 and 294), though these were imported there from south Ionia. Parallel from Cyzicus, thought to be of early 5th century BC Clazomenean manufacture (Louvre, Paris CA 615). Protomes (also called busts, shoulder-busts, protome-busts and erroneously \u2018masks\u2019) were first made in East Greece around 550BC (Croissant 1983) then Greece (Robinson 1931; 1933; 1952; Szab\u00f3 1994) and Magna Graeca (Kilmer 1977, 65-7) in the late Archaic period. The earliest forms simply show the head with a framing veil, though increased complexity and details resulted in half of the figure being represented by the 5th century BC (Mandel & Gossel-Raeck 2004). By the mid-5th century they become less common, though rare finds have been found, in Hellenistic contexts (Kilmer 1977, 66; Smith 1949, 355; Stampolid\u0113s et al. 2011, 383, no. 72). Protomes are primarily found in sanctuaries, graves (possibly reused Kilmer 1977, 68; not used as funeral masks, Smith 1949, 355) and occasionally in domestic contexts (Higgins 1954; Kilmer 1977, 68). Protomes have been interpreted as representations of Hera, Athena, Aphrodite (Aphrodite in Naukratis, Smith 1949, 355, fn. 3, figs. 6 & 7), Demeter or Kore as a chthonic goddess (contra Blinkenberg 1931, 588-9), but are more commonly thought to represent the devotee (ibid; Croissant 1983). Many fragmentary parallels of protomes and protome-busts from Naukratis in Archaic and Classical Greek style in East Greek and local Egyptian fabrics.
