{"artifact_name": "seal-impression", "Object Type": ["seal-impression"], "Museum number": ["EA86792"], "Description": [" Part of a seal-impression made of fine brown Nile clay that was hardened after excavation and shows darker discolouration and a partly glossy surface. The rear shows a convex side with traces of an object like a leather bag or a vessel neck, in the break three deep impressions of a turned cord with a width of about 0.3 cm. EA86792, EA86793, EA86799, EA86800, EA86801, EA86802 and EA86812 all show the same motif and seem to have sealed the same object, the rear should allow a reconstruction of the sealed object. Only a small part of the original surface is preserved with a small oval scarab-like impression and lots of finger impressions next to it. The same motif can be found on six sealings, allowing to reconstruct the full motif. EA86792, EA86793, EA86800 and EA86812 show the upper part, EA86799, EA86801 and EA86802 the lower part. A circumferential line is visible, on top a stylized n above a standing goddess with animal-head probably Sekhmet, facing to the left. She is holding a sceptre in front of her, a small nb-sign left of the sceptre.
